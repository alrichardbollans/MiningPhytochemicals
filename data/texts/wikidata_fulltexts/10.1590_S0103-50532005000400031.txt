Formigas cortadoras de folhas são consideradas pragas para a agricultura devido à grande
quantidade de material vegetal utilizado por elas para cultivar um fungo simbionte que lhes serve de
alimento e enzimas. O mutualismo entre o fungo e as formigas é um ponto a ser explorado quando
se considera sua possível aplicação em métodos alternativos para o controle desses insetos. Sabendo-
se que algumas plantas são naturalmente resistentes aos insetos fitófagos, alguns produtos naturais
(metabólitos secundários) devem ser avaliados em relação às suas propriedades inseticidas e/ou
fungicidas. Neste trabalho foram isoladas oito cumarinas de quatro espécies de plantas e o efeito no
desenvolvimento do fungo simbionte das formigas cortadeiras Atta sexdens foi determinado. Com
exceção da clausarina, todas as outras cumarinas foram inibitórias de 64 µg mL-1 à 80 µg mL-1 sendo
que a xantiletina inibiu o fungo na concentração de 25 µg mL-1.
Leaf-cutting ants are known to be a serious pest for agriculture due to the high amounts of vegetal
matter from crops used by them in order to cultivate a symbiotic fungus on which they rely for food and
enzymes. The mutualism between the fungus and the ants is a point to be explored when alternative
methods of control are being thought of. Considering that some plants are naturally resistant to
phytophagous insects, some natural products (secondary metabolites) should be evaluated with respect
to their insecticide and/or fungicide properties. In this paper we isolated eight coumarins from four
different plant species and we determined their effect on the development of the symbiotic fungus of the
leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens. With the exception of clausarin, all the other coumarins were inhibitory
from 64 µg mL-1 through 80 µg mL-1 and xanthyletin inhibited the fungus at 25 µg mL-1
Keywords: leaf-cutting ants, coumarins, symbiotic fungus inhibition
Introduction
Leaf-cutting ants, the dominant herbivores in the
tropics, can be found from the Southern United States to
Northern Argentina.1 They cultivate a symbiotic fungus
for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate, thus damaging
agriculture.2
It is known that plants have several mechanisms to
avoid herbivores, including a set of toxic chemicals.3 The
presence of secondary plant metabolites toxic to the ants
and/or to their symbiotic fungi may play an important role
in whether the ants will cut such plants or not.4
Many of the most important crops cultivated in our
country are exotic species, which have not had the
possibility of co-evolution with predators and as such are
preferentially attacked.5
Different methods have been proposed for the control of
these ants (organophosporus, pyrethroids and sulfluramid
insecticides). However, problems with non-target animals,
high chemical stability and environmental contamination
are common and it is necessary to continue looking for new
strategies to control these insects.6 The search for specific
compounds directed against these ants and their microbial
partners has been the focus of our studies during the past
years and natural chemicals isolated from a variety of plant
species were effective against the ants and inhibited the
growth of their symbiotic fungus or both.6-15
Among the several biological properties of coumarins
we can find dermal photosensitising, estrogenic,
antimicrobial, vasodilator, molluscicidal, antihelmintic,
670 Godoy et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
sedative and hypnotic, analgesic and hypothermic
activities,16,17 but they have been associated mainly with
anticoagulant activity.18 Indeed, they are widely found in
several botanical families such as Rutaceae, Apiaceae,
Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Moraceae and
Thymeleaceae and it seems to correlate with their action
as phytoalexins. Repellent action to beetles and other
terrestrial invertebrates and the inhibition of both
sporulation and the growth of some fungal plant pathogens
by some coumarins were described by Weinmann.19
The aim of this study was to analyze the activity of
eight coumarins isolated from different plant species on
the development of the symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting
ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa.
Experimental
Preparation and fractioning of crude extracts
Different parts of plants were ground to powder, dried
at 40 °C and percolated with a set of organic solvents
(hexane, dichloromethane and methanol) during 72 hours
three times each at room temperature for three days,
followed by the evaporation of the solvent under reduced
pressure at 40 °C. The crude extracts were fractionated
through flash chromatography under vacuum with silica
gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (hexane,
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol). They were
then purified through different techniques including
column chromatography, preparative TLC and HPLC.
Coumarins
Angelicin (1), suberosin (2), xanthoxyletin (3) and
clausarin (4) were isolated from the methanol extract of
the roots of Citrus limonia. Isopimpinellin (5) was isolated
from the dichloromethane extract of the roots of
Adiscanthus fusciflorus Ducke. Umbelliferone (6) was
isolated from the hydroalcoholic extract of the barks of
Picramnia teapensis, xanthyletin (7) and 7-hydroxy-3-
(1´1´-dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (8) were isolated
from the dichloromethane extract of the stems of Pilocarpus
riedelianus.
All the coumarins were identified through
spectrometric techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS
and IR and compared to literature data for (1); 20 (2); 21-23
(3);22, 24 (4); 22 (5); 22, 23, 25-27 (6); 28 (7); 28, 29 (8).30
Fungus
The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer)
Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from a
laboratory nest of Atta sexdens L.
The medium for fungus maintenance and methods for
the bioassays were previously described.10 One mL of
dichloromethane solution of each coumarin was added to
9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose,
10.0; sodium chloride, 5.0; peptone, 5.0; malt extract, 10.0
and agar, 15.0. Control tubes received 1.0 mL of
dichloromethane and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition,
the tubes were autoclaved at 121 oC by 15 min and then
slanted. The final concentration of each coumarin in µg
mL-1 was: 1=72; 2=64; 3= 70; 4=75; 5=80; 6=65; 7=25
and 8=75. The fungal suspension was prepared by
transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained
from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an
all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1 g L–1)
and gently fragmented. One mL of this suspension was
spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at
25(±1) oC for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two sets
of five tubes each). Controls with and without solvent as
well as with PBO (9) (commercial piperonil butoxide –
Pirisa Piretro Industrial, 97LO106IO) were run
simultaneously. Fungal growth was estimated
macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and
density using the modal value.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of the isolated
coumarins and on Table 1 we can see the effects of the
coumarins on the fungal growth. Except for clausarin (4),
which had no effect on the fungal development at a
concentration of 75 µg mL-1, all the others inhibited the
fungus at different degrees. Thus, at 72 µg mL-1, angelicin
(1) was responsible for a moderate (40%) inhibition of
fungal growth whereas an inhibition of 60% was achieved
with umbelliferone (6) at 65 µg mL-1. Strong inhibition
(80% at 75 µg mL-1) was observed with 7-hydroxy-3-(1’,1’-
dimethylallyl)-8-methoxycoumarin (8) and total
inhibition of fungal growth was observed with suberosin
(2), xanthoxyletin (3) and isopimpinellim (5) at
concentrations ranging from 64 to 80 µg mL-1.
Unfortunately, we did not have enough material to
determine whether suberosin, xanthoxyletin and
isopimpinellim could be inhibitory at a lower
concentration. Victor31 had shown total inhibition of the
fungus in the presence of xanthyletin (7) at concentrations
of 100 and 50 µg mL-1. The same effect was now observed
at 25 µg mL-1 showing that this compound should be better
evaluated in respect to its potential in the control of these
insects.
671Inhibition of the Symbiotic Fungus of Leaf-Cutting Ants by CoumarinsVol. 16, No. 3B, 2005
Five out of the eight coumarins assayed were isolated
from the roots of Citrus limonia and Adiscanthus
fusciflorus. Natural coumarins are synthesized by plants
as a response to injury during the wilting process, diseases
or drying and accumulate on the surface of leaves, fruits
and seeds. According to Ojala32 their presence in the roots
may provide a tool against microbial invasion.
Attempts to correlate structure and antimicrobial
activity of coumarins were made by some authors. Kayser
and Kolodziej33 reported that highly oxygenated
coumarins and the positions of the polar hydroxyls and of
the less polar methoxy groups on the aromatic nucleus are
important for antibacterial activity. Yet, according to Dini
et al. (apud Sardari et al.34) the occurrence of the aromatic
hydroxy group and/or ether or ester groups at positions 6
or 7 of the basic structure are important for antifungal
action. For them, alkylated derivatives of 7-
hydroxycoumarins can have both antifungal and
antibacterial properties. On the other hand, Sardari et al.34
did not find antifungal activity of coumarins with a
hydroxy group at position 7, as observed with
umbelliferone, which showed low activity against Candida
albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger
but they found a relationship between antifungal activity
and the presence of free 6–OH and 6–OMe. The results of
Sardari et al.34 were confirmed by Ojala et al.35 with C.
albicans, A. niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae but not
for the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium culmorum to
which umbelliferone was highly inhibitory. So, if some
structure-activity relationship can be made, the hypothesis
about a possible species-specific activity cannot be
discarded.
Except for clausarin (4) our results showed that the
seven linear coumarins assayed inhibited the symbiotic
fungus of A. sexdens at low concentrations whereas a low
inhibition was achieved with angelicin. Since angelicin
was the only angular coumarin assayed in this work it was
not possible to establish at this moment any relationship
between antifungal activity and linearity. Also the
occurrence of prenyl and MeO groups linked to the basic
structure of coumarins should be better studied in order to
determine if they are important or not for the antifungal
activity described here.
