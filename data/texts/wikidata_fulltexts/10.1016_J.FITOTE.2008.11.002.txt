Phytochemical investigation of Laureliopsis philippiana resulted in isolation of a new
bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid (1) named laureliopsine A. The structure was established by
spectroscopic methods, including 2D homo- and heteronuclear NMR experiments. This ﬁnding
of a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid in Laureliopsis supports its close relationship to
Atherosperma and its taxonomic segregation from Laurelia.

1. Introduction
Laureliopsis philippiana (Looser) Shodde is a slow growing,
shade tolerant tree found in Chile and Argentina [1,2]. Extracts
of the leaves have traditionally been used for the treatment of
colds andheadaches by theMapuchepeople [3]. Laureliopsis is a
monotypic genus belonging to theAtherospermataceae [4], and
previous investigations of stem bark constituents revealed the
presence of the monomeric aporphinoids asimilobine, ano-
naine, norcorydine, nornantenine, 4-hydroxynornantenine, and
(+)-reticuline [5–7]. In this study, a new6',7-epoxyanalogue (1)
of the berbamine subgroup of the bisbenzylisoquinolines was
identiﬁed in the extract of leaves from Laureliopsis philippiana.
2. Experimental
2.1. General
Optical rotation was measured using a Perkin-Elmer 241
polarimeter. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
NMR spectrometer (proton frequency 600.13 MHz) at 25 °C,
using TMS as internal standard. Gradient selected HMBC and
HSQC spectrawere optimized for nJC,H=7.7Hz and 1JC,H=145Hz,
respectively, and the NOESY experiment was acquired with a
mixing time of 600 ms. High-resolution mass measurements
for exact mass determination were performed on a Micromass
QTOF spectrometer equipped with an ESI ion source, operating
in positive-ion mode. Samples were dissolved in MeOH and
polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added for calibration. Column
chromatography was performed on Matrex Silica gel 60A
(particle size 70–200 µm). Alkaloid-containing fractions were
monitored using pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates using
Dragendorff's reagent for visualization.
2.2. Plant material
Leaves of Laureliopsis philippiana (Looser) Shodde [Ather-
ospermataceae] were collected in Chile (coastal area close to
Pucomo, Ozorno) in October 2006 by Alfonso Guzmán. A
voucher specimen (accession number: PM2001/5) has been
deposited in Herbarium C (Botanical Museum, University of
Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark) as well as at Universi-
dad de los Lagos, Ozorno, Chile.
2.3. Extraction and isolation
Powdered leaves (325 g) of L. philippiana were extracted
with CH2Cl2–MeOH (1:1) for 6 h using a Soxhlet extraction

system. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure
below 40° C to yield 67 g of dry crude extract. The residue was
dissolved in 1.5 L of 0.25 N H2SO4 and extracted twice with
1.5 L of CHCl3. The aqueous layer was basiﬁed (pH 11) using
2 N NH4OH and extracted twice with 1.5 L of CHCl3. The latter
chloroform extract was evaporated as described above to
yield 5.95 g of crude alkaloids. This fraction was subjected to
vacuum liquid chromatography (silica gel 60H (Merck),
8×12 cm i.d.) and eluted with heptane containing 33–75%
of CH2Cl2–MeOH (9:1). Fractions of 100 mL were assessed by
TLC and visualized with Dragendorff's reagent, and fractions
showing similar TLC-proﬁles were pooled into four fractions
A–D. Fraction B (655 mg) was further puriﬁed by column
chromatography (silica gel 60) using a 46×2 cm i.d. column
eluted with 300 mL of heptane-EtOAc (1:1) followed by
300 mL of heptane-EtOAc (2:3) to give 24 mg of 1.

3. Results and discussion
Repeated chromatographic separation of the leaf extract
resulted in isolation of 24mg of 1. Combined use of the 1H, 13C,
and DEPT NMR experiments showed the presence of two
methoxy groups, two N-methyl groups, ﬁve methylenes, 12

methines and 15 quaternary carbon atoms, which together
with information obtained from MS ([M+H]+ 575.2100) led to
the molecular formula C36H34N2O5. The structure of 1 (Fig. 1)
was established by combined use of COSY, NOESY, HSQC and
HMBC experiments. Thus, the spin systems H-3–H-4, H-1–H-
15 and H-10–H-13–H-14 were identiﬁed by analysis of the
COSY spectrum, and they were correlated with the benzyli-
soquinoline moiety containing H-5 by correlation pathways
found in the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2). Correlations observed
in the NOESY spectrum also established the position of the
methoxy groups at C-6 and C-12, respectively, and the N-
methyl group at position 2. Similarly, analysis of spectral data
starting with H-15' as anchoring point allows assignment of
all 1H and 13C resonances of the second benzylisoquinoline
moiety. Thus, the NOESY correlation pathways H-15'→H-
16'→H-3'→H-4'→H-5' and H-15'→H-10' and H-14' together
with correlations found in the HMBC spectrum (see Fig. 2)
established the structure of the second benzylisoquinoline
moiety, with the unusual exocylic double bond at C-1'. The
head-to-head connection of the twomoieties was established
by NOESY correlations observed between H-13' and H-10,
between H-8' and H-15A and H-1, and between H-5' and H-18
(see Fig. 2). Compound 1 is a new compound for which the
name laureliopsine A is suggested.
This is the ﬁrst report of a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid
from Laureliopsis philippiana and this ﬁnding is very impor-
tant from a chemotaxonomic point of view. One of the ﬁrst
alkaloids from this group, berbamine, was isolated from
Atherosperma moschatum from Australia more than 100 years
ago [8]. The presence of these alkaloids further supports the
connection between Laureliopsis and Atherosperma. Together
with the genus Nemuaron, these two genera form a well
deﬁned clade within the Atherospermataceae, which sepa-
rated from the genus Laurelia 83 million years ago as
estimated in the most recent phylogenetic investigations of
the Laurales [9,10]. Further investigations of other parts of the
plant would be of great interest as well as correlation of future
chemotaxonomic information with DNA-based phylogenetic
investigations.
