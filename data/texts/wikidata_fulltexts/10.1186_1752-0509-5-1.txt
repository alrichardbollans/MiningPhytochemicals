Abstract
Background: Deciphering the metabolome is essential for a better understanding of the cellular metabolism as a
system. Typical metabolomics data show a few but significant correlations among metabolite levels when data
sampling is repeated across individuals grown under strictly controlled conditions. Although several studies have
assessed topologies in metabolomic correlation networks, it remains unclear whether highly connected metabolites
in these networks have specific functions in known tissue- and/or genotype-dependent biochemical pathways.
Results: In our study of metabolite profiles we subjected root tissues to gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass
spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) and used published information on the aerial parts of 3 Arabidopsis genotypes, Col-0
wild-type, methionine over-accumulation 1 (mto1), and transparent testa4 (tt4) to compare systematically the
metabolomic correlations in samples of roots and aerial parts. We then applied graph clustering to the constructed
correlation networks to extract densely connected metabolites and evaluated the clusters by biochemical-pathway
enrichment analysis. We found that the number of significant correlations varied by tissue and genotype and that
the obtained clusters were significantly enriched for metabolites included in biochemical pathways.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that the graph-clustering approach identifies tissue- and/or genotype-dependent
metabolomic clusters related to the biochemical pathway. Metabolomic correlations complement information
about changes in mean metabolite levels and may help to elucidate the organization of metabolically functional
modules.
Background
Combining and integrating different ‘omics’ data such as
transcript-, protein-, and metabolite levels and enzyme
activities is essential for a full understanding of the nature
of the cellular metabolism as a system [1-4]. With respect
to transcript levels, a large amount of microarray data is
publicly available for Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant.
Such large datasets facilitate the construction of gene co-
expression databases [5] and the survey of transcriptome
organization [6-8]. Integrating transcript- and metabolite
data by, for example, studying the correlation relationships
among profiled data, facilitates the characterization of
unknown gene functions, and furthers our understanding
of plant cellular systems [9-11].
The correlation between variables (e.g. genes and meta-
bolites) is also important for multivariate statistical ana-
lyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) and
hierarchical cluster analysis. Typical metabolite-profiling
data show a few, but significant correlations among
metabolite levels when data sampling is repeated across
individuals grown under strictly controlled conditions
[12]. The metabolomic correlation as well as gene co-
expression are not always in agreement with known bio-
chemical pathways. Metabolomic correlation approaches
have highlighted some properties (e.g. modularity and
scale-freeness) in several species including plants [13-16].
Steuer et al. [17], who provided a relationship between
the structure of a metabolomic-correlation network and
a metabolic reaction network using a Jacobian matrix,
found that the relationship is not simple. They pointed
out that small fluctuations such as glucose availability
can result in a certain correlation pattern and persist
through metabolic pathways. Using metabolic control
analysis (MCA) and correlation analysis based on meta-
bolomic data, Camacho et al. [18] suggested that metabo-
lites are strongly correlated when they respond in the
same directions to all perturbations (fluctuations) in

mical equilibrium were suggested as one origin of a high
correlation. Muller-Linow et al. [19] applied network
similarity, a graph-theoretic parameter, to compare meta-
bolomic correlation networks with biochemical reactions
derived from the KEGG database [20]. They reported
that these networks were in disagreement and that close-
ness in metabolomic correlation is not an indicator of
closeness in biochemical networks. Studies on the effect
of changes in environmental conditions and temporal-
and spatial assessments of the topology of metabolomic
correlation networks have been reported [19,21,22].
Further investigation of the properties of metabolomic
correlation networks may discover whether highly con-
nected metabolites, the so-called ‘modules’, in the corre-
lation network reflect known biochemical pathways.
We investigated similarities and dissimilarities in meta-
bolomic correlations in the aerial parts of 3 Arabidopsis
genotypes, Col-0 wild-type (WT), methionine-over accu-
mulation 1 (mto1) [23], and transparent testa4 (tt4) [24].
Elsewhere [25] we reported that the mutation in cystathio-
nine g-synthase (CGS) and/or the over-accumulation of
methionine (Met) strongly affect the correlation networks
in aerial parts of mto1. In the present study, using gas
chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-
TOF/MS), we measured the relative metabolite levels in
root samples of the 3 Arabidopsis genotypes to assess tis-
sue- and/or genotype-dependent changes in their metabo-
lite levels. We systematically compared the metabolomic
correlations observed in 2 different datasets, the roots and
the aerial parts. Multivariate statistical analyses showed
the distinct metabolome of these plants and tissues. We
then constructed correlation networks by pair-wise corre-
lation between the metabolites and performed graph clus-
tering using the DPClus algorithm [26] that efficiently
extracts densely connected metabolites in a large-scale
network. We then evaluated the obtained clusters with
KEGG [20] enrichment analysis. Our results demonstrate
that changes in each network topology are tissue- and/or
genotype-dependent and that they reflect, at least partially,
known biochemical pathways in Arabidopsis.
Results
Metabolic phenotypes of the roots of 3 Arabidopsis
genotypes
The experimental workflow is shown in Figure 1. Roots
of Col-0 wild-type (WT), mto1,a n dtt4 mutants were
sampled and analyzed. We detected 166 metabolite
peaks including mass spectral tags (MSTs) [27] by the

lites including carbohydrates, amino-, fatty-, and organic
acids and vitamins, and others were secondary metabo-
lites (Additional file 1). For comparisons with data from
aerial parts we selected 59 commonly-detected metabo-
lites in both datasets using MetMask http://metmask.
sourceforge.net[28], a tool for metabolite identifier
linking.
By PCA we visually inspected the metabolite profiles
of the roots and aerial parts based on commonly
detected metabolites and all peaks (Figure 2). To con-
firm the most important principal components (PC) of
these samples we prepared score plots for each dataset.
As in aerial parts, samples of mto1 roots were clearly
separated while samples of tt4 roots were close to WT
along the second component axis (Figures 2A and 2B).
The loading plots highlighted and visualized metabolites
with a significant role in genotype separation. For exam-
ple, methionine (Met), urea, glycine, and pipecolate had
a strong impact on the roots and aerial parts of mto1
and tt4 (primarily the first principal component). The
complete list of metabolites that contributed to the
separation of the mutant profile groups from WT (dis-
criminative metabolites) is shown in Additional file 2. In
the PCA score plots of the 59 metabolites, the first prin-
cipal component (PC1) clearly discriminated between
mto1- and the control samples (Figures 2C and 2D). To
obtain further insights into the interpretation of our
PCA results, we re-calculated PCA by removing the four
most influencing metabolites (methionine, urea, glycine,
and pipecolate) from the original data matrices. Addi-
tional file 3 shows the score and loading plots of roots
(A) and aerial parts (B) using 55 metabolite datasets.
The PCA plots revealed that asparagine and glutamine
strongly contributed to PC1 separation in both the roots
and aerial parts (see Discussion).
The number of significant correlations depends on the
tissue/genotype and their differential correlations
To evaluate the correlations among the metabolite pro-
files observed in each tissue and genotype we calculated
the Spearman correlation coefficient (r). The significant
correlations (local false discovery rate (fdr) < 0.05; see
ref [29]) for each tissue and each genotype are shown in
Figure 3. All resultant correlations are listed in Addi-
tional file 4.
We first examined the number of significant correla-
tions between tissues. We found that the number of sig-
nificant correlations in WT and mto1 roots was larger
than in their aerial parts (Figure 3A); it was also much
larger in the aerial parts of tt4 than its roots. Then, we
compared differences between correlations in roots and
aerial parts using Fisher Z-transformation (see Meth-
ods). Similarly, we also compared differential correla-
tions between genotypes. The number of statistical
differences between correlations in roots and aerial parts
in WT, mto1,a n dtt4 w a s7 ,8 ,a n d2 1 ,a l t h o u g ht h e r e
were no significant changes in the correlations between

statistical analysis PCA, the rank product method, and the metabolomic correlations by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Then we
constructed the metabolomic correlation networks. Using DPClus [26] we extracted densely connected metabolites. Lastly, we characterized each
cluster based on the KEGG enrichment analysis to assess statistical significance.

WT and tt4 in roots (fdr < 0.05) (Figure 3B and
Additional file 4). Our findings imply that in both tis-
sue-types, the mto1 mutation strongly affects the meta-
bolomic correlation network, and that there are many
correlations intensified by a lack of the chalcone
synthase (CHS) gene. Our observations also suggest that
the tendency for changes in the number of significant
correlations is similar within the studied tissues of the 3
genotypes.
Construction of a metabolomic correlation network and
selection of the correlation threshold
For visualization and to gain insights into the metabolo-
mic correlations for each tissue and genotype we con-
structed correlation networks. The selection of an
appropriate threshold is important for the construction
of such a correlation network, if it is too high the gener-
ated network will be sparse, if too low, only a large con-
nected component will be produced. To assess
threshold-dependent changes in the network topology
we computed 6 graph-theoretic measures (Additional
files 5 and 6), i.e., the graph density, clustering coeffi-
cient, average degree, average path length, number of
connected components, and the number of edges (for
example, see [30]). We also compared the statistics of
the real data and 100 randomized data (dots in
Additional files 5 and 6). We observed that the number
of connected components showed a transition from
small to large at a correlation threshold of 0.5 (arrows
in Additional file 5). Therefore, we set the threshold at
r ≥ 0.5. Although a threshold does not guarantee explicit
biological significance, we found that examining various
statistics among the constructed networks was useful for
selection.
Graph clustering identifies modules significantly enriched
for metabolites contained in biochemical pathways
At r ≥ 0.5, DPClus [26] identified 5, 5, and 4 clusters in
the metabolomic correlation network for the root sam-
ples of WT, mto1,a n dtt4, respectively; they ranged in
size from 6 to 29 metabolites. For the aerial parts of
WT, mto1,a n dtt4 we obtained 5, 7, and 5 clusters,
respectively; they ranged in size from 4 to 34 metabo-
lites (Additional file 7). We posit that this difference in
the number of clusters reflects differences in the net-
work topology, which, in turn, is tissue- and genotype-
dependent. To assess the significance of the clusters we
used the over-represented KEGG pathways (so-called
KEGG enrichment analysis) in the obtained- and rando-
mized clusters (see Methods and Table 1). The results
of graph clustering with KEGG enrichment analysis for
mto1 roots are presented in Figure 4. Our findings on
the other genotypes are listed in Table 2; they are

Page 5 of 12visualized in Additional file 8. The clusters obtained
with the graph clustering method involved the enriched
KEGG pathway and included the ‘alanine-, aspartate-,
and glutamate metabolism’ (p = 0.0021) in mto1 roots
(Figure 4). The statistical relevance of this approach was
evaluated with the S-value [6] that can be used for
assessing the significance of the clustering results based
on KEGG pathways (see Methods). As shown in
Figure 5, the averaged best p-value for significantly-
enriched KEGG pathways was better in real- than
randomized data.
Predominant pathways in clusters reflect tissue- and/or
genotype-dependent metabolomic regulation
Except for the clusters found in the aerial parts of WT
and mto1, the detected clusters tended to include ster-
oid biosynthetic pathways (Table 2). The strong correla-
tion between sterols confirmed our earlier observations
for aerial parts [25]. Metabolites belonging to fatty-acid
biosynthesis tended to cluster together. The clusters we
commonly found in the aerial parts of the 3 genotypes
were galactose metabolism. The largest cluster for the
aerial parts and roots of mto1 were ‘alanine, aspartate,
and glutamate metabolism.’ This suggests that the muta-
tion resulting in Met over-accumulation can affect the
metabolic pathway of the aspartate family. Metabolite
enrichment analysis using other mto mutants also
extracted the same pathways [31]. The largest cluster in
the roots of tt4 was ‘biosynthesis of alkaloids derived
from the shikimate pathway.’ For both tissues, tt4,

to this biosynthetic pathway (see Discussion and Addi-
tional file 2).
Discussion
We focused on the changes in the topology of metabo-
lomic correlation networks of 3 Arabidopsis genotypes
(WT, mto1,a n dtt4). When comparing the WT, the
increases and decreases in the number of significant
correlations for mto1 and tt4 were similar in their aerial
parts and roots. Our comparative studies showed
strongly altered metabolomic correlations in the roots of
mto1. As did Kusano et al. [25] in aerial parts, we
observed a marked increase in the number of significant
correlations in the roots of tt4 compared to the roots of
WT. As our study imposed no environmental perturba-
tions on the 3 genotypes, we suggest that the observed
changes in the topology of metabolomic correlation net-
works are attributable to underlying tissue- and/or gen-
otype-dependent biochemical regulations.
Graph clustering using DPClus [26] yielded densely
connected metabolites on the metabolomic correlation
networks. KEGG enrichment analysis to assess the sta-
tistical significance of the detected clusters demon-
strated specific differences in the clusters in the
enriched pathways. We posit that the assigned KEGG
pathways for each cluster reflect differences in underly-
ing genetic properties and in tissue- and/or genotype-
dependent biochemical regulations.
The largest cluster in mto1 roots was assigned as
the’alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism’.S i n c e
mto1 mutants are characterized by mutations involving
the aspartate pathway, the approach based on graph-
clustering proved itself useful for characterizing geno-
types. Although there were no significant enriched
KEGG pathways in cluster 5 in Figure 4, this cluster
may represent the extensive coordination among biosyn-
thetic pathways involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA)-cycle, and stress-responsive metabolites in
mto1 roots. Our approach may yield new insights into
the organization of metabolites in the functional path-
ways of a given organism. In tt4 roots, the largest cluster
was ‘biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from the shikimate
pathway’. This cluster contained metabolites associated
with the biosynthetic pathways of the TCA cycle and
with glycolysis because this KEGG pathway covered
extensive pathways from glycolysis to alkaloids via shiki-
mate for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids
including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. The
mutation in the CHS gene appears not to affect the bio-
synthesis of alkaloids in Arabidopsis. We posit that the
model plant Arabidopsis lacks the production of com-
plex alkaloids, although homologues for many enzymes
associated with alkaloid biosynthesis have been detected
in its genome [32]. Our multivariate statistical analysis
suggests that the mutation of CHS may influence nitro-
gen assimilation (Additional file 3). Furthermore, the
third cluster (Clus3) in tt4 roots was significantly
enriched for metabolites contained in ‘nitrogen metabo-
lism’ (Table 2), suggesting that our approach may reflect
underlying changes in the metabolism by lacking of
CHS in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our observations
demonstrate that variations in the topology of correla-
tion networks are tissue and/or genotype-dependent and

extracted 5 clusters in mto1 roots. The significant metabolic pathways were assigned by KEGG enrichment analysis (see Methods). The central
graph consisting of 5 blue clusters and 10 red edges was extracted by DPClus. Each blue cluster contains densely connected metabolites (see
Clus1 to 5). Small white nodes in the clusters indicate metabolites. Clus1 (top, left) shows the first cluster of the hierarchical graph. The internal
nodes of the clusters are connected by green edges; neighboring clusters are connected by red edges. Both cp and density values, DPClus
parameters, were set to 0.5. We used overlapping-mode in DPClus settings. The results obtained in the other 2 genotypes are shown in

Earlier studies indicated that the interpretation of meta-
bolomic correlations requires careful evaluation [12,17,18].
Our work demonstrates that graph clustering can be used
to gather metabolites belonging to the metabolic pathways
that change in response to different regulations that in
turn are dependent on the tissue and/or genotype. Our
analyses differ from those of [19] in that we examined the
densely connected metabolites in the correlation network
by statistical KEGG enrichment analysis instead of using
network similarity or proximity. Graph clustering
approaches have been effectively applied to gene co-
expression networks for extracting functional, densely
connected genes [6,33-35]. We showed that the approach
is also effective for metabolomic correlations.

Page 8 of 12Although we only evaluated 3 genotypes, the approach
based on graph clustering seems to be useful and applic-
able to the monitoring of changes in the topology of cor-
relation networks. As in the gene co-expression analysis
that involves thousands of microarrays, there were few
negative correlations in this study. For instance, the num-
ber of significant negative correlations (r <0a n df d r<
0.05) in the roots and aerial parts of WT was 17 and 6,
respectively. Therefore, we deliberately did not use nega-
tive correlations. Other similarity measures such as
mutual information [36] and partial correlation [37],
instead of Spearman correlation coefficients, may be
applied in this approach. Further studies are necessary to
assess to what extent these measures affect the graph
clustering results of metabolomic correlation networks.
There are few systematic comparisons of metabolomic
correlations among time series data [19]. Temporal and
spatial assessment of the topology in the metabolomic cor-
relation network may contribute to the development of
novel data-mining methods and to the discovery of bio-
markers [38]. There are also few published systematic
metabolomic comparisons under stress conditions. Szy-
manski et al. [21] demonstrated that the correlation net-
work approach can help to identify stress-dependent
regulatory mechanisms in Escherichia coli. Our current
report is a logical extension of our continued effort to
understand the regulation of the primary (especially Met
biosynthesis [25]) and the secondary (especially flavonoid
biosynthesis [39]) metabolism in Arabidopsis.O u r
approach contributes to the generation of new testable
hypotheses for further experiments and may expand our
fundamental understanding of the metabolic behaviors
affected by genetic and/or environmental perturbations.
Such information will contribute to the characterization of
unknown gene function(s) and help in the high-throughput
screening of metabolic phenotypes ranging from experi-
mental models to crops [40] and disease studies [41].
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that (1) differences in muta-
tions and/or tissues affect changes in the topology of
metabolomic correlation networks; (2) graph clustering
yields tissue- and/or genotype-dependent metabolomic
clusters related to respective biochemical pathways; and
(3) metabolomic correlations complement information
on changes in mean metabolite levels and the approach
based on metabolomic correlations yields insights into
the organization and regulation of metabolic modules.
Methods
Plant materials, growth, and harvest
For metabolomic correlation analysis we sampled tissues
from the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 wild-type
(WT), methionine over-accumulation 1 (mto1)[ 2 3 ] ,a n d
transparent testa4 (tt4) [24]. Data on the aerial part were
from [25]. The number of biological replicates in roots
was 53 (17 × WT, 16 × mto1, and 20 × tt4). We pooled 3
root samples as a batch for metabolite profiling.
Metabolite profiling
As described in [25], each sample was extracted, deriva-

processed all raw data using custom MATLAB software
(version 6.5; Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for hyphe-
nated data analysis (HDA) [42]; it performs baseline
correction, peak alignment, and peak deconvolution. For
metabolite identification we used the Golm Metabolome
Database (GMD) [27,43] and our in-house mass spectral
libraries.
Statistical data analysis
Metabolomic data were log2 transformed and then sta-
tistically analyzed using the rank product method [44]
to identify differentially changed metabolites with the
Bioconductor ‘RankProd’ package. Significantly changed
metabolites showed a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05.
The FDR value in the rank product was obtained with
1,000 random permutations. PCA was performed with
the Bioconductor ‘pcaMethods’ package [45].
To reduce outlier-related artifacts, the Spearman rank
correlation (r), which is relatively robust to outliers and is
based only on monotonicity, was used for comparative

The local false-discovery rate (fdr) was determined with
the ‘fdrtool’ package [29]. The significance level was set
at fdr < 0.05. All statistical tests were performed with
the R program http://www.r-project.org/.
Network analyses and graph clustering
To identify co-accumulated metabolite groups we used
DPClus [26], a graph clustering algorithm that can extract
densely connected nodes as a cluster. It is based on den-
sity- and periphery tracking of clusters. DPClus is freely
available from http://kanaya.naist.jp/DPClus/. In this study,
we used the overlapping-mode with the DPClus settings
because we are confident that extracting clusters with the
overlapping-mode is consistent with the overlapping of
many of the metabolic pathways and protein complexes.
We set the parameter settings of cluster property cp; den-
sity values were set to 0.5. The resulting clusters are listed
in Additional file 7. All network statistics such as graph
density were calculated in R with the ‘igraph’ package [46].
Generation of randomized clusters and assessment of
clustered modules in metabolomic correlation networks
To assess the statistical significance of clusters obtained by
graph clustering, we subjected datasets of the aerial parts
and roots of the 3 Arabidopsis genotypes and 100 ran-
domly-generated sets of clusters to KEGG enrichment.
Each randomized cluster was created by permutation of
the metabolite names without changing the cluster size.

is defined as a p-value (obtained from the test for
DPClus clusters) that is less than or equal to a pre-set
level of significance (p < 0.05). The probability of
obtaining any set of values was given by the hypergeo-

Additional material
Additional file 1: Raw data matrix used in this study. The normalized
data matrix of 166 peak areas of extracted mass spectra for 53 root
samples (17 × WT, 16 × mto1, and 20 × tt4; see also Methods).
Additional file 2: Discriminative metabolites of PCA loadings and
significant changes in the metabolite levels of WT, mto1, and tt4. All
59 metabolites that contributed to the separation of the mutant profiles
group from WT are shown: mto1/WT in the roots (A) and aerial parts (B)
and tt4/WT in the roots (C) and aerial parts (D). Differentially changed
metabolites were identified with the rank product method (see
Methods). Significantly changed metabolites manifested a false discovery
rate (FDR) < 0.05.
Additional file 3: PCA by removing four metabolites (methionine,
urea, glycine, and pipecolate) in (A) roots and (B) aerial parts using
datasets including 55 metabolites. See also the legend to Figure 2.
Additional file 4: List of metabolomic correlations based on
Spearman’s coefficient for the aerial parts and roots of WT, mto1,
and tt4. r1 and r2 represent the coefficient of WT and the mutant,
respectively. p1 and p2 are the p-value of the correlation test for WT and
the mutant, respectively. ‘p (diff)’ is the p-value of comparing correlations
using Fisher Z-transformation. (r1 - r2) is the subtraction of r2 from r1. ‘fdr’
is the local false discovery rate (fdr)-controlled p-value using the ‘fdrtool’
package [29].
Additional file 5: Correlation network properties of the 59
metabolites in the aerial parts across a range of correlation
coefficients. Networks were constructed for a range of correlation
thresholds from 0 to 1.0 by 0.01 increments, and each resulting network
was calculated for: (A) the graph density - the ratio of the number of
edges and the number of possible edges, (B) the clustering coefficient,
(C) the average degree of all nodes, (D) the average path length, (E) the
number of connected components, and (F) the number of metabolite-
metabolite correlations (edges) in the network. Within each plot, black
solid circles represent the observed data points; black dots represent 100
randomized data. This calculation was performed to generate a null
distribution.
Additional file 6: Correlation network properties of the 59
metabolites in roots across a range of correlation coefficients. See
details in the legend for Additional file 5.
Additional file 7: Resulting clusters detected by the DPClus
algorithm. For details, see the manual of DPClus http://kanaya.naist.jp/
DPClus/.
Additional file 8: Visualization of all DPClus clusters. See details in
the legend for Figure 4.
