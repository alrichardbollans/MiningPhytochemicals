A new prenylated pyranoxanthone, symphonin (1), 2-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-1,5- dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-2”,2”-dimethylpyrano (5”,6”:3,4) xanthone, the known compounds guttiferone A, oleanolic acid and  sitosterol  were isolated from the methanol extract of the seeds of Symphonia globulifera (Guttiferae). The structural elucidation of the new compound was based mainly on spectroscopic analyses. The new xanthone showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli.  KEY WORDS: Symphonia globulifera, Seeds, Xanthone, Antimicrobial activity   INTRODUCTION  The species Symphonia globulifera Linn. f. (syn. S. gabonensis Pierre) is a tree found mainly in lowland rainforests of tropical regions. In Cameroon, the inhabitants of the Central, South and Eastern provinces use the plant as a laxative for pregnant women and as a general tonic [1]. This species is a rich source of xanthones [2-5] and benzophenones [6-8]. There is a growing interest in constituents of the species because a number of secondary metabolites from it have been found to possess cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antimalarial and HIV-1 protease inhibitory activities [7-12]. As part of our research into members of the Guttiferae, we have investigated the seeds of S. globulifera and have isolated and characterized a new xanthone with antimicrobial activity.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Air-dried and ground seeds of Symphonia globulifera were extracted at room temperature with methanol and the extract concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residue showed weak activity at 300 µg/mL when tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli in the agar dilution-streak assay [13]. This residue, on repeated column chromatographic separation over silica gel, afforded pure compounds, including the new xanthone derivative (1) and the known compounds, guttiferone A (2), oleanolic acid (3) and sitosterol, which were identified by comparison with reported spectroscopic data  [7, 14].  Compound  (1), m.p. 213-214 °C, was obtained as a yellow solid and reacted positively with FeCl3, suggesting the presence of phenolic hydroxyl group (s). The molecular formula C25H26O7, with 13 degrees of unsaturation, was deduced from EIMS and 1D NMR data (Table 1). The IR spectrum of 1 exhibited strong absorption due to phenolic hydroxyl(s) (3290 cm-1), a hydrogen-Bruno N. Lenta et al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2004, 18(2) 176bonded carbonyl (1662 cm–1) and aromatic rings (1590 cm-1). The UV spectrum of 1 showed the specific absorption [λmax (237, 253, 285 and 346 nm)] of a xanthone nucleus [15]. This was confirmed in the 1H (two singlets, 1H each at δH 13.20 and 7.20 due to a chelated OH and a proton peri to a carbonyl function, respectively) and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) [2, 11, 12].  The 13C NMR spectrum revealed 25 carbon signals which were sorted by DEPT and HMQC experiments into four methyls, two methoxyls, four methines and 15 quaternary carbons including a carbonyl function (δC 180.2). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 exhibited the characteristic spin system of a 3,3-dimethylallyl moiety [δH 1.80 (3H, s); 1.60 (3H, s); 3.30 (2H, d, J = 7.2 Hz) and 5.20 (1H, m)], together with signals for two methoxyl groups  [δH 3.95 (3H, s) and 4.05 (3H, s)] and for the expected chelated hydroxyl group  [δH 13.20 (1H, s)]. Another hydroxyl proton appeared as a singlet, exchangeable with D2O, at δH 5.80. The presence of proton signals at δH 1.40 (6H, s, 2 x Me), 5.50 and 6.80 (1H each, d, J = 10.0 Hz) suggested the presence of a 2,2-dimethyl-2H-pyrano ring in 1. This was further supported by the set of signals at δC 28.2, 78.0, 126.8 and 115.5 in the 13C NMR spectrum [16]. In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 1, Table 1) the single aromatic proton at δH  7.20 gave cross-peaks with the carbonyl (δC  180.2) and two quaternary aromatic carbons bearing oxygens [δC 140.9 (C-7) and 149.2 (C-6)], consistent with its location at C-8, peri to the carbonyl group. In the same experiment, the methylene proton of the 3,3-dimethylallyl group at δ 3.34 (d, J = 7.2 Hz) showed cross-peaks with three quaternary carbons C-1 (δC 160.0), C-2 (δC 111.7) and C-3’ (δC  131.5) while the protons of the AB system of the 2,2-dimethyl-2H-pyrano ring (δH  6.80 and 5.50) were correlated to C-3  and C-2’’and and to C-4 and C-2”, respectively. The chelated proton (δH 13.20) had correlations to C-1, C-2 and C-9a. These results indicated that the 3,3-dimethylallyl group was attached to C-2 while the chromene moiety was attached to C-3 and C-4 of ring A of the xanthone nucleus. The remaining substituents, two methoxyls and the free OH, were placed on ring B. The free OH (δH 5.80) had cross-peaks with C-6 (C 140.9) whereas the two methoxyl groups at δH 3.95 and 4.04 correlated with C-6 (δC 140.9) and C-7 (δC 149.2), respectively. In addition, the C-7 methoxy had a NOE with H-8. These observations clearly demonstrated that the two methoxyls were located at C-6 and C-7 and the free OH at C-5. Thus the structure of the new xanthone, which we have named symphonin, was characterized as 1, 2-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-1,5-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-2’’,2”-dimethylpyrano (5”,6”:3,4) xanthone. In addition to 1, three known compounds were also isolated and identified as the guttiferone A (2), oleanolic acid (3) and sitosterol [7, 14].

EXPERIMENTAL  General. Melting points were determined on a Buchi melting point apparatus B-545. UV spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu-265 spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer B4FT-IR spectrometer with KBr pellets. NMR spectra were run on a Bruker spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm 1H and 13C probe operating at 400.1 and 100.6 MHz, respectively, with TMS as internal standard. The chemical shifts () are reported in ppm with the solvent signal, (H 7.25 and C 77.0 for CDCl3) as reference, while coupling constants (J) are given in Hertz.  Plant material. The seeds of Symphonia globulifera were collected in January 2002 at Fundong in the North-West province of Cameroon. The plant was identified by Dr G. Achoundong of the National Herbarium Yaoundé, Cameroon where a voucher specimen (N° 50787 NHC) has been deposited.   Extraction, isolation and characterization. The air-dried powdered seeds of S. globulifera (0.5 kg) were extracted with MeOH (2 L x 3) at room temperature and the extract concentrated to dryness to obtain a viscous residue (155 g). This residue was then subjected to flash chromatography with silica gel (230-400 mesh) as stationary phase eluting with a hexane/EtOAc system as mobile phase. 70 fractions of 300 mL each were collected and grouped on the basis of Symphonin: a new prenylated pyranoxanthone from the seeds of Symphonia globulifera Bull. Chem. Soc. Ethiop. 2004, 18(2) 179TLC analysis to yield three main series labelled A, B, and C. Fraction A contained only oils. Fraction B was concentrated to dryness and the residue subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh) eluting with a gradient of increasing polarity with hexane-EtOAc to afford 30 mg of sitosterol   and 100 mg of oleanolic acid (3). Chromatography of the fraction C led to more oleanolic acid (150 mg) and a mixture which was further subjected to repeated column chromatography to give 18 mg of symphonin (1) and 22 mg of guttiferone A (2). Known compounds were identified by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature [7, 14].  Symphonin (1).

Antimicrobial assay [13]. Extract and purified active principles (1 mg/mL) were tested against the micro-organisms, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli. The four strains of bacteria were cultivated in Mueller Hinton agar medium at 37 °C. After one day, their growth was assessed visually. The lowest concentration of the tested compounds in which no visible growth occurred was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration.
