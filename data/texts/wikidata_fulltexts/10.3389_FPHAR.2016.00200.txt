Isodon rugosus Wall. ex Benth. is extensively used as traditional medicine for the
management of various types of pain including tooth ache, gastric pain, abdominal
pain, ear ache, and generalized body pain. The current study is designed to scientifically
verify the purported uses of I. rugosus as analgesic agent and to figure out its possible
mechanism of action. Bioactive compounds responsible for analgesic activity were
identified using GC and GC-MS analysis. Analgesic potentials were evaluated using
acetic acid induced writhing, hot plate test, and formalin induced paw licking test. In
acetic acid induced writhing chloroform fraction (Ir.Chf) exhibited 53% analgesia while
formalin test displayed 61% inhibition at phase-I and 45% at phase-II respectively at
a dose of 100mg/kg. Similarly, in hot plate test Ir.Chf displayed average reaction time
of 7min at 15, 30, 45, and 60min intervals. The possible mechanism of action was
found to be the central pathway via opioidergic receptors as the mice showed morphine
like analgesic activity at pre-administration of naloxone (opioid antagonist) in hot plate
and formalin tests. In GC-MS analysis, 83 compounds were identified among which
eight compounds including benzyl alcohol, sebacic acid, myristic acid, phytol, sugiol,
Tocopherol, α-Amyrin, and stigmasterol were sorted out as previously reported analgesic
compounds. Current study revealed that analgesic potential of I. rugosus can attributed
to the presence of analgesic compounds. It may also be concluded that opioids receptors
are involved in the analgesic mechanism of I. rugosus due to effective antagonism of
nalaxone.
Keywords: Isodon rugosus, ethnomedicine, analgesia, nalaxone, opioidergic receptors, bioactive compounds
INTRODUCTION
The medicinal use of plants is an ancient tradition, far older than the current sciences of medicine
in developing countries. Several herbal remedies are now being intensively used in therapy for
different diseased conditions (Ullah F. et al., 2015; Ullah I. et al., 2015; Ayaz et al., 2016). The
use of medicinal plants as analgesic drugs in folk medicine is a practice common in developing
Zeb et al. Anti-nociceptive Investigations of Isodon rugosus Wall. ex Benth
countries, although in most cases the active principles of
the plants are unknown. According to the World Health
Organization over 75% of the world’s population still
depend on plant-derived medicines, usually obtained from
traditional healers, for its basic health-care needs (World Health
Organization, 1978). Worldwide about 85% of primary health
care medications depend on natural sources (Abbasi et al.,
2010). Till the nineteenth century, man has discovered the
great contribution of herbs in the management of almost every
pharmacological disorder (Plummer et al., 2001). According
to an estimation, up to 70,000 plant species are used ethno-
medicinally worldwide (Haq et al., 2012). According to a survey,
medicinal plants cover 34% of the total plant species found in
Pakistan (Sher H. et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2016). In Pakistan
at least 6000 flowering plants have been reported currently,
among which 400–600 are of great medicinal importance (Khan
and Khan, 2007). Numerous natural and synthetic compounds
have been verified to possess various pharmacological potentials
(Ayaz et al., 2015a,b; Kamal et al., 2015a; Sadiq et al., 2015;
Ahmad et al., 2016a; Khan et al., 2016). As far as the drugs in
the market are concerned, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) are among the most widely used medications due to
their efficacy for a wide range of pain, fever and inflammatory
conditions as well as cardiovascular protection. However, the
long-term administration of NSAIDmay induce gastro-intestinal
ulcers, bleeding, and renal disorders due to their nonselective
inhibition of both constitutive (COX-1) and inducible (COX-2)
isoforms of the cyclooxygenases enzymes (Halter et al., 2001).
It is believed that current pain killer drugs, such as opiates and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not useful
in all cases, because of their various serious side effects and low
potency. In this context, a research for other effective alternatives
agents is essential and beneficial to reduce the side effects and
to treat the concerned diseased condition in a rationalized
manner. In the past, search for latest pharmacologically active
compounds obtained from natural plants has led to the finding
of a number of clinically valuable medicines, such as morphine
and aspirin (Calixto et al., 2000; Gilani, 2005). Traditionally
in most of part of the world different plant species have been
used extensively in the form of paste, powder and decoction
for the killing the threshold of pain (Singh et al., 2011). Pain is
a condition which is related with every diseased condition but
the proper management to reduce or kill the pain in specific
health related issues without altering or worsening the side wise
diseases.
Isodon rugosusWall. ex Benth. belongs to the family Labiateae.
The bark of I. rugosus is used ethnomedicinally to treat dysentery
and to relieve generalized body pain (Shuaib and Khan, 2015).
Locally the dried leaves of this plant is put in mouth as remedy
for toothache (Akhtar et al., 2013). The extract of fresh leaves of
I. rugosus is applied over effected skin for immediate effect and
for earache 1−2 drops are used (Sabeen and Ahmad, 2009). It
has also been reported to be used ethnomedicinally for gastric
and abdominal pain (Ahmad et al., 2014).
Moreover, I. rugosus has been used traditionally in the
treatment of various infection, blood pressure, pyrexia,
rheumatism, microbial infection, and toothache (Khan and
Khatoon, 2007; Adnan et al., 2012; Shuaib et al., 2014).
This specie has also been verified scientifically to possess
pharmacological activities such as hyporglycaemic, anti-
diarrheal, and bronchodilator (Sher Z. et al., 2011; Ajmal et al.,
2012; Janbaz et al., 2014). Previously, we have reported the
preliminary phytochemical analysis and toxicological profile
of this plant. Moreover, we have also evaluated the crude
extract of this plant for acetyl and butyryl inhibitory and
antioxidant potentials which give a preliminary idea about
the use of this plant in neurological disorders (Zeb et al.,
2014a,b).
Based on the ethnomedicinal uses of I. rugosus, the current
investigation was undertaken to ascertain the analgesic effects
through in vivo evaluation of Ir.Chf and to identify its main
chemical constituents along with identification of bioactive
compounds and validation of its purported medicinal use. The
current study is also an attempt to figure out the mechanism
of analgesic effect due to suppression of central and peripheral
pathways or both.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Collection and Extraction
The fresh plant was collected from lower Dir (KPK), Pakistan in
the month of July and was identified by Dr. Ali Hazrat, plant
taxonomist at department of botany, Shaheed Benazir Bhuto
University Dir (KPK), Pakistan. The plant sample was kept at
the herbarium of the same university with voucher number
(1016AZ). Fresh aerial parts of the plant having weight (15 kg)
rinsed with uncontaminated water to remove any dust particles
and kept in shade for 22 days for drying purpose. The dried
plant parts were sliced into small pieces and grinded into coarse
powder with the help of a grinder. The powdered material (7 kg)
was macerated in 25 liters of 80% methanol for 20 days and
extraction withmethanol was repeated three times. After soaking,
it was filtered using muslin cloth and then through Whattman
filter paper. The filtrate obtained was evaporated using rotary
evaporator under reduced pressure at 40◦C (Ahmad et al., 2015;
Kamal et al., 2015b; Shah et al., 2015). The filtered solutions were
combined and concentrated under reduced pressure using rotary
evaporator. A greenish brown semi solid mass of the methanolic
extract was obtained having weighing 600 g.
Fractionation
The crude methanolic extract of I. rugosus was transferred into
a separating funnel and diluted with 500ml of distilled water
followed by the addition of n-hexane (500ml). The mixture was
shaken vigorously and kept for some time to form two layers. The
n-hexane layer was separated and repeated the same procedure
three times by the addition of 500ml of n-hexane each time.
All the n-hexane fractions were combined and concentrated at
reduced pressure using rotary evaporator. The final concentrated
weight of n-hexane fraction was 27 g. Same procedure was
repeated for chloroform, ethyl acetate getting 42, and 94 g
respectively and at the end the aqueous fraction was procured
weighing 135 g (Ayaz et al., 2014a,b).

Gas Chromatography (GC) Analysis
Chloroform fraction was analyzed by means of an Agilent USB-
393752 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA,
USA) withHHP-5MS 5% phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column
(30m × 0.25mm × 0.25µm film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte,
PA) equipped with an FID detector. The temperature of oven
was preserved at 70◦C for 1min at initially, and then gradually
increased to 180◦C at the speed of 6◦C/min for 5min and finally
increased to 280◦C at the speed of 5◦C/min for 20min. The
temperatures of the Injector and detector were set at 220◦C and
290◦C, correspondingly. Helium was utilized as carrier gas at a
flow rate of 1ml/min.
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) Analysis
GC/MS analysis of the chloroform fraction was processed by
means of an Agilent USB-393752 gas chromatograph (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a HHP-5MS 5%
phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column (30m × 0.25mm ×
0.25µm film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte, PA) prepared with
an Agilent HP-5973 mass selective detector in the electron
impact mode (Ionization energy: 70 ev) working under similar
experimental environment as illustrated for GC (Ayaz et al., 2015;
Ahmad et al., 2016b).
Identification of Components
Compounds present in chloroform fraction of I. rugosus were
identified based on the comparison of their relative retention
indices of each of them with those of authentic compounds in
the literature. Additional identification were performed from
the spectral data obtained from the Wiley and NIST libraries
and further identifications were completed by comparisons of
the fragmentation pattern of the mass spectra with the reported
literature (Stein et al., 2002; Adams, 2007).
Experimental Animals
The anti-nociceptive evaluation was carried out for which the
Swiss albino mice of either sex were obtained from the National
Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan. The experimental
animals were used with the approval of ethical committee of
Department of Pharmacy, University of Malakand, Pakistan
according to the animals Bye-Laws 2008 (Scientific procedure
Issue-I).
Acute Toxicity Test
Albino mice were arranged by dividing into control and
test groups each having 5 test models animals. Ir.Chf was
administered orally at various doses ranging from 250 to
2000mg/kg. The solvent used for dose preparation was tween-80.
After receiving the doses, themice were observed for next 72 h for
minor allergic symptoms and abnormal behavior (Hosseinzadeh
et al., 2000).
Analgesic Activity
Acetic Acid-Induced Writhing Test
The Acetic acid-induced writhing test was performed for the
evaluation of analgesic potential of I. rugosus. The Ir.Chf was
administered orally at various doses. After 30min, of interval
0.6% acetic acid (10ml/kg) was injected intra-peritoneal into the
test models (mice). Group I was administered 0.5% tween-80
(3ml/kg) which served as control, Group II was administered
standard drug diclofenac sodium (10mg/kg) while groups III
and IV were administered with Ir.Chf viz., 50 and 100mg/kg
respectively. The number of writhes (contractive movements
in the abdomen, twisting of the mice trunk, elongation and
extension of body and limbs) were counted from 5 to 30min after
the administration of acetic acid (Franzotti et al., 2000).
Formalin Test
Swiss albino mice 25–30 g were kept in a temperature controlled
environment 23 ± 2◦C with a 12 h light dark cycle. Food plus
water were freely available throughout the experiments. The
formalin-induced licking test was performed for the evaluation
of analgesic potential of I. rugosus. The Ir.Chf was administered
orally at various doses. After 30min, of interval 2.5% formalin
(20µl) (v/v in distilled water) was injected subcutaneously into
the plantar surface of the hind paw of the mice. Group I was
administered 0.5% tween-80 (3ml/kg) which served as negative
control, Group II was administered standard drug Morphine
(5mg/kg) while groups III and IV were administered with Ir.Chf
viz., 50 and 100mg/kg respectively. The formalin induced licking
of the paw was considered as indicative of the nociceptive
behavior. The total time spent in the behavioral responses to
nociception including licking and biting of injected paw was
recorded. The time spent was recorded up to 30min. The first
5min was considered as early phase (neurogenic phase) and
the second period of 15–30min as the late phase (inflammatory
phase) of the nociceptive response (Sulaiman et al., 2008).
Hot Plate Test
The heated surface of a hot plate (Ugo Basile, model-7280)
analgesia meter was maintained at 55 ± 0.2◦C. The hot plate
test was used to measure the response latencies according to
the reported procedure (Muhammad et al., 2012). Animals
were placed into the glass cylinder on the heated surface, and
the time between placement and licking of the hind paws or
jumping movements was recorded as response latency which
were the parameters evaluated as the thermal reactions. The
Ir.Chf (50 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) and morphine (5mg/kg, i.p.) were
administered 30min before the beginning of the experiment.
Mice were observed before and at 30, 60, and 90min after Ir.Chf
administration. The cut-off time was 20 s.
Involvement of Opioid Receptors
In order to verify the involvement of opioidergic system in
the Ir.Chf -induced antinociception, separated groups of mice
(n = 6) were pre-treated with non-selective opioid receptor
antagonist, naloxone (5mg/kg, S/C), which was injected 15min
before the administration of the Ir.Chf (100mg/kg; i.p.) and
morphine (5mg/kg), and tested using the hot plate and the
formalin test as mentioned above.

RESULTS
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy
(GC-MS)
The GC-MS analysis of Ir.Chf revealed the identification of
83 compounds. The compounds identified were having the
retention time of 3.666–54.438min. The area-wise highest
percentage was shown by ethyl palmitate with retention time
21.411min, followed by ethyl linoleate and benzenedicarboxylic
acid with retention time 27.633 and 36.423min. The list of all
compounds is given in Table 1 and the chromatogram has been
shown in Figure 1 in which the peaks are clearly visible. Similarly,
the Table 2 shows various parameters of major compounds
identified in Ir.Chf.
Acute Toxicity
Nomortality and behavioral change was recorded at the specified
doses during acute toxicity assay. So, the dose upto 2000mg/kg
was considered as safe for I. rugosus.
Writhing Test
The acetic acid induced writhing test for evaluation of analgesic
activity demonstrated a dose dependent activity. The mean
inhibition of writhes of positive control at the dose of 10mg/kg
was 16.5 ± 0.76 with 73.02% inhibition. The Ir.Chf exhibited
mean inhibition of 28.33 ± 0.55 with 53.67% inhibition at the
dose of 100mg/kg while at 10mg/kg it exhibited mean inhibition
of 39.83 ± 0.87 with 34.87% inhibition. The Ir.Chf showed
a comparative response (53.67%) with the positive control
(73.02%) at the dose of 100mg/kg as shown in the Table 3.
Formalin Test
Intraplantar injection of 2% formalin to the mice model evoked
a typical biphasic licking response. The duration of licking for
the early phase (0−5min) was recorded as 56.50 ± 0.76 s and
for the late phase (15−30min) was 78.83 ± 0.70 s in control
groups. As shown in Table 4, pre-treatment with different doses
(50 and 100mg/kg i.p.) of Ir.Chf had significant effect and
dose-dependent against the duration of licking activity in both
phases i.e., doses of 100mg/kg produced a marked reduction
of 61.36 and 45.88% inhibition of paw licking in the early
and late phase, respectively. Similarly, morphine (5mg/kg, i.p.)
exhibited marked potential in reduction both the neurogenic
pain (early phase, with inhibition of 84.95%) and inflammatory
pain (late phase, with inhibition 91.33%) in the formalin test.
The Morphine with naloxone exhibited 7.83% activity in the
early phase and 14.37% in the late phase. The Ir.Chf with
naloxone exhibited 12.99% pain reduction in the early phase
and 19.02% pain inhibition in the late phase. In the same
way, naloxone reversed significantly the antinociceptive effect of
Ir.Chf (100mg/kg) both in the early and late phase as those of
morphine.
Hot Plate Test
Results of hotplate test are summarized inTable 5. The Ir.Chf was
found to exhibit a dose dependent increase in latency time as that
of positive control. At initial 15min, the mean reaction time of
two different doses of Ir.Chf i.e., 50 and 100mg/kg body weight
was recorded as 5.28 ± 0.71 and 7.46 ± 0.59min respectively.
At the last interval i.e., 90min, the mean reaction time of two
different doses i.e., 50 and 100mg/kg body weight were recorded
as 4.56 ± 0.49 and 5.63 ± 0.30min respectively for Ir.Chf. The
reaction time at initial 15min for morphine at a dose of 5mg/kg
was recorded as 11.16 ± 0.94min and at 90min it was recorded
as 7.36± 0.94min. Similarly, at initial 15min, the mean reaction
time for Ir.Chf plus naloxone (50 + 1mg/kg body weight) was
figured out as 5.51± 0.60min. While at initial 15min, morphine
plus naloxone (5 + 1mg/kg body weight) the reaction time was
recorded as 4.76 ± 0.30min. There was observed an obvious
reduction in reaction time by the administration of naloxone
before the Ir.Chf.

Involvement of Opioid Receptors
It is obvious from the results that the Ir.Chf exhibited same
activity as that of morphine in both the test models i.e.,
the hot plate and the formalin. The effect of Ir.Chf was
effectively abolished by opioid antagonist (naloxone). In the
hot plate test the reaction time was considerably decreased by
the administration of naloxone and in the formalin test the
paw licking inhibition was effectively reversed by the naloxone,
which demonstrated the involvement of opioid receptors in the
analgesic pathway of Ir.Chf.
DISCUSSION
The current investigational study was carried out to evaluate the
antinociceptive effect of I. rugosus to verify the ethnomedicinal
claims. It was manifested on thermal nociception in hot plate test
and chemical nociception in the experimental models of acetic
acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced paw licking. The
selection of these models was made to investigate the central as
well as the peripheral mediated effect of plant sample (Ir.Chf).
It has been demonstrated previously that the acetic acid induced
writhing involves the peripheral pathway while the hot plate test
involves the central pathway in pain mediation. In the same way
the formalin test is believed to demonstrate the involvement of
both central and peripheral pathways. It has also been previously
postulated that acetic acid induce the release of endogenous
mediators i.e., prostaglandin E2 and F2α and lipoxygenase
products in the intraperitoneal fluids indirectly, which can trigger
nociceptive neurons in the proximity. The results of our current
investigational study generally suggests the involvement of both
central as well as peripheral pathway in the pain suppression as
at the dose of 100mg/kg, Ir.Chf exhibited 53% pain inhibition
in acetic acid induced writhing model, 61% activity in formalin
induced paw licking model and a wholesome analgesic effect
in hot plate model. The result also indicate that the specific
pathway involved in the pain suppression is opioidergic pathway,
which is depicted from the administration of opioid antagonist
(naloxone) to test animals before the administration of Ir.Chf.
It was analyzed for molecular characterization which resulted in
the identification of 83 different compounds. The compounds
identified were analyzed for the presence of bioactive analgesic
compounds by literature survey, which revealed the identification
of eight compounds viz., benzyl alcohol, sebacic acid, myristic
acid, phytol, sugiol, Tocopherol, α-Amyrin, and stigmasterol.
The structures of bioactive compounds have been depicted in
Figure 2. Briefly, Benzyl alcohol has been verified as an effective
local anesthetic. It has also been reported to decreases pain
associated with propofol injection (Wilson and Martin, 1999;
Minogue and Sun, 2005). Sebacic acid has been reported as an
excellent polymer in the case of various drugs formulation that
may be analgesics or anesthetics (Shikanov et al., 2007). Similary,
the virgin coconut oil has been reported for analgesic activity
containing 18.64% of Myristic acid (Intahphuak et al., 2010).
In same way, phytol also possess analgesic potential and has
been used for antinociception in vivo and in vitro in various
models (Santos et al., 2013). Likewise, the sugiol previously

isolated from Calocedrus formosana has also been reported for
anti-inflammatory activity (Chao et al., 2005). Tocopherol has
been reported to be used in neuropathic pain (Kim et al.,
2006). α-Amyrin has been verified for antinoception activity in
rat models (Pinto et al., 2008). The stigmasterol has also been
verified for its analgesic potential (Peres et al., 1998). We can
also compare the results of our current investigational study
with the previously reported data on I. rugosus, in which the tail
flick method was followed to figure out the analgesic potential
of this plant. In that test the tail deflection time for Ir.Chf and
positive control had been recorded as 9.35± 0.8 and 9.62± 0.2 s
respectively, which were almost parallel and comparative (Janbaz
et al., 2014). We can observe a similar correlation between the
positive control and Ir.Chf in the hot plate test of our current
investigational study which is obvious and summarized in
Table 4.
CONCLUSION
Based on the recorded results and the ethnomedicinal survey of
I. rugosus Wall. ex Benth. it may be inferred that this plant is a

potential source of analgesic compounds, which can produce its
analgesic effect due to central analgesic pathway and may be a
good candidate in the complementary and alternative medicine.
This study provides scientific justification for the ethnomedicinal
uses of this plant.
