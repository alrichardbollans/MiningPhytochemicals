B have been reported to be toxic, but scientific evidence 
for this claim is lacking.[2] Arylnaphthalide lignans are found 
in significant levels in plants of the genus Cleistanthus. 
Arylnaphthalide lignans include diphyllin, collinusin, 
cleistanthin, taiwanin, and other related compounds. The 
sugars/glycones of the glycosides are O‑methyl xylose and, 
to a lesser extent, d‑glucose and its O-methyl derivatives.[3] 
Diphyllin glycosides such as cleistanthin and cleistanthoside 
are also present in Cleistanthus patulus, Haplophyllum 
bucharicum, and Phyllanthus toxodiifolius.[3-5] P. toxodiifolius 
is commonly used as a diuretic agent in Thailand, and 
this plant contains various diphyllin glycosides, such as 
cleistanthin A, cleistanthoside A, and cleistanthin A methyl

AbSTRACT
To study the diuretic effects of cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B, phytoconstituents were isolated from the leaves 
of Cleistanthus collinus in Wistar rats. The in vivo diuretic effects of cleistanthins A and B were determined 
according to the Lipschitz test. Prior to the experiment, the animals were fasted for 5 h and placed individually in 
metabolic cages. Cleistanthins A and B (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) and furosemide (5 mg/kg) were suspended in 
0.5% w/v carboxymethyl cellulose and administered orally. The urine was collected up to 5 h after administration 
and subsequently up to 24 h after administration. The acidity and urine volume were measured immediately. 
The urinary sodium and potassium levels were determined using a flame photometer, and the chloride level was 
determined by argentometric titration. The diuretic index and diuretic activity were calculated mathematically. 
While cleistanthins A and B showed a diuretic index of more than one, the diuretic activity of these compounds 
was less than one, indicating inferior activity compared with furosemide. Both cleistanthin A and B produced a 
significant increase in the urine volume and alterations in urinary electrolyte levels. However, the effect of the 
compounds was not dose dependent. Cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B exert diuretic effects in male Wistar rats 
without affecting the urinary acidity.

Hence, this study was planned to determine the diuretic 
effects of cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B in Wistar rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant material
Taxonomically identified C. collinus (Roxb.) (Euphorbiaceae) 
plant parts were collected in Pondicherry and in rural parts 
of Villupuram and Cuddalore districts of Tamil Nadu, 
India. They were identified and certified by the Botanical 
Survey of India (BSI), Coimbatore (BSI/SC/5/23/08-09/
Tech.241). Leaves of C. collinus were collected during 
February–April every year. A voucher specimen of 
the plant is kept in the Department of Pharmacology, 
Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education 
and Research (JIPMER), for further reference.
Chemicals
An activated neutral alumina (column  chromatography 
grade) was purchased from Spectrum Reagents and 
Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., Cochin, India, and Sisco Research 
Laboratory Ltd., Mumbai, India. Silica gel-G for thin 
layer chromatography (TLC) was purchased from Sisco 
Research Laboratory Ltd. Furosemide was purchased 
from Sanofi Aventis, India (Tablet Lasix 40 mg). All other 
solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade, and were 
purchased from Sisco Research Laboratory Ltd. and Merck 
Chemicals, India.
Animals
Healthy adult male Wistar rats (180–200 g) of inbred 
colony strains were used in the study. The animals were 
obtained from the Central Animal House, JIPMER, and 
allowed to adapt to the laboratory conditions for a period 
of 1 week. All the experimental animals were housed at 
a temperature of 25 ± 2°C and 40–50% humidity in a 
12:12 ± 1 h light–dark cycle. The rats were fed with standard 
rat pellets (VRK Nutritional Solution, Sangli, Maharastra) 
and water ad libitum. The study protocol was approved by 
the Institute Animals Ethics Committee (IAEC), and all the 
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the 
guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of control and 
supervision of experiments on animals (CPCSEA), India.
Isolation of cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B
Cleistanthins A and and B were isolated from the leaves of 
the C. collinus plant. An extract was obtained from defatted 
powered leaves of this plant using acetone. The acetone 
extract was used for isolation of cleistanthins A and B 
through column chromatography. The acetone extract 
was dissolved in benzene, passed through the neutral 
alumina column and eluted with benzene, benzene: ethyl 
acetate (4:1), benzene: ethyl acetate (1:1), and methanol: 
chloroform (9.5:0.5) to isolate the fatty alcohol, collinusin, 
cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B fractions, respectively.[6,7] 
The fractions of cleistanthins A and B were purified using 
preparative thin layer chromatography and crystallization 
method, respectively. The functional groups and facial 
arrangement of atoms in cleistanthin A and B molecules 
were confirmed by FT‑IR spectroscopy (Avatar FT‑IR 
330) and nuclear magnetic resonance (Bruker 300 MHz) 
spectroscopy.[8]
Dose calculation for cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B
The dose of cleistanthins A and B was determined 
according to the OECD guidelines (new OECD Test 
Guideline 420, 421)[9] using the fixed dose method. Female 
Swiss albino mice weighing 20–25 g were used for the 
study. Cleistanthin A and B were administered successively 
in different groups at fixed dose levels of 5, 50, 300, 1000, 
and 1200 mg/kg and observed for a specified period. Three 
mice in a group were used per dose and closely observed 
for 24 h and monitored for 14 days to record the general 
behavior and mortality.[10]
Determination of  renal effect of  cleistanthin A and 
cleistanthin B
Diuretic activity of cleistanthins A and B were determined 
according to the Lipschitz test. Healthy male Wistar rats 
(180–200 g) were used for the study. The animals were 
divided into eight groups of six animals each and treated 
as follows:
Group I  : Control
Group II  :   Standard drug treatment (furosemide, 
5 mg/kg)
Group III  : Cleistanthin A, 12.5 mg/kg
Group IV  : Cleistanthin A, 25 mg/kg
Group V  : Cleistanthin A, 50 mg/kg
Group VI  : Cleistanthin B, 12.5 mg/kg
Group VII  : Cleistanthin B, 25 mg/kg
Group VIII : Cleistanthin B, 50 mg/kg
Five hours prior to the experiment, food and water were 
withdrawn, and the animals were housed individually 
in metabolic cages. cleistanthins A and B at various 
concentrations (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) and the reference 
standard, furosemide (5 mg/kg), were suspended in 0.5% Journal of Young Pharmacists Vol 4 / No 2  75

w/v carboxymethyl cellulose and administered orally in a 
single dose. Additionally, 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution per 
100 g body weight was given by oral gavage. Urine was 
collected continuously up to 5 h after dosing and from 
then up to 24 h after dosing, and the urine volume and 
acidity (pH) were measured immediately after collection. 
The urinary electrolyte contents were analyzed within 24 h 
of collection. The urinary sodium and potassium levels 
were determined by flame photometry, and the chloride 
level was determined by argentometric titration.[11-13] The 
diuretic action/index and diuretic activity were calculated 
mathematically as follows:[14]

Statistical analysis
The mean±SEM values were calculated for each parameter. 
Since the variation within a group was large, the values 
of each parameter were log transformed to carry out 
statistical analysis. Significant differences between the 
groups were determined using one-way ANOVA followed 
by a Bonferroni comparison of the groups. A P value less 
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
There was clear TLC separation of cleistanthin at a Rf 
value of 0.37–0.42. The purified cleistanthin A and 
B were identified using UV‑visible, FT‑IR, and NMR 
spectroscopy. The percentage yield of isolated cleistanthin 
A and cleistanthin B were 0.9–1.0% w/w and 0.6–0.8% 
w/w, receptively. The single oral dose of cleistanthin A 
and B up to 800 mg/kg did not lead to mortality, but these 
compounds caused death in 50% of the animals at 1200 and 
1000 mg/kg, respectively. Based on the dose determination 
study results, less than 1/10 of the toxic dose was selected 
for pharmacological evaluation.
The effects of  cleistanthins A and B on urine volume 
and urinary electrolytes are presented in Tables 1 and 2. 
Cleistanthin A, cleistanthin B and furosemide produced 
a significant increase in the urine volume from 5 to 24 h 
though the test compounds did not cause a significant 
increase in the urine volume during the first 5 h. Cleistanthin 
A, cleistanthin B and furosemide caused an increase in 
the urinary sodium and potassium levels in the first 5 h 
(P<0.01), but no changes in the levels were observed with 
urinary sodium from 5 to 24 h. The potassium levels in 
the urine were comparable in the control and furosemide 
groups from 5 to 24 h, but cleistanthin A reduced the 
potassium level while cleistanthin B increased excretion of 
potassium in urine. Neither of the test compounds altered 
the pH value of the urine and the chloride excretion in 
comparison with the control group.

Parasuraman and Raveendran: Diuretic effects of cleistanthin A and B
The calculated diuretic index and diuretic activity values 
are presented in Table 3. The diuretic index and diuretic 
activity of both cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B are less 
than those of furosemide.
DISCUSSION
The fixed dose method of safety dose determination 
shows that cleistanthin A and B are safe up to 800 mg/kg. 
Cleistanthin A and B caused 50% mortality at 1200 and 
1000 mg/kg, respectively. Cleistanthins A and B belong 
to class 4 (slightly toxic) of Hodge and Sterner toxicity 
Scale.[15]
The results of this study show that cleistanthins A and B 
have diuretic effects. Both the compounds significantly 
increase the urine volume between 5 and 24 h after 
administration but not up to 5 h after administration. 
This suggests a delayed action of the compounds, in 
contrast to furosemide, which acts within a relatively short 
time. In spite of a significant increase in the excretion of 
urinary electrolytes such as sodium and potassium during 
the period from 0 to 5 h after administration, there is no 
corresponding increase in the urine volume in comparison 
with control animals. Almost all diuretics increase the 
excretion of sodium and potassium, the exception being 
potassium‑sparing diuretics, which increase the excretion 
of sodium but conserve potassium. It is difficult to offer 
an explanation as to why the urine volume in animals 
treated with cleistanthins A and B did not show an increase 
corresponding with the increased excretion of electrolytes. 
It could be inferred that the action of the test compounds 
starts late in the first 5 h after administration and continues 
5–24 h after administration. The urine volume starts 
increasing, but it does not reach a statistically significant 
level before 5 h. During the 5–24 h period, the increase 
in urine excretion continues to become significant, but 
the urinary electrolyte levels are not different in the urine 
of the control animals and in that of those treated with 
the compounds. This could be due to compensatory 
mechanisms that come into action in the later part of the 
period from 5 to 24 h, after the action of the compounds 
is over. Hence there is no difference in the electrolyte 
levels of the treated and control groups. The increase in 
the urinary flow during the period from 5 to 24 h could 
have mainly occurred in the initial part of that period. The 
electrolyte values in the control group differ during 0–5 
and 5–24 h. This could be due to salt loading leading to 
dilution of electrolytes in 0–5 h and hence the electrolyte 
levels, especially sodium and chloride, appear to be excreted 
more during 5–24 h.
In the period from 5 to 24 h, there is no change in the 
urinary sodium level with administration of cleistanthin A 
and B. However, cleistanthin A reduces the potassium 
level in the urine while cleistanthin B increases the same. 
In spite of these conflicting effects of the compounds 
on the electrolytes, the urine volume of the period from 
5 to 24 h is significantly increased. Both the compounds 
raise the potassium levels in the urine in the first 5 h, 
but in the period from 5 to 24 h, while cleistanthin A 
conserves potassium, cleistanthin B continues to increase 
the potassium excretion. Probably the initial increase in 
potassium excretion triggers a compensatory mechanism 
later in the case of cleistanthin A. However, why such a 
compensation does not take place with cleistanthin B is 
unexplainable. We are not able to explain the turnaround 
of urinary potassium that occurs with cleistanthin A.
The chloride level and pH value are not influenced by the 
test compounds. The use of a C. collinus leaf extract is 
reported to have reduced the urinary pH value.[16] Since the 
leaves of C. collinus contain more than 30 compounds, it is 
possible that the reduction in pH was due to one or more 
compounds other than cleistanthins A and B. Although 
the compounds exert a diuretic activity as indicated by the 
diuretic index being greater than one, the extent of the 
effect is not comparable with that of  furosemide.[11]
Metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia 
are reported to be induced by C. collinus poisoning in   
humans.[17] In one study, C. collinus poisoning caused 
metabolic acidosis in all patients, hypokalemia in 60% 
of the patients, and renal failure in 15.6% of  them.[18]
The leaf extract of C. collinus produced type I distal renal 
tubular acidosis and type II respiratory failure in preclinical 
evaluations, and it was suggested that these changes are 
due to a decrease in the pH value of the urine, a failure of 
the acid-secreting mechanism and a decrease in the blood 
potassium levels.[16] In this study, no changes in urinary 
pH value (acidity) were observed with either cleistanthin

Parasuraman and Raveendran: Diuretic effects of cleistanthin A and B
A or cleistanthin B. As discussed earlier, one or more 
compounds other than cleistanthin A or cleistanthin B 
present in the leaf extract may be responsible for the 
acidosis and other effects on the kidneys.
Several plants belonging to the Euphorbiaceae, including 
P. toxodiifolius, have been used in Thai folk medicine to induce 
diuresis. P. toxodiifolius is one of the sources of cleistanthin A, 
cleistanthoside A, and cleistanthin A methyl ether. This offers 
support to our finding that cleistanthin A is a diuretic.
In this study, no attempt was made to elucidate the 
mechanism of the diuresis induced by cleistanthins A and 
B. Useful information would have been obtained if the 
urine output was measured hourly rather than at 0-5 h and 
at 5-24 h. This would have revealed the time at which the 
action of the test compounds starts and the time at which 
it ends. Since the hourly output of urine in the rats was too 
small to carry out the analysis with the existing facilities, it 
was not possible to perform such a study.
In summary, this study explains the diuretic effects of 
cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B, phytoconstituents isolated 
from the leaves of C. collinus. Although the compounds 
have diuretic activity, the effects are not comparable 
with that of furosemide.
