Abstract
Background: Alpinia katsumadai (AK) extracts and fractions were tested for in vitro antiviral activities against
influenza virus type A, specially human A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and avian A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2), by means of
time-of-addition experiments; pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post treatment.
Results: In pre-treatment assay, the AK extracts and AK fractions did not show significant antiviral activity. During
the simultaneous treatment assay, one AK extract and five AK fractions designated as AK-1 to AK-3, AK-5, AK-10,
and AK-11 showed complete inhibition of virus infectivity against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2). The 50% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC50) of these one AK extracts and five AK fractions with
exception of the AK-9 were from 0.8 ± 1.4 to 16.4 ± 4.5 μg/mL against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The two AK extracts and
three AK fractions had EC50 values ranging from <0.39 ± 0.4 to 2.3 ± 3.6 μg/mL against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2). By the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the two AK extracts and five AK fractions completely
inhibited viral adsorption onto chicken RBCs at less than 100 μg/mL against both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/
Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2). Interestingly, only AK-3 was found with inhibition for both viral attachment and
viral replication after showing extended antiviral activity during the post treatment assay and quantitative real-time
PCR.
Conclusions: These results suggest that AK extracts and fractions had strong anti-influenza virus activity that can
inhibit viral attachment and/or viral replication, and may be used as viral prophylaxis.
Background
Influenza viruses are enveloped RNA viruses that belong
to the family Orthomyxoviridae, including influenza
viruses A, B, and C, and two other genera [1,2].
The viruses are responsible for seasonal flu epidemic and
caused acute contagious respiratory infection. Particularly,
young children, the old, and patients with chronic diseases
are at high risk to develop severe complications of influ-
enza virus infection that lead to high mortality rates [3,4].
Among the five genera, type A viruses are the most viru-
lent human pathogen which have caused three pandemics
in the 20
th century and are known to be transmitted to
other species [1,2]. More recently, the human influenza
outbreak of the swine-origin A/H1N1 strain in 2009 has
become a serious public concern around the world [5,6].
Up to present, there are only four antiviral agents,
approved by the FDA to treat influenza virus infection
and these can be divided into two groups. The group
comprising of amantadine and rimantadine block the M2
ion channel, which is essential for viral proliferation,
thereby interfering with viral uncoating inside cells. The
group of zanamivir and oseltamivir inhibit viral neurami-
nidase which plays an important role in viral release
[1,7]. The M2 inhibitors are effective only against influ-
enza virus A and are associated with several toxic effects
in the digestive and autonomic nervous systems, as well
as with the emergence of drug-resistant variants through-
out the 40 years of its use [8]. Although zanamivir and

of zanamivir is low and it is excreted rapidly by the kid-
neys. Nausea and vomiting are frequent among adults
receiving oseltamivir [9,10]. Besides these two major
groups of anti-influenza drugs, several other approaches
including inhibition of viral RNA transcription (RNA
polymerase), small interfering RNA, inhibition of virus-
cell fusion and proteolytic processing of hemagglutinin
(HA) are existing; however, all of these alternative meth-
ods has not yet been licensed [7,11]. Hence, the need for
a new drug and their market are greatly emphasized.
Alpinia katsumadai Hayata (Zingiberaceae) (AK) has
been utilized as a traditional Chinese herbal drug for an
anti-emetic and stomachic [12]. It has been reported to
contain a variety of diarylheptanoids, monoterpenes, ses-
quiterpenoid, flavonoids, and chalcones as major consti-
tuents [13-15]. Recently, compounds isolated from
A. katsumadai showed in vitro neuraminidase inhibitory
activities against human influenza virus A/PR/8/34 of
subtype H1N1 and antiviral effects in plaque reduction
assays of the four H1N1 swine influenza viruses [16].
However, the antiviral mechanisms of AK is not clear.
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the in vitro
anti-influenza viral mechanism of AK extracts and AK
fractions using time-of-addition and hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) assays.
Methods
Preparation of Alpinia katsumadai extracts and fractions
The dried seeds (4.8 kg) of AK were ground and macer-
ated with ethanol (1.5 L × 20) for one week at room
temperature, and then filtered and the clarified solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the
ethanol extract (289 g, AK-1). The combined ethanol
extract was dissolved in 2.0 L of a mixture of water and
ethanol (1:9) and successively partitioned with EtOAc
and water, yielding an EtOAc fraction (192 g, AK-2) and
water fraction (70 g, AK-3). Then, the water soluble
fraction AK-3 was subjected to diaion (HP-20) column
chromatography, eluted with MeOH in water in a step-
gradient manner from 20% to 100% to make five frac-
tions [20% methanol (AK-4): 3.9 g, 40% methanol
(AK-5): 11.9 g, 60% methanol (AK-6): 32.7 g, 80%
methanol (AK-7): 3.8 g, and 100% methanol (AK-8): 1.1
g]. To obtain polysaccharide fraction, we reexamined
another procedure. The dried and pulverized seeds of
AK (600 g) were mixed with 1.5 L of water and shaken
at 80°C for 12 h. The water extract (98 g, AK-9) was fil-
tered through a filter paper to remove debris, and then
the solution was precipitated by the addition of ethanol
in 1:4 ratio (v/v) at room temperature. After overnight
precipitation, the precipitate was collected by centrifuga-
tion (12,000 rpm, 30 min at 4°C) and washed with acet-
one and freeze-dried. This fractionation procedure was
repeated three times. The corresponding fraction (56 g,
AK-10) was light brown powder (polysaccharide frac-
tion). The remained supernatant was concentrated in a
rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, yielding a
supernatant fraction (28 g, AK-11).

obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC CCL-3; Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in
Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The influenza
strains A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (ATCC VR-1469) and A/
Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) were propagated in
MDCK cells in the presence of 10 μg/mL trypsin (1:250;
GIBCO Invitrogen Corporation, California).
Cytotoxicity
MDCK cells were grown in 96 well plates at 1 × 10
5
cells/well for 24 h. The media in plates were replaced
with media containing serially diluted extracts and incu-
bated for 72 h. The solution was replaced with only
media and 5 μL MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl]-
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
solution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C
for 4 h. The supernatant was removed, and 100 μL0 . 0 4
M HCl-isopropanol was added to dissolve formazan
crystals. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm with sub-
traction of the background measurement at 655 nm in a
microplate reader. The 50% cytotoxic concentration
(CC50) was calculated by regression analysis.

Before virus inoculation, non cytotoxic concentration
(≤ CC50) of AK extracts were added to the cells and
incubated for 12 h. Then two AK extracts and five AK
fractions were removed and the MDCK cells were
washed 2 times with PBS. Influenza virus at 100 TCID50
(tissue culture infectious dose) were inoculated onto the
MDCK cells for 1 h with occasional rocking. The virus
was removed and the cells replaced with EMEM con-
taining 10 μg/mL trypsin. The cultures were incubated

under 5% CO2 atmosphere until the cells in the infected,
untreated control well showed complete CPE as
observed by light microscopy. Each concentration of
two AK extracts and five AK fractions was assayed in
triplicate.
Post treatment assay (Figure 1C): Influenza virus at
100 TCID50 were inoculated onto near confluent
MDCK cell monolayers (1 × 10
5 cells/well) for 1 h with
occasional rocking. The media was removed and
replaced by EMEM containing 10 μg/mL trypsin and
several two AK extracts and five AK fractions at differ-
ent concentrations. The cultures were incubated for
72 h at 35°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere until the cells
in the infected, untreated control well showed complete
viral CPE as observed by light microscopy. The two AK
extracts and five AK fractions were assayed for virus
inhibition in triplicate.
After 72 h incubation in all antiviral assays, 0.034%
neutral red was added to each well and incubated for
2 h at 35°C in the dark. The neutral red solution was
removed and the cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4).
Destaining solution (containing 1% glacial acetic acid,
49% H2O, and 50% ethanol) was added to each well.
The plates were incubated in the dark for 15 min at
room temperature. Absorbance was read at 540 nm
using a microplate reader.
Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay
The hemagglutination inhibition assay was performed to
evaluate the effects of two AK extracts and five AK frac-
tions on viral adsorption to target cells. Standardized
chicken red blood cell (cRBC) solutions were prepared
according to the WHO manual 2002 (WHO, 2002). The
influenza virus solution (4 HAU/25 μL) was mixed with
an equal volume of AK extracts (25 μL) in a two-fold serial
dilution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4°C. Fifty μLo ft h e
solution was mixed with an equal volume of a 1% cRBC
suspension and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Reverse Transcription and quantitative real-time PCR
MDCK cells were grown to about 90% confluence,
infected with influenza virus at 0.01 MOI, and cultured in
t h ep r e s e n c eo fA K - 3( 2 0μg/mL) or tamiflu (10 μM).
Medium was removed after 3 h and 18 h. Cells were
scraped off, washed twice with PBS, and collected by cen-
trifugation (500 g for 3 min). In order to determine the
expression level of Matrix (M) gene mRNA of influenza
virus, total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini
kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
The primer sequences used for quantitative real-time
PCR of viral RNA were 5’-CTTCTAACCGAGGTC-
GAAAC GTA-3’ (sense) and 5’- GGTGACAGGATTG
GTCTTGTCTTTA-3’ (antisense) [17]. The GAPDH was
used as internal control of cellular RNAs, with primer
sequences of 5’-CAACGGATTTGGCCGTATTGG-3’
(sense) and Reverse: 5’- TGAAGGGGTCATTGAT
GGCG-3 (antisense).
The total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA master mix
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Reverse transcription was performed at 42°C
for 1 h. The enzyme was inactivated at 95°C for 5 min.
The cDNA was stored at -20°C or directly used in quan-
titative real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was conducted
using 2 μL of cDNA and Power SYBR Green PCR 2 X
master mix (Applied Biosystems). Cycling conditions for

by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 15 s. Real-
time PCR was conducted using the Step One Plus Real-
time PCR system, and the data were analyzed with
StepOne software v2.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Neuraminidase (recombinant influenza A virus, rvH1N1)
inhibition assay
The neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay was conducted
using recombinant NA deduced from the 1918 Spanish
flu virus (A/Bervig_Mission/1/18 [H1N1]). NA inhibition
activities were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immuno-
sorbent Assay (ELISA). All samples were dissolved in
MeOH at 5 mM and diluted. Fifty μLo fs u b s t r a t e ,
800 μM 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic
acid sodium salt hydrate solution, was mixed with 80 μL
of 50 mM Tris buffer (containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 200
mM NaCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature. Twenty μL
of the sample solution and 50 μLo fN A( 0 . 0 5p g / m Li n
the same Tris buffer) were added to a well in a plate.
The mixture was recorded at excitation and emission
wavelengths of 365 nm and 445 nm. The inhibition ratio
was obtained using the equation:
Activity(%) [( ) /( ] =− −× SS CC 00 100
Where C is the fluorescence of the control (enzyme,
buffer, and substrate) after 20 min of incubation, C0 is
the fluorescence of the control at zero time, S is the
fluorescence of the tested samples (enzyme, sample
solution, and substrate) after incubation, and S0 is the
fluorescence of the tested samples at zero time. To
allow for the quenching effect of the samples, the sam-
ple solution was added to the reaction mixture C,a n d
any reductions in fluorescence were assessed.
Results
Cytotoxicity of Alpinia katsumadai extracts in MDCK cells
The cytotoxicity of two AK extracts and five AK fractions
was evaluated by the MTT assay for 50% cytotoxic con-
centration (CC50). Confluent MDCK cells were incubated
with EMEM media in the absence or presence of two-fold
diluted AK extracts (0.39-200 μg / m L )f o r7 2h ,a n dt h e
MTT reagents were treated onto the cells. CC50 values of
AK-1, AK-2, and AK-3 showed 8.9-27.1 μg/mL. CC50
values of AK-5, AK-9, AK-10, and AK-11 showed 92.3-
over 200 μg/mL (Table 1). Hence, experiments to evaluate
the antiviral effect were carried out at AK extracts and AK
fractions concentration below CC50 in this study.
Inhibitory activity of Alpinia katsumadai on influenza virus
binding to cell receptors
In order to test the ability of the two AK extracts and five
AK fractions in preventing the attachment of influenza
virus to MDCK cells, we used and analyzed the pre-
treatment and simultaneous treatment assays. In the pre-
treatment assay, AK extracts and AK fractions were
treated the MDCK cells and incubated for 12 h before
virus infection. Cells were infected with virus and incu-
bated for 72 h at 35°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. The
results showed that antiviral effects against A/PR/8/34
(H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) were less
than 50% inhibition in pre-treatment assay. (Figure 2). In
the simultaneous treatment assay, after various concentra-
tions of AK extracts or AK fractions and A/PR/8/34
(H1N1) or A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) were
mixed, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Confluent MDCK
cells were inoculated with the mixture for 1 h. Then, the
mixture removed and cells replced with media and were
incubated 72 h at 35 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. We
found that AK-1 to AK-3 (EtOH extract, EtOAc fraction,
H2O fraction), AK-5 (40% methanol fraction), AK-10
(polysaccharide fraction), and AK-11 (supernatant frac-
tion) exhibited inhibitory activities against A/PR/8/34
(H1N1) with EC50 values ranging from 0.8 ± 1.4 to 16.4 ±
4.5 μg/mL (Table 1). Against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2), the two AK extracts and five AK fractions (AK-1
to AK-3, AK-5, and AK-9 to AK-11) inhibited virus infec-
tion with EC50 values ranging from <0.39 ± 0.4 to 2.3 ±
3.6 μg/mL (Table 1). One AK extract and five AK fractions
(AK-1 to AK-3, AK-5, AK-10, and AK-11) inhibited both
A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2) influenza virus infection in MDCK cells. Interest-
ingly, A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) strain
was inhibited strongly demonstrating SI values of 45.2,
55.9, > 95.2 and 71.1 in A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2) by AK-1, AK-3, AK-5 and AK-10 extracts, respec-
tively (Table 1). Significantly, AK-5 showed the best inhi-
bitory effect in the both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/
Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2).
Hemagglutination inhibition activity
The simultaneous treatment assay results indicated that
treatment with AK extracts and AK fractions on virus
entry completely abrogated virus infectivity. Hence, we
evaluated whether AK extracts inhibit hemagglutination
by influenza virus. The two AK extracts and five AK frac-
tions completely inhibited viral attachment onto cRBCs in
both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2) at less than 100 μg/mL (Figure 3). The two AK
extracts and five AK fractions showed a decreasing order

(H9N2). Among them, AK-1, AK-3, and AK-5 particularly
showed strong inhibition of HA with 1.04 ± 0.3 to 3.64 ±
1.4 μg/mL against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and 1.56 ± 0.3 to
9.37 ± 3.1 μg/mL against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2). Results demonstrated strong interaction of AK
extracts and AK fractions with hemagglutinin on the
outer-layer proteins of influenza virus causing the block-
age of viral attachment.
Inhibitory activity of Alpinia katsumadai on influenza virus
replication
The post treatment assay was performed to evaluate
whether the two AK extracts and five AK fractions are
able to inhibit replication of influenza virus A/PR/8/34
(H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) in
MDCK cells. Two AK extracts and three AK fractions
except AK-3 were showed no inhibitory effects against
influenza viruses in the post treatment assay. However,
AK-3 demonstrated a dose dependant antiviral activity
against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and an effective antiviral
activity against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) at
concentration below 12.5 μg/mL (Figure 4). Similarly in
simultaneous assay, AK-3 showed a stronger antiviral
effect against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) than
against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1).
As influenza viral RNA synthesized in early and late-
stage, their syntheses were compared between drug-

with 1% cRBC for 1 h at room temperature. We determined the minimum concentration of AK extracts and AK fractions inhibiting the viral
hemagglutination completely.

tion was performed at 3 h and 18 h after influenza virus
infection and the levels of intracellular influenza RNA
were measured. Quantitative real-time PCR showed a
reduction of influenza RNA from the AK-3 (20 μg/mL)
treated cells comparison with the non-treated cells (05.%
DMSO) in both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/
Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) (Figure 5). Specially, influenza
viral RNA inhibition of AK-3 (20 μg/mL) treated cells
showed a stronger in late stage than in early stage. These
results indicate that AK-3 exerts antiviral effects by two
mechanisms, blockage of viral attachment and virus
replication.
Neuraminidase inhibition activity
The biological activities of the two AK extracts and five
AK fractions were assessed against NAs from recombi-
nant influenza virus A (rvH1N1). We found that the IC50
values of the two AK extracts and four AK fractions
except AK-11 ranged from 13.2 to 153.1 μg/mL against
rvH1N1 NA (Table 2) and these were dose-dependent,
respectively.
Discussion
The influenza virus replication cycle can be divided into 5
steps: 1) binding of viral HA to sialic acid (SA) receptor on
host cell surface (adsorption step), 2) internalization of
virus by receptor-mediated endocytosis and fusion of viral
HA2 with endosomal membranes triggered by influx of
protons through M2 channel (endocytosis and fusion
step), 3) release of viral genes into the cytoplasm (uncoat-
ing step), 4) packaging of viral proteins with viral genes
after viral RNA replication, transcription and translation,
and budding of new viruses (packaging and budding step),

Page 7 of 9AK has been reported to inhibit the release of new viruses
via putative interaction in the NA binding site on human
influenza virus A/PR/8/34 of subtype H1N1 and four
H1N1 swine influenza viruses [16]. However, this informa-
tion is still limited to elucidate the antiviral mechanisms of
AK. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the antiviral effect
of AK extracts and AK fractions works in two ways: 1)
blockage of viral binding to cell receptor, and 2) inhibition
of viral replication after entry. To determine the stage at
which AK extracts and AK fractions exhibit inhibitory
activities, time-of-addition assays at three distinct time
points: 12 h prior to infection (pre-treatment), time after
incubation and before virus infection (simultaneous treat-
ment), and 1 h after virus entry (post treatment), were
performed.
The time-of-addition assays during the pre-treatment
and simultaneous treatment were used to identify which
extracts block the viral adsorption to cells. The pre-
treatment assay did not show significant antiviral activity
(Figure 2). AK-3 and AK-11 showed a weak inhibitory
effect of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) only. In simultaneous treat-
ment assay, two AK extracts and five AK fractions
completely abrogated virus infectivity by lowering the con-
centration of both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/
Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2). AK-9 (H2Oe x t r a c t )s h o w e da n t i -
viral effect against A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2)
only. These data suggest that two AK extracts and five AK
fractions may directly interfere with viral envelope protein
and not with the SA receptor at the cell surface. Therefore,
we used HI assays to determine whether the two AK
extracts and five AK fractions interacted with HA of influ-
enza virus. Two AK extracts and five AK fractions exhib-
ited complete inhibition of viral HA in both A/PR/8/34
(H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2), which
agrees with the simultaneous treatment assay results.
Overall, we strongly suggest that AK extracts and AK frac-
tions could develop potent antiviral drug candidate via
inhibition of viral HA protein.
To evaluate the anti-influenza activity after virus infec-
tion, we employed the post treatment assay and quanti-
tative real-time RCR to test the in vitro effect of these
extracts and fractions on viral replication. Grienke et al.
[16] reported about the AK fractions of dichloro-
methane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol inhibited NA pro-
tein. Therefore, we evaluated NA inhibition assay and
confirmed that two AK extracts and four AK fractions
except AK-11 inhibited NA protein of rvH1N1. We
found that only AK-3 inhibited influenza virus infection
suggesting two possible ways of viral inhibitions, 1)
blockage of viral attachment by inhibition of viral HA
protein, 2) blockage of viral replication and/or release
by inhibition of NA. Interestingly, AK-3 showed greater
inhibition of viral attachment than of replication, against
both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96
(H9N2). However, the other two AK extracts and four
AK fractions showed only blockage of viral attachment
of influenza virus to the cell.
Conclusions
This study has shown that AK extracts and AK fractions
can inhibit both A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/
Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) influenza viruses by inhibiting
viral HA binding to the SA receptors in the host cell.
AK-3 offers a potential antiviral drug candidate by inhi-
biting viral attachment step, replication and release step.
These results lead to further investigation about charac-
terization of active compounds and their specific
mechanism against influenza virus.
