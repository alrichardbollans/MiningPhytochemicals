Abstract
Background: The crude extract of the fruit bearing plant, Physalis peruviana (golden berry), demonstrated anti-
hepatoma and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the cellular mechanism involved in this process is still unknown.
Methods: Herein, we isolated the main pure compound, 4b-Hydroxywithanolide (4bHWE) derived from golden
berries, and investigated its antiproliferative effect on a human lung cancer cell line (H1299) using survival, cell
cycle, and apoptosis analyses. An alkaline comet-nuclear extract (NE) assay was used to evaluate the DNA damage
due to the drug.
Results: It was shown that DNA damage was significantly induced by 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL 4bHWE for 2 h in a
dose-dependent manner (p < 0.005). A trypan blue exclusion assay showed that the proliferation of cells was
inhibited by 4bHWE in both dose- and time-dependent manners (p < 0.05 and 0.001 for 24 and 48 h, respectively).
The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50)o f4 bHWE in H1299 cells for 24 and 48 h were 0.6 and 0.71 μg/
mL, respectively, suggesting it could be a potential therapeutic agent against lung cancer. In a flow cytometric
analysis, 4bHWE produced cell cycle perturbation in the form of sub-G1 accumulation and slight arrest at the G2/M
phase with 1 μg/mL for 12 and 24 h, respectively. Using flow cytometric and annexin V/propidium iodide
immunofluorescence double-staining techniques, these phenomena were proven to be apoptosis and complete
G2/M arrest for H1299 cells treated with 5 μg/mL for 24 h.
Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated that golden berry-derived 4bHWE is a potential DNA-damaging and
chemotherapeutic agent against lung cancer.
Background
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the US
[1] and other countries. Many therapies for lung cancer
such as radiotherapy [2], docetaxel [3], the combination
of carboplatin and paclitaxel [4], and others were devel-
oped; however, drug development for lung cancer is still
challenging.
Dietary chemoprevention using fruits and foods [5-7]
as a practical, economical, and effective approach in
reducing the risk of many cancers was reviewed [8-11].
Protection against lung cancer by a higher dietary intake
of fruits and vegetables was reported in several epide-
miological studies [12-15].
Physalis peruviana (golden berry) is a member of the
Solanaceae, an edible plant family. The fruit tastes like a
sweet tomato and includes high levels of vitamin C, vita-
min A, and the vitamin B-complex. The fruit was
demonstrated to have both anti-inflammatory and

extracts were reported to have anti-hepatoma activity
due to the induction of apoptosis in a human hepatocel-
lular carcinoma (Hep G2) cell line [19].
Recently, various cytotoxic withanolides (tubocapseno-
lide A, tubocapsanolide A, 20-hydroxytubocapsanolide
A, 23-hydroxytubocapsanolide A, tubocapsanolide F,
and anomanolide B) were isolated from Tubocapsicum
anomalum and reported to be effective against liver,
lung, and breast cancer cell lines [20]. Similarly, many
pure compounds such as a series of C28 steroidal lac-
tones, physalins, and withanolides, were extracted from
P. peruviana [21-23]; however, the bioactive compounds
with anticancer activities [19] are still unclear. This
raised the possibility that some withanolides from P.
peruviana are capable of anticancer activity.
On the basis of the description of active extracts from
P. peruviana, this plant was chosen as the basis for our
investigations. Using a bioactivity-guided fractionation
method, we isolated the major active compound,
4bHWE Although this was first isolated from P. peruvi-
ana by other researchers a long time ago [21], its possi-
ble cytotoxic role and mechanisms of action have not
been addressed. Accordingly, we proposed a hypothesis
that 4bHWE is one of the main potential anticancer
candidates in P. peruviana. To test this hypothesis, we
used golden berry-derived 4bHWE to investigate the
anticancer potential against human lung carcinoma
H1299 cells using a new toxicological technique.
Methods
Plant material
The plant material (10.8 kg) was collected at the Tainan
District Agricultural Research and Extension Station,
Taiwan, in April 2005. Before the extraction process, we
deposited the original plant as a voucher specimen
(standard) in the Graduate Institute of Natural Products
(Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) to
ensure adequate collection data.
Extraction and isolation
The aerial parts (stems and leaves) of P. peruviana (10.8
kg) were extracted three times with EtOH at room tem-
perature to obtain a crude extract. The crude extract
was partitioned with EtOAc and H2O (1:1, v/v) to give
an EtOAc layer which was then partitioned with n-hex-
ane, MeOH, and H2O (10:7:3, v/v/v) to give an MeOH/
H2O layer (65.2 g). The MeOH/H2O layer extract was
chromatographed over a silica gel column, using polarity
gradient mixtures of n-hexane-EtOAc-MeOH (1:0:0, 1
L), (40:1:0, 2 L), (20:1:0, 2 L), (10:1:0, 2 L), (1:1:0, 2 L),
(0:1:0, 3 L), (0:40:1, 2 L), (0:30:1, 2 L), (0:20:1, 2 L),
(0:10:1, 1 L), and (0:0:1, 1 L) as eluants, and this yielded
24 fractions. The volume for each fraction was 500 ml.
Fraction 15 (9154.4 mg) was subjected to Sephadex LH-
20 (EtOAc:MeOH 1:4), and the subfraction (fr. 15-3-7)
contained crystals which were acetone-washed to pro-
vide the main pure compound.
Cell cultures
Cells were routinely cultured in 1× RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, and 0.03% glutamine. All cells were kept
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
A H1299 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cell line was
used to test the cytotoxicity against lung cancer; an
HGF-1 (human normal gingival fibroblast) [24] cell line
was used as the normal control; and an NB4 (human
acute promyelocytic leukemia) cell line was the nuclear
extract (NE) resource for the comet-NE assay described
below.
Comet-NE assay
The protocol for the comet-NE assay was as described
previously [25,26]. In brief, NEs were prepared using
NB4 cells as described before [7,25,26]. The 100 μl ali-
q u o t so fH 1 2 9 9c e l ls u s p e n s i o n s( 1 × 1 0
6 cells/ml in
phosphate-buffered saline; PBS) were mixed with equal
volumes of 1.2% low-melting-point agarose (in PBS, pH
7.4) and immediately pipetted onto a slide precoated
with 1.2% regular agarose (in distilled water), and the
slide was placed on ice to solidify the gel. The third
layer (100 μl of 1.2% low-melting agarose gel) was
coated onto the solidified second gel, and then the slide
was placed on ice to solidify the gel. The slides were
immersed in freshly made ice-cold cell lysis solution (2.5
M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris (pH 10), 1% N-
laurylsarcosine, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), stored at 4°C for 2 h, and rinsed
with deionized water three times. A 20 μle x c i s i o nm i x -
ture containing 0.6 μg NE, 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH
7.9), 70 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2,0 . 4m ME D T A ,2m M
ATP, 40 mM phosphocreatine, and 2.5 mM creatine
phosphokinase was added to each slide for NE digestion.
A coverslip was applied, and the slides were then incu-
bated at 37°C for 2 h in a humidified space. The slides
were denatured in 0.3 N NaOH and 1 mM EDTA for
20 min followed by electrophoresis at 20 V and 300 mA
for 25 min. After being washed with deionized water,
the slides were transferred to 0.4 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).
Then 40 μl propidium iodide (PI, 50 μg/mL) was added.
For fluorescence microscopy (TE2000-U; Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan), the migration of DNA from the nucleus of each
cell was measured with a computer program http://tri-
tekcorp.com using the parameter of the percent of tail
DNA [27,28] which was the percentage of DNA in the
comet tail (sum of the intensities of pixels in the tail).

Page 2 of 8Proliferative inhibition test
The proliferation of cells was determined by a Trypan
blue dye exclusion assay as described [7,29]. In brief,
cells were treated with the vehicle control (DMSO) or
different doses of 4bHWE in media for 24 h. After incu-
bation, cells exposed to 0.2% Trypan blue were counted
in a hemocytometer, and cells stained with Trypan blue
were excluded. The proliferation rate was calculated
according to the percentage of drug-treated cells over
vehicle-treated cells. The assay was done in triplicate,
and the IC50 value was calculated by the slope and
intercept according to two concentrations of 4bHWE
between the half-maximal proliferative inhibitory
concentrations.
Flow cytometric determination of the cell cycle histogram
by PI staining
The cell cycle histogram was determined as described
before [29]. In brief, 1 × 10
6 cells per 100-mm Petri-
dish (at 70%~80% confluency) were treated with the
vehicle or 1 μg/mL of 4bHWE for 12 and 24 h. After
treatment, cells were collected, washed twice with PBS,
and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After centrifugation
at 700 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, the cell pellet was stained
with 10 μg/mL PI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 10 μg/mL
RNase A in PBS for 15 min at room temperature in the
dark. The analyses were performed with a FACScan
flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mansfield, MA) and
Cell-Quest and Modfit software (Becton-Dickinson).
Assessment of apoptosis
The accumulation of a sub-G1 population of H1299 cells
was determined by flow cytometry as described above.
To further confirm apoptosis in 4bHWE-induced H1299
cells, annexin V and PI double-staining (Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA) was performed as described before [30].
In brief, 1 × 10
6 cells per 100-mm Petri-dish (at 70%
~80% confluency) were treated with vehicle or 51 μg/
mL of 4bHWE for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were labeled
with annexin V-FITC (10 μg/mL)/PI (10 μg/mL); stained
slides were mounted, and analyzed using an inverted
fluorescence microscope (TE2000-U; Nikon). Alterna-
tively, the apoptotic ability of treated cells was analyzed
using a flow cytometric analysis as described before [31].
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± SD; Student’s t-test
was used to test the mean difference between the two
groups.
Results
The main pure compound from P. peruviana
The main pure compound isolated from P. peruviana
was 4bHWE according to the extraction method listed
in “Materials and Methods”.A c c o r d i n g l y ,t h et o t a lc o l -
lected plant extract was 10.8 kg, and the yield of
4bHWE was 866.5 mg. The chemical structure of
4bHWE is shown in Figure 1.
DNA damage determined by the comet assay
In the comet assay for the H1299 cell line, no “tail” was
found in the untreated control (DMSO alone) while the
“tail” grew after 4bHWE treatment (1, 5, and 10 μg/mL,
2 h) (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows that values of the
average percent tail DNA for the NE buffer control,
DMSO control (0.1%), and 4bHWE treatment (1, 5, and
10 μg/mL, 2 h) were 3.75% ± 2.04%

script letters). Accordingly, the DNA damage by
4bHWE had a significant dose-dependent effect. These
results suggested that DNA damage was involved in the
antiproliferation of 4bHWE towards lung cancer cells.
Proliferative inhibition test
Figure 3 shows that the IC50 values of the 4bHWE-trea-
ted H1299 cell line for 24 and 48 h were 0.6 and 0.71
μg/mL, respectively. Growth inhibition of H1299 cells
by 4bHWE occurred in a dose-responsive and time-
dependent manner (p < 0.05 and 0.001 for 24 and 48 h,
respectively).

sub-G1 percentages were 3.5% ± 0.7%, 3.8% ± 0.5%, and
8.1% ± 0.8% (n = 3) for the vehicle, and 12 and 24 h of
treatment with 4bHWE, respectively. G1 percentages
were dramatically reduced from 69.1% ± 3.3% (vehicle)
to 48.5% ± 3.6% and 43.7% ± 5.4% (n =3 )w i t h1 2a n d
24 h of 4bHWE treatment, respectively. G2/M percen-
tages were 18.6% ± 3.1%, 34.8% ± 1.9%, and 37.8% ±
0.3% (n = 3) for the vehicle or 12 and 24 h of 4bHWE
treatment, respectively. Accordingly, moderate sub-G1
accumulation and G2/M arrest were found in a time-
dependent manner for the 4bHWE-treated H1299 cell
line. All significant differences between the vehicle and
drug treatment are shown in Figure 4.
As shown in Figure 4, cell cycle arrest was not com-
plete, and only moderate accumulation at the sub-G1
phase occurred. To perform a confirmatory study, we
enhanced the dosage of 4bHWE to validate the cell
cycle disturbance (Figure 5A) and apoptotic cell death
(Figure 5B). Figure 5A shows that G2/M arrest was com-
plete with a higher dose of 5 μg/mL of 4bHWE treat-
ment for 24 h. Meanwhile, percentages of cells with a

statistical significance between drug treatment for 24 h and 48 h at the same concentration according to the Student t test (P < 0.05* and

ted H1299 cell line were 2.5% and 30.2%, respectively,
suggesting that sub-G1 accumulation was dose-depen-
dent compared to that of Figure 4 (8.1% with drug treat-
ment for 24 h).
Sub-G1 accumulation was further confirmed as being
due to apoptosis using annexin V/PI double-staining
(Figure 5B); i.e., annexin V-positive signals for drug and
vehicle treatments were 27.0% ± 4.3% and 8.1% ± 2.5%,
respectively. PI staining showed that apoptotic nuclei
increased in drug-treated cells (Figure 5D) compared to
the vehicle (Figure 5C). Annexin V staining showed
strong FITC fluorescence in drug-treated cells (Figure
5F) compared to the vehicle (Figure 5E).
Discussion
Selective activation of apoptosis is often cited as one of
the major goals of cancer chemotherapy. It is currently
t h o u g h tt h a td y s r e g u l a t e dc ell cycle proliferation and
apoptosis are important factors in the development of
cancer [32]. Therefore, it appears that exploiting the
apoptotic potential of cancer cells might lead to new
therapies that could be less toxic to normal cells due to
the physiologically controlled survival pathway [33].
The ethanol extract of P. peruviana was reported to
possess the lowest IC50 value against Hep G2 cells but
had no cytotoxic effect on normal BALB/C mouse liver
cells [19]; however, because these two cell lines are
derived from different species, they are unable to pro-
vide strong evidence that the extract is a potential che-
motherapeutic agent for lung cancer. Using cell lines of
the same species, we found that the IC50 of 4bHWE at
24 h was 3.75 μg/mL for the HGF-1 (human normal
gingival fibroblast) [24] cell line (data not shown) which
was higher than the IC50 of the H1299 human lung can-
cer cell line (at 0.71 μg/mL; Figure 3). These results
showed that H1299 cancer cells, but not a normal cell
line, were sensitive to 4bHWE. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that there are tissue-specific dif-
ferences between gingival and lung cells. Therefore,
further in vitro cell cytotoxicity studies using a normal
lung cell line, additional different lung cancer cell lines,
and an in vivo nude mice study are necessary to prove
that 4bHWE can inhibit tumor growth without major
side effects.
Genomic lesions due to activation of the DNA damage
response were detected, which then determined the cell
fate, i.e., either cycle arrest or apoptosis (Figures 3, 4).
However, both cell cycle interruption and apoptosis ana-
lyses are time-consuming and cannot be completed
within a short time, e.g., at least 12~24 h of drug treat-
ment is required. In contrast, the comet-NE assay was

Page 5 of 8very sensitive to DNA strand breaks and can rapidly be
performed [34], making it possible to determine the
extent of DNA damage within only 2 h [26]. Moreover,
to confirm the comet assay results, we enhanced the
dosage of 4bHWE according to the IC50 value; the
results of treatment with the IC50 and other higher con-
centrations were similar, and exhibited a dose-respon-
sive effect.
At high concentrations, the ethanol extract of P. per-
uviana induced cell cycle arrest, dose-dependent accu-
mulation of the sub-G1 peak, and apoptosis through
mitochondrial dysfunction [19]. In this study, the main
pure compound, 4bHWE from P. peruviana,w a su s e d
to treat the H1299 lung cancer cell line. The results
showed that cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase (Figures
4, 5A), dose-dependent accumulation of a sub-G1 peak
(Figure 4), and apoptosis were found in drug-treated
cells (Figure 5). Furthermore, we found that cell cycle
arrest at the G2/M phase was mediated by the ATM-
NBS1 pathway which was activated by double strand
breaks (data not shown).
The conventional alkaline comet assay is sensitive to
DNA strand breaks, but is not sensitive to DNA lesions
without strand breaks. In contrast, the NE in the comet-
NE assay theoretically contains all of the repair enzymes
and increases the incision of most kinds of DNA
damage. Therefore, the comet-NE assay [34-36] is gen-
erally more sensitive than the traditional comet assay.
However, different NEs from different cell lines may dis-
play differential excision activities for different types of
DNA adducts. For example, the NE of NTUB1 cells is
sensitive to ultraviolet C-induced DNA damage but is
less sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) than
the NE of BFTC905 cells [34]. Another problem with
the comet-NE assay is that details of the types of lesions
caused by the DNA damaging agent are not available.
To resolve this problem, lesion-specific enzymes [28]
can be used to replace the NE which may provide a
more-specific and -sensitive way to detect DNA damage.
Alternatively, immunodepletion coupled with the
comet-NE assay might reveal the specific type of DNA
damage [35].
Conclusions
We demonstrated herein that golden berry-derived
4bHWE had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of
H1299 lung carcinoma cells. This study demonstrated
that the DNA damage caused by 4bHWE is the result of

strated to have anti-lung cancer activity, along with the
potential to produce G2/M arrest and apoptosis in time-
dependent manners. Our ongoing study further validates
the effective cancer-preventive potential of 4bHWE in
other cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft assay. If
4bHWE is indeed proven to exert an effective cancer
preventive potential in vivo, golden berry-derived
4bHWE may be a promising ingredient as a cancer-pre-
ventive functional food.
