In the course of our pharmacological screening of Polygonaceae species occurring in the Carpathian 
Basin the extracts prepared from the roots of Rumex thyrsiflorus showed promising antiproliferative, 
xanthine oxidase inhibitory and antibacterial activities. The present work deals with the isolation of com-
pounds from the root of the plant. After multistep separation process, four compounds were obtained from 
the n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate soluble fractions of the methanol extract of the root. The 
structures of the isolated compounds were determined as 1-palmitoylglycerol, β-sitosterol, (–)-epicate-
chin, and procyanidin B5. 
Keywords: Rumex thyrsiflorus – Polygonaceae – phenolic compounds – procyanidin
Rumex genus (sorrel), belonging to the Polygonaceae family, comprises about 200 
species distributed worldwide. Several species are used traditionally either as foods 
(soup or salad) or as healing agents [15, 17]. The aerial parts, leaves and roots of 
the plants (e.g. R. acetosa, R. acetosella, R. alpinus, R. confertus, R. crispus and 
R. ob tusi folius) are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of different health 
disorders such as infections, oedema, mild diabetes, jaundice, diarrhoea, constipation, 
as an antihypertensive, diuretic, and analgesic drug, and in case of skin disorders and 
inflammation [1, 4, 5, 17]. Rumex species are characterized by the accumulation of 
anthraquinones, naphthalenes, flavonoids, and stilbenoids [17].
Pharmacological investigation of Polygonaceae species occurring in the Carpathian 
Basin resulted in the discovery of antiproliferative, xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory 
and antibacterial activity of numerous species. Among them Rumex thyrsiflorus 
Fingerh. possessed remarkable effect in all three test systems [in the antiproliferative 
assay the CHCl3 fraction of the roots (96.20% inhibition on A431, and 88.55% inhibi-
tion on MCF7 cell lines, at a concentration of 30 µg/mL) [7]; in the XO inhibitory 
assay the remaining aqueous fraction of both of the herb (IC50 = 78.45 µg/mL) and 
the roots (IC50 = 39.25 µg/mL) [12]; and in the antibacterial test the remaining aque-
ous fraction of the roots (inhibitory zones: 11.3 mm (Staphylococcus epidermidis),

12.3 mm (S. aureus), 9.7 mm (MRSA), 10.3 mm (Bacillus subtilis), and 10.7 mm 
(Moraxella catarrhalis)] [13].
The aim of the present work was the phytochemical investigation of R. thyrsiflorus, 
in order to identify the characteristic secondary metabolites of the plant which can be 
responsible for the pharmacological activities. The roots were collected, in Szeghalom, 
Hungary (47°0’33.78”N, 21°10’48.89”E). Botanical identification of the plant mate-
rial was performed by Gusztáv Jakab (Institute of Environmental Sciences, Szent 
István University, Szarvas, Hungary). A voucher specimen (No. 803) has been depos-
ited at the Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.
The dried roots of R. thyrsiflorus (850 g) were percolated with methanol (15 L) at 
room temperature. The crude extract was concentrated in vacuo to 200 mL and sol-
vent–solvent partition was performed with n-hexane, CHCl3 and EtOAc (3 × 500 mL 
each). From n-hexane fraction (5.2 g) compound 2 was crystallized. The CHCl3 frac-
tion (3.6 g) was separated by reverse phase MPLC (medium pressure liquid chroma-
tography) [Büchi, Pump Manager C615, Pump Module C605, using prepacked 
RP-cartridge (RP18ec sorbent, 40–63 μm]) with gradient mixtures of MeOH–H2O 
(from 1:9 to 9:1) to yield 10 subfractions. Subfraction 2 was further purified by rota-
tion planar chromatography (RPC) (Chromatotron instrument, Model 8924, Harrison 
Research, USA) on silica gel 60 GF254 with the gradient system of CH2Cl2–MeOH 
(from 9:1 to 1:1), and 4 fractions were obtained. Fraction 2 was purified by TLC using 
the mobile phase EtOAc–MeOH–H2O (100:16:12) to yield compound 3. The EtOAc 
fraction (47 g) was separated by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) on silica gel 
with gradient mixtures of CHCl3–MeOH (from 95:5 to 1:1). Fractions with similar 
composition were combined according to TLC monitoring to yield 10 main fractions. 
From fraction 2 compound 1 was crystallized. Fraction 6 was further purified by gel 
filtration on Sephadex LH-20 with CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1), and 7 subfractions were 
obtained. Subfraction 5 was separated by RPC using EtOAc–EtOH–H2O (4:1:5) and 
compound 4 was isolated.
Structures of the compounds (1–4) were established by MS (API 2000 MS/MS 
equipped with an electrospray (ESI) interface) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy 
[Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer, at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), δ in 
ppm rel. to TMS as internal standard, J in Hz, solvent CD3OD; 2D experiments were 
performed with a standard Bruker software]. The high resolution MS spectra for the 
new compound (1) was acquired on a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap 
mass spectrometer equipped with ESI ion source in positive ionization mode. The 
resolution was over 1 ppm. The data were acquired and processed with the MassLynx 
software.
Compound 1 was isolated as yellow oil. Its HRESIMS provided the molecular 
formula, C19H38O4, through the presence of a peak at m/z 331.1883 [M + H]+ (calcd. 
for C19H39O4, 331.1904). NMR δH (500 MHz, CDCl3, data measured for the first time 
in this solvent) 4.20 (1H, dd J = 11.7, 4.6 Hz, H-1a), 4.15 (1H, dd, J = 11.7, 6.2 Hz, 
H-1b), 3.93 (1H, quint, J = 5.7 Hz, H-2), 3.70 (1H, dd, J = 11.5, 3.9 Hz, H-3a), 3.60 
(1H, dd, J = 11.5, 5.8 Hz, H-3b), 2.35 (2H, t, J = 7.5 Hz, H-2’), 1.63 (2H, quint,

J = 7.5 Hz, H-3’), 1.29 (2H, m, H-15’), 1.25 (22H, m, H-4’–H-14’),0.88 (3H, t, 
J = 6.9 Hz, H-16’); δC (125 MHz, CDCl3) 174.4 (C-1’), 70.3 (C-2), 65.1 (C-1), 63.3 
(C-3), 34.1 (C-2’), 31.9 (C-15’), 4 × 29.7 (C-11’–14’), 2 × 29.6 (C-9’, C-10’), 2 × 29.4 
(C7’, C-8’), 29.3 (C-6’), 2 × 29.1 (C-4’, C-5’), 24.9 (C-3’), 14.1 (C-16’). The 1H 
NMR data were in agreement with data reported in the literature for palmitoleic acid 
part of a monoacyl glycerol (in CD3OD) [6]. Based on the MS and NMR data com-
pound 1 was identified as 1-palmitoylglycerol.

Polyphenols in Rumex thyrsiflorus 235
Acta Biologica Hungarica 68, 2017
Previously, anthraquinones (chrysophanol, rhein, emodin, physcion and their gly-
cosides), phenolic acids (caffeic, gallic and p-hydroxybenzoic acid), flavonoids 
[quercetin, myricetin, rutin, isorhamnetin, (+)-catechin, and (–)-epicatechin gallate] 
were identified from the plant [8]. This was the first time that 1-palmitoylglycerol (1), 
β-sitosterol (2), epicatechin (3) and procyanidin B5 (4) were isolated from the roots 
of R. thyrsiflorus. In our previous investigations, (–)-epicatechin (3) possessed anti-
bacterial activity against MRSA at concentration 100 µg/mL [10], and antiprolifera-
tive effect on parental L5178 (IC50 = 8 µg/mL) and MDR1-transfected L5178 
(IC50 = 6 µg/mL) cells (Table 1). Compound 4 was also effective against MDR lym-
phoma (IC50 = 13 µg/mL) cells [9]. The combination of β-sitosterol (2) and stigmas-
terol showed antitumor activity against A431 (IC50 = 2.62 µM) and MRC-5 
(IC50 = 11.31 µM) human tumour cell lines [3]. Finally, (–)-epicatechin (3) possessed 
marked (IC50 = 2.04 µM) xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity [14].
Based on the above-mentioned data the isolated compounds can be at least partly 
responsible for the antibacterial and antiproliferative activities of the plant.
