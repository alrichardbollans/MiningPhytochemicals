Plant Physiol. (1 993) 103: 1269-1 276 Choline Synthesis in Spinach in Relation to Salt Stress' Peter S. Summers and Elizabeth A. Weretilnyk* Department of Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4K1 Canada Choline metabolism was examined in spinach (Spinacia oleracea 1.) plants growing under nonsaline and saline conditions. In spin- ach, choline is required for phosphatidylcholine synthesis and as a precursor for the compatible osmolyte glycine betaine (betaine). When control (nonsalinized) leaf discs were incubated for up to 2 h with [1,2-"C]ethanolamine, label appeared in the N-methylated derivatives of phosphoethanolamine including phosphomono-, phosphodi-, and phosphotri- (i.e. phosphocholine) methyl- ethanolamine, as well as in choline and betaine, whereas no radioactivity could be detected in the mono- and dimethylated derivatives of the free base ethanolamine. Leaf discs from salinized plants showed the same pattern of labeling, although the propor- tion of label that accumulated in betaine was almost 3-fold higher in the salinized leaf discs. Enzymes involved in choline metabolism were assayed in crude leaf extracts of plants. lhe activities of ethanolamine kinase and of the three S-adenosylmethio- nine:phospho-base N-methyltransferase enzymes responsible for N-methylating phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine were all higher in extracts of plants salinized step-wise to 100, 200, or 300 mM NaCl compared with controls. In contrast, choline kinase, phosphocholine phosphatase, and cytidine 5'-triphosphate: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activities showed little varia- tion with salt stress. Thus, the increased diversion of choline to betaine in salt-stressed spinach appears to be mediated by the increased activity of severa1 key enzymes involved in choline bio- synthesis. Interest in Cho metabolism has largely arisen from the role of Cho in the synthesis of PtdCho, a dominant constituent of membrane phospholipids. In many plant species, notably members of Gramineae (barley) and Chenopodiaceae (sugar beet and spinach), Cho also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of the quaternary ammonium compound, glycine betaine (betaine). More recently, Cho has been shown to be the precursor for the synthesis of choline-O-sulfate in salin- ized Limonium (Plumbaginaceae) (Hanson et al., 1991). Be- taine and choline-O-sulfate are believed to be compatible, cytoplasmic osmolytes whose accumulation plays a role in the adaptation of many plants to conditions of drought or salinity (Wyn Jones et al., 1977). From this perspective, Cho synthesis can be viewed not only as having an essential and ubiquitous role in plant phospholipid metabolism, but as playing a fundamental role in the adaptation of many plants toward osmotic stress. In vivo radiotracer studies have been used to study Cho and betaine synthesis in plants. In sugar beet, PCho is syn- ' This work was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences * Corresponding author; fax 1-905-522-6066. and Engineering Research Council of Canada (OGP0105788). 1269 thesized by the sequential N-methylation of PEA to PCho, hence a phospho-base route (Hanson and Rhodes, 1983). Cho is generated, presumably, by the hydrolytic action of PCho phosphatase. Coughlan and Wyn Jones (1982) have reported that Cho synthesis in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) may proceed by the direct N-methylation of EA to Cho, or a free-base route. Both the free- and phospho-base routes involve water-soluble intermediates. In water-stressed barley (Hitz et al., 1981), PEA is N-methylated to form PMEA, but the two subsequent N-methylations can occur at the phos- pho-base level or at the level of the lipid-soluble phosphatidyl bases, PtdMEA and PtdDEA, forming PtdCho (phosphatidyl- base route). In barley (Hitz et al., 1981) and wheat (MC- Donnell and Wyn Jones, 1988), the release of Cho for betaine synthesis appears to require the tumover of PtdCho from membranes. Cho biosynthesis has also been examined in a number of pIant species that do not accumulate betaine. For these plants, considerable variation has been reported for the routes by which Cho is synthesized for PtdCho. Cho synthesis by Lemna paucicostata appears to proceed by the sequential N- methylation of PEA, analogous to the phospho-base route described for sugar beet (Mudd and Datko, 1986). Soybean and carrot also N-methylate PEA to form PMEA (Datko and Mudd, 1988a). However, soybean cames out the subsequent N-methylations at the level of the phosphatidyl bases, whereas carrot appears to N-methylate at either the phospho- or phosphatidyl-base level. In castor bean endosperm, the first compound to be N-methylated is the free-base EA with subsequent N-methylations occumng at the free-, phospho-, and phosphatidyl-base levels (Prudhomme and Moore, 1992a). Elevated Cho levels in the culture medium of L. paucicostata (Mudd and Datko, 1989a), carrot, or soybean (Mudd and Datko, 1989b) resulted in the feedback inhibition of Cho biosynthesis, providing compelling evidence that the syn- thetic pathway of Cho is tightly regulated in these plants. The point of regulation was tentatively identified by Mudd and Datko (1989~) as the point of the first N-methyltransfer, i.e. the enzyme converting PEA to PMEA. Regulation at the N-methylation of PEA has also been proposed for betaine synthesis in salt-stressed sugar beet (Hanson and Rhodes, 1983). If this regulation does operate in plants that accumu- Abbreviations: Cho, choline; DMEA, N,N-dimethylethanolamine; EA, ethanolamine; MCW, methano1:chloroform:water; MEA, N- methylethanolamine; MeT, N-methyltransferase; SAM, S-adenosyl- methionine.

We undertoo): this study to examine the Cho biosynthetic pathway in the betaine-accumulating chenopod, spinach. In an earlier radiotracer study, Coughlan and Wyn Jones (1982) identified intermediates involved in the synthesis of Cho, PtdCho, and betaine in spinach. Using in vivo labeling ki- netics and estimates of pool sizes for water-soluble and lipid- soluble intermediates in unsalinized and salinized spinach, these authors provided evidence that Cho destined for be- taine production was synthesized by a route involving water- soluble as opposed to lipid-soluble intermediates. Of the two possible routes involving water-soluble intermediates, Coughlan and Wyn Jones (1982) provided some evidence supporting the clirect N-methylation of EA in the synthesis of Cho for betaine, but the authors could not discount the involvement of phospho-base intermediates. However, their proposal that Cho synthesis in spinach proceeds by the free- base route is difficult to reconcile with the evidence for a phospho-base rciute in the closely related chenopod, sugar beet, grown under saline conditions (Hanson and Rhodes, 1983). In this report we compare Cho biosynthesis in leaf discs excised from plants growing under nonsaline and saline conditions. By identifying and quantifying the radiolabeled water-soluble intermediates, we provide evidence that phos- pho bases and not free bases serve as intermediates leading to the synthesis of Cho for betaine production. Furthermore, we report on the effect of salt stress on the activity of severa1 key enzymes involved in Cho metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Material Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Savoy Hybrid 612) plants were grown under the following growth chamber conditions: 8 h, 24OC d, 325 pmol m-'s-l PAR/16 h, 19OC night. Plants were grown individually in 350-mL plastic pots filled with coarse vermiculite. The salt stress of plants was started 3 weeks after emergence and was carried out following the step-wise saliniza tion procedure described previously (Weigel et al., 1986). Chemicals 1 A11 radioactive chemicals were purchased from New Eng- land Nuclear. PMEA and PDEA were prepared by phospho- lipase C (Sigma, type XI from Bacillus cereus) treatment of PtdMEA or PtdDEA (Sigma) as outlined by Datko and Mudd (1988b). For N-methyltransferase assays, SAM ,(Boehringer Mannheim) was dissolved in 0.01 N HzS04:ethanol (9:L v/v). The concentration of SAM was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of 15 M-' cm-' at 257 nm (Elor- anta et al., 1976). Ion-exchange resins were obtained from Bio-Rad. lsotopic Labeling of Leaf Discs Five leaf discs cif 1.4 cm diameter were excised from leaves 5 and 6 (leaves 1 and 2 being the oldest) of 4-week-old plants grown in the absence of NaCl or salinized step-wise to 100 m NaCl. Sets of five leaf discs were placed in 50-mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 5 mL of H 2 0  containing 1 pCi of [1,2-14C]EA (4.8 mCi mmol-'), pH 7.0. The leaf discs were vacuum infiltrated with this solution and then transfened to a 60 X 15 mm Petri dish along with the infiltration medium. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm and then the leaf discs were incubated for 10 min under fluorescent lights (250 pmol m-2 s-' PAR) at 22OC with gentle agitation. Follclwing incubation with the infiltration medium, the leaf discs were gently blotted dry and transferred to a second Petri dish containing 5 mL of HzO, and the incubation under lightj was continued without agitation for varying lengths of time. At the end of the second incubation period, the discs were washed for 1 min in 20 mL of 0.5 m EA, blotted dry, and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. lsolation and Measurement of Labeled Compounds Immediately after freezing, leaf discs were ground in a chilled mortar with 5.5 mL of methanol:chlorofonr1:2 N formic acid (12:5:3, v/v/v) (Datko and Mudd, 1988a). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,OOOg for 10 min at 4OC. The supematant was reduced to approximately 100 pL at 45OC under a stream of N2 gas and to this reduced volume, 900 pL of MCW (12:5:1, v/v/v) was added. The pellet ob- tained was re-extracted once with 3 mL of MCW, centrifuged at 12,OOOg for 10 min, and then combined with the first supematant. The 4-mL MCW extract was then phase wpa- rated by adding 1.5 mL of HzO and 1 mL of chlorofonri and the mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge. The lower, lipid phase was re-extracted once with 4 mL of MCW, 1.5 mL of HzO, and the phase separatiori was repeated. The water-soluble phases were pooled and dned down at 45OC with N2 gas and the pellets were dissolved in 10 mL of H20. The water-soluble compounds were then fractionated by a series of three ion-exchange columns as described by Hitz et al. (1981), except that columns contained 2 mL of resin and a11 eluates were evaporated to drynass at 45OC under NZ. Phospho bases eluted from the AG-l(OH-) column were resuspended in 1 mL of H20 and applied to a I-mL column of AG-50(H+). The phospho bases were then eluted with 10 mL of 0.1 N HCI and evaporated to dryness. This step was required to remove trace levels of [1,2-14C]EA, which carried over on AG-1 columns. The phospho-base samples were dissolved in 300 pL of 200 m Tris-HC1 (pH 8.5) and incu- bated for 12 h at 37OC with 5 pL (20 units/pL) of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). The phosphatase-treated samples were diluted to 10 mL with H 2 0  and applied to a 2-mL column of AG-l(OH-), which drained into a 2-mL column of BioRex 70. Sample application was followed by 10 mL of H20, the BioRex 70 resin was eluted with 8 mL of 1 N HCl, and the eluate was taken to dryness. Recovery of [1,2-14C]EA and radiolabeled EA deriv- atives was estimated at a11 stages of sample fractionation by removing aliquots and quantifying radioactivity by liquid scintillation. Acidic conditions were maintained during a111 of the procedures to prevent the volatization of the free bases (Mudd and Datko, 1986).

In the presence of either salinized or control tissue, recoveries of approximately 78, 98, 75, and 84% were achieved for [1,2-'4C]EA, [methyl-'4C]PCho, [methyl-"CICho, and L-(Y- dipalmitoyl, [Ch~-methyl-'~C]PtdCho, respectively. A11 samples (free bases, betaine, and phosphatase-treated phospho bases) were resuspended in 20 pL of 0.1 N HC1. For analysis by TLC, 1 to 2 pL of each sample was applied to Silica Gel G plates (Brinkman). Samples were also applied with unlabeled and radiolabeled standards. Plates were chro- matographed for 150 min using the solvent system of Hitz et al. (1981), dried, and then exposed to iodine vapors. EA and MEA were also detected on TLC plates by ninhydrin reagent, whereas Dragendorff's reagent was used to detect Cho and betaine (Hanson and Nelsen, 1978). TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film and the developed film was scanned using an LKB GelScan XL densitometer to estimate the relative pro- portion of label in betaine, the free bases, and the phospha- tase-treated phospho bases. Extract Preparation A11 operations were carried out at 4OC. For each salinity level, deveined leaf tissue from at least three individual plants was harvested, coarsely chopped, and mixed, and a sample of tissue (8 g) was withdrawn for extract preparation. Extracts for enzyme activity measurements were also prepared from leaf discs. These discs were prepared as described for those used for in vivo labeling, and incubation was carried out for 2 h in 5 mL of H20. However, for these discs there was no initial 10-min incubation with [1,2-'4C]EA and tissue was not frozen prior to processing. In a11 cases, tissue was ground thoroughly using a mortar and pestle with sand and an extraction buffer (2 mL g-' fresh weight) containing 0.1 M Tris-HC1 (pH 7.8, 4OC), 5 mM DTT, 2 mM Na2EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The homogenate was squeezed through two layers of cheesecloth and one layer of Miracloth. A 1- mL aliquot of the brei was removed for CTP-PCho cytidylyl- transferase determination and the remainder of the homog- enate was centrifuged at 10,OOOg for 10 min. The supematant was recovered and low mo1 wt compounds were removed by centrifugation through Sephadex G-25 columns (Weigel et al., 1986) equilibrated with 50 m~ Hepes (pH 7.8), 5 m~ DTT, and 1 m~ Na2EDTA. This Sephadex G-25- desalted leaf extract was used for the remaining enzyme activity measurements. Enzyme Assays EA kinase and Cho kinase activities were measured using the assay conditions outlined by Mudd and Datko (1989a) with [1,2-I4C]EA and [methyl-'4C]Cho (53 mCi mmol-') as substrates, respectively. PCho phosphatase was assayed as described by Tanaka et al. (1966). SAM:phospho-base N- methyltransferase activities were assayed using a reaction mixture modified from that described by Datko and Mudd (1988b) with PEA (Sigma), PMEA, or PDEA as substrates. The assay (final volume of 150 pL) contained 100 m~ Hepes- KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mM Na2EDTA, 250 p~ phospho base, 200 p~ SAM, 4 nM [3H]SAM (0.55 pCi; 80 Ci mmol-'), and 47.5 pL of extract. Incubation conditions, ion-exchange chroma- tography, and quantification of reaction products by liquid scintillation counting were completed as described by Datko and Mudd (1988b). CTP:PCho cytidylyltransferase activity was assayed as described by Datko and Mudd (1988b) using a 30-min incubation period and [methyl-'4C]PCho (50 mCi mmol-') as substrate. Protein concentration was estimated using the method of Bradford (1976) with BSA as the standard. RESULTS Leaf discs from nonsalinized and salinized spinach were vacuum infiltrated with [1,2-'4C]EA. Figure 1 shows the distribution of label among the water-soluble and lipid-sol- uble compounds, the relative quantity of each being ex- pressed as a percentage of total label recovered at any given time point. Assuming that the total radioactivity appearing in the water- and lipid-soluble fractions after the 10-min incubation provides a reasonable estimate of the total [1,2-'4C]EA taken up by the tissues, then approximately 70 nmol g-' fresh weight of [1,2-'4C]EA was taken up by the 50 40 U 2 30 O o o) a - o) J .&2 20 M 10 O I / / qnn 1. 1 f 20 n -100 20 e0 120 Tlms lminl .J -10 o 20 60 120 Time (minl Figure 1.

For leaf discs from nonsalinized and salinized plants, approximately 24 and 13%, respectively, of labeled EA taken up remained as EA at the end of the 120- min incubation period (Fig. 1, inset). Approximately 44% of the label from [ 1,2-'4C]EA accumulated in the lipid-soluble fraction by 120 min, irrespective of treatment. A notable difference between the control (nonsalinized) and salinized discs is seen in the distribution of radiolabel among the water- soluble compounds derived from [1,2-I4C]EA. Specifically, after 20, 60, antl 120 min of incubation, a proportionately greater amount of radioactivity was associated with the water-soluble EA derivatives extracted from leaf discs of salinized plants compared with control discs. Moreover, whereas the level of radiolabel accumulating in the water- soluble derivatives other than EA itself declined in the control leaf discs over the 120-min incubation period, this level remained relatively constant in the salinized discs over the same interval. The water-soluble compounds were fractionated by ion- exchange resins smd components resolved and identified by TLC. Of the labeled water-soluble compounds, Cho, betaine, and the phospho bases PEA, PMEA, PDEA, and PCho were identified. AI1 of these EA derivatives were found in the discs obtained from nonsalinized and salinized plants. No radio- activity was detected in MEA or DEA. We did not detect radiolabeled betaine aldehyde in our study, but this is likely due to the very low levels of this metabolite in spinach (Coughlan and Wyn Jones, 1982). The distribution of I4C in Cho, betaine, and the phospho- base derivatives of EA as a function of time is shown in Figure 2. It is important to note that at the time period designated O, the discs had already been incubated with water containing [1,2-I4C]EA for 10 min. Hence, at O min, I4C was already detected in PEA, PMEA, PDEA, PCho, Cho, and betaine in control and salinized leaf discs. In tissue receiving either treatment, PEA dominated the radioactive phospho bases produced within the first 20 min and the accumulation of label in PMEA or PDEA was very low. In control discs, the amount of labeled PEA, PMEA, and PDEA decreased over the 120-min incubation period, whereas la- beled PCho and betaine increased and labeled Cho remained relatively constant. A similar pattern was shown for salinized ' leaf discs, except that PCho levels appeared to reach a plateau by 20 min. Figure 2 shows that proportionately more I4C accumulated as PCho, Cho, and betaine in the salinized tissue, and that for Cho and betaine this difference was sustained over the 120-min incubation period. For example, the proportion of radiolabel in betaine by 120 min was almost 3-fold greater in discs of salinized plants than in those of controls. This is true despite the 2.4-fold lower uptake of [1,2-I4C]EA by the salinized tissue. Specifically, '*C-labeled betaine synthesized by salinized discs over 120 min reached 3.5 nmol g-' fresh weight as opposed to 2.7 nmol g-' fresh weight in control discs. Since these rates apply only to the synthesis of radio- labeled betaine, they should be considered as minimal esti- mates of the actual rates of betaine synthesis in these tissues.

A modest but reproducible 1.5- to 2-fold increase is seen in the activities of a11 four enzymes (Fig. 3, A and B) in crude leaf extracts of plants salinized to 300 mM NaCI. Data shown in Figure 3 use enzyme activities calculated on a per mg protein basis. This increase is also seen if calculations are based on g fresh weight of leaf material or mg of Chl (data not shown). For EA kinase i(Fig. 3A) and PEAMeT (Fig. 3B), enzyme activity increased in plants exposed to successively higher levels of salt in the irrigating medium. PMEAMeT and PDEAMeT activities also increased in tissue of salt-stressed plants (Fig. 3B), but these changes in activity do not appear to be incremental with increases in salinity. PCho, once synthesized, could remain as PCho or it could be directed toward the synthesis of PtdCho by the enzyme CTP:PCho cytidylyltransferase or Cho by the enzyme PCho phosphatase. Cho that is not oxidized to betaine aldehyde and betaine could be salvaged as PCho by the activity of Cho kinase or stored as Cho. Therefore, the activities of CTP:PCho cytidylyltransferase, PCho phosphatase, and Cho kinase were assayed in crude leaf extracts of nonsalinized (snd salinized spinach (Fig. 4). CTP:PCho cytidylyltransferase m d  Cho kinase activity remain essentially unchanged upon sal- inization. The specific activity of PCho phosphatase in the plants examined is much higher than either CTP:PCho cyti- dylyltransferase or Cho kinase, and a salt-responsive increase in PCho phosphatase activity is not found.

This assumption may be sim- plistic because it does not consider mechanisms that might control the activity of this enzyme in vivo, such as restricted access of PCho to the phosphatase by compartmentation. The in vitro enzyme activity measurements suggest that Cho synthesis should be up-regulated in salinized plants and that the enzymes contributing to this up-regulation include EA kinase, PEAMeT, PMEAMeT, and PDEAMeT. Therefore, we assayed the activity of these enzymes in representative leaf discs (a) before vacuum infiltration and (b) following infiltration and a 120-min incubation period under lights. These measurements were completed each time in vivo label- ing was carried out, and the results corresponding to the experiment shown in Figure 2 are given in Table I. These assays were done to ensure that the in vivo-labeling studies summarized in Figure 2 were not affected by a significant change in the activity of one or more of these critica1 Cho biosynthetic enzymes. Table I, also in agreement with the results shown in Figure 3, indicates that the activities of a11 four enzymes are higher in the discs excised from plants salinized to 100 m~ NaCl than in those of the nonsalinized plants. Vacuum infiltration and a subsequent 120-min incubation did not affect EA kinase, PMEAMeT, and PDEAMeT activities, although PEAMeT activity dropped. Even with the decline in PEAMeT activity, the amount of enzyme activity remaining (roughly 70-80% of the starting activity) is still higher in the salinized tissue. Thus, although quantitatively the amount of 14C- labeled PMEA synthesized might be compromised by this drop in PEAMeT activity, qualitatively the in vivo-labeling pattem that distinguishes nonsalinized from salinized tissue, as shown in Figure 2, should not be affected. With respect to quantitative rates of conversion, PEAMeT in control leaf discs converted 11.4 nmol g-' fresh weight of 14C-labeled PEA through PMEA to other products during the labeling period, whereas the higher enzyme activity of salinized discs con- verted less (8.5 nmol g-' fresh weight). This would suggest that PEAMeT activity was not limiting during the in vivo- labeling period and that differential stability of this enzyme in the two types of discs was not a factor contributing to the pattem of in vivo label distribution shown in Figure 2. DlSCUSSlON The identity and distribution of I4C among the water- soluble in vivo-radiolabeled products shown in Figure 2 is consistent with the route for Cho synthesis summarized by solid arrows in the metabohc grid given in Figure 5. This phospho-base route of Cho synthesis involves the conversion of EA to PEA, followed by the sequential N-methylation of PMEA to PCho, and finally the hydrolysis of PCho to form Cho.

However, in this study a comparison of the distribution of radiolabel among the water-soluble compounds frorn both nonsalinized and salinized spinach was camed out. Figure 2 shows that the phospho-base route and not the free-base route is the predominant if not sole pathway for Cho synthesis involving water-soluble interme- diates in spinach leaves. Specifically, neither growth condi- tion results in thle movement of label through MEA or DEA. In support of the phospho-base route, the enzymic N-meth- ylation of PEA to PMEA could be readily detected in crude leaf extracts from spinach leaves (Fig. 3B and Table I). With respect to lipid-soluble intermediates, our study does not preclude the involvement of this route in the synthesis of Cho for oxidation to betaine since the distribution of label among the phosphatidyl bases was not detennined over the labeling period. However, in an earlier study using control and salinized spinach, Coughlan and Wyn Jones (1982) showed that the flux rate of ‘*C-labeling among the phos- phatidyl bases PtdEA, PtdMEA, PtdDEA, and PtdCho was too low to account for the rapid appearance of label in betaine. Based on time-course measurements camed out over the initial 30 min of in vivo labeling, the authors concluded that I4C appearing in betaine could not arise from 14C-labeled PtdCho. Considerable variation may exist among nonchenopod plants with respect to the pathways proposed for PtdCho or Cho biosynthesis (Hitz et al., 1981; Datko and Mudd, 1988a; Prud’homme and Moore, 1992a). Specifically, the phospho- base pathway, and in particular, an enzyme responsible for N-methylating PEA, may not be universal to a11 plants or plant tissues. For example, a phospho-base route for PtdCho synthesis has been proposed for a phylogenetically diverged plant species that does not accumulate betaine, Lemna pau- cicostata (Mudd and Datko, 1986), and a PEA N-methyltrans- ferase has been detected in this species (Datko and Mudd, 1988b). In contrast, castor bean endospenn appears to lack the enzyme N-methylating PEA, but it possesses an enzyme ... b M,EA . .  . b  D,EA . . . P  Cho - Betaine - Belaitie 1 T PEA ---.

In castor bean, the main flux proposed for PtdCho and Cho synthesis likely includes the free- and phospho-base routes from the point of MEA or PMEA. In this study we were unable to detect either 14C-labeled IMEA or DEA among the radiolabeled compounds. Earlier (Were- tilnyk and Summers, 1992), we reported that the activity of an enzyme capable of N-methylating EA to form MEA could not be detected in crude, desalted extracts of spinach leyes. Both of these observations would argue against the involve- ment of a free-base route for Cho synthesis as found in cilstor bean endosperm (Prud’homme and Moore, 1992a) cir in spinach as proposed earlier by Coughlan and Wyn Jones (1982). In spinach, evidence for the free-base route rests largely upon the results of trapping experiments with MEA and DEA in that the added free bases appeared to in hibit betaine synthesis. However, in these experiments the phos- pho-base intermediates were not analyzed in sufficient detail to preclude their involvement in the synthesis of betaine. Immediately following the initial 10-min labeling peiiod, 49% of the [1,2-I4C]EA taken by the nonsalinized tiiscs Table 1. Activities of enzymes for the synthesis of €A phospho-derivatives in leaf discs of nonsalinized and salinized spinach Five discs were excised from leaves of nonsalinized (O mM NaCI) and salinized (100 mM NaCI) spinach plants.

When discs of either treatment were transferred to a medium without label, within 20 min the remaining amount of [1,2-14C]EA drops to 41 and 18% for nonsalinized and salinized discs, respectively. Thus, dur- ing this initial incorporation period, the proportion of label moving out of EA appears to be more rapid in the salinized tissue. The movement of radiolabeled EA toward water- soluble compounds is the main feature that distinguishes EA metabolism of nonsalinized from salinized discs during the time period studied, and not the identity of these compounds (as discussed above) or the proportion of label recovered in lipid-soluble compounds. By the conclusion of the 10-min labeling period, there is already 2.5- to 3-fold more 14C appearing as PCho, Cho, and betaine in salinized leaf discs compared with nonsalinized discs. During the subsequent 20-min incubation period, salinized discs incorporated I4C from [1,2-’4C]EA into betaine at a rate of 0.068 nmol g-’ fresh weight min-’, whereas the rate for unsalinized discs was almost 2.3-fold lower at 0.030 nmol g-’ fresh weight min-I. Therefore, more labeled betaine is produced in the salinized discs despite an uptake of [1,2-’4C]EA, which is approximately 2.4-fold lower than that of nonsalinized discs. Although we did not attempt to measure absolute pool sizes for the various intermediates in this study, published estimates for spinach (Coughlan and Wyn Jones, 1982) and sugar beet (Hanson and Rhodes, 1983) are available. These estimates indicate that the pool sizes for PMEA and PDEA are relatively small in salt-stressed tissue, and although PCho and Cho levels are considerably higher, the metabolically active pools of PCho and Cho are relatively small (Hanson and Rhodes, 1983). If these small, metabolically active pools fumish a11 or most of the Cho for betaine synthesis as opposed to the large storage pools of Cho or PCho, then the flux rate through the Cho biosynthetic pathway must be up- regulated under saline conditions ‘to accommodate the in- creased requirement of cho  for betaine production. Indeed, the activities of the enzymes responsible for the conversion of EA to PEA and the N-methylation of PEA to PCho were a11 higher in extracts of leaves of salinized spinach plants. Therefore, the up-regulation of Cho synthesis in salinized plants is likely to be mediated by the increased activity of the Cho biosynthetic enzymes including EA kinase, PEAMeT, PMEAMeT, and PDEAMeT. It is interesting that the 2- to 3-fold increase in the activity of these enzymes in salinized spinach plants is similar to the modest increases reported for the activity of the two enzymes responsible for oxidizing Cho to betaine, namely Cho mono- oxygenase (Brouquisse et al., 1989) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (Weigel et al., 1986). For the terminal enzyme of the betaine biosynthetic pathway, betaine aldehyde de- hydrogenase, this modest increase in activity upon saliniza- tion can be attributed to increased levels of protein and transcripts for this enzyme (Weretilnyk and Hanson, 1989, 1990; McCue and Hanson, 1992). However, it is not known whether the increases in activity found for the Cho biosyn- thetic enzymes shown in Figure 3 also require de novo synthesis or whether these increases can be accomplished by a salt-responsive activation of existing enzymes. Furthermore, the seemingly osmoresponsive increase in activity found for EA kinase and PEAMeT in plants salinized step-wise to 300 r m í  NaCl strongly resembles the incremental changes in betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity upon salinization (Weigel et al., 1986). Thus, in plants salinized gradually to 100, 200, or 300 m~ NaCl, there is a step-wise increase in the leve1 of betaine (Weigel et al., 1986) and an apparently incremental increase in the activity of two enzymes involved in Cho synthesis and a third involved in Cho oxidation. This seemingly correlated set of changes may simply be coincidental, or more detailed biochemical studies of these enzymes and molecular genetic studies of the genes encoding these enzymes may reveal a mechanism that coordinates the rate of Cho synthesis to that of its oxidation to betaine. Such a coordinating mechanism may be critica1 for plants that accumulate betaine, since these plants are conceivably di- verting Cho away from its essential use in phospholipids toward an ancillary role in stress adaptation.
