(Leguminosae-Papil-ionoideae) is a Northeastern Brazilian shrub, called “raiz-de-cobra” (snake root) and used by people for treatingsnake bites1. Two prenylated pterocarpans, cabenegrins A-I(1) and A-II (2)2, potent antidotes against snake venom,were isolated and identified from a locally well knownanti-snake bite medicine named “Específico Pessoa”,manufactured and sold in the north and northeast of Braziland available to plantation workers as an oral antidote. Theplant, commonly called “cabeça de negro”, which furnishesthe extract used in the preparation of this remedy has notbeen identified so far, being kept secret by the manufactur-ers. There are about ten plants with the name “cabeça denegro” in South America. Two plants reputed as anti-snakebite medicines occur in the Ibiapaba region in NortheastBrazil: Bredemeyera floribunda Willd (Polygalaceae),called “pacari”, and Harpalyce brasiliana (Leguminosae-Papilionoideae). The first contains as its active principleone saponin, bredemeyeroside3.In this paper we report the isolation and characterizationof the new isoflavone harpalycin (3) and the known fla-vonol quercetin (4), prenylated pterocarpan (5) and triter-pene betulinic acid (6) from leaves and roots of a specimenof Harpalyce brasiliana. There are three previous chemicalreports about this plant4-6.Results and DiscussionChromatographic separation of the ethanol extract fromthe leaves of Harpalyce brasiliana led to the isolation ofthe new isoflavone harpalycin (3), as well as the knownflavonol quercetin (4). From the roots, 3-hydroxy-4-isopentenyl-8,9-methylenedioxypterocarpan (5) and pen-tacyclic triterpenoid betulinic acid (6) were isolated.The known natural products quercetin (4, 5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxyflavonol) and betulinic acid [6, 3β-hydroxy-20(29)-lupen-28-oic acid] were identified mainly by their1H and 13C-NMR spectra and comparison with literaturedata7,8. 3-Hydroxy-4-isopentenyl-8,9-methylenedioxyp-terocarpan (5) has been recently reported5,6.Comparative analysis of the hydrogen broad band de-coupled (HBBD) and distortionless enhancement by polari-zation transfer (DEPT) 13C-NMR spectra9 of 3,  incombination with the 1H-NMR (one- and two-dimensional1Hx1H-COSY), IR [ν 3420 (OH), 1660 (conjugated car-bonyl), 1620 (conjugated double bond), 1590 and 1500cm-1 (aromatic ring)] and mass {m/z 382 ([M]+, 70 %), 364([M - H2O]+, 12 %), 349 ([M - H2O - Me.]+, 39 %), 311 (3c,[M - C4H7O]+, 100 %), 310 (3d, [M - C4H8O]+, 45 %) andArticle*This work is part of the M.Sc.

Braz. Chem. Soc.The location of hydroxy group at carbon atom CH-3’’of the 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpyran moietywas deduced by signals at δH 3.69 (dd, J = 6.8 and 5.6 Hz)and 5.12 (dd, J = 5.1 and 4.7 Hz), observed in the 1H-NMRspectra of 3 and 3a, respectively (Table 1), whose attribu-tion was confirmed by a long range heteronuclear correla-tion (spin-spin interaction) of the signal at δC 69.76(CH-3’’) and signals at δH 1.37 (3H-5’’, 3JCH) and δH 1.32(3H-6’’, 3JCH), observed in the 2D 13Cx1H-COSY nJCH (n= 2 and 3, COLOC)10 spectrum of the monoacetyl deriva-tive 3a (Table 2). This spectrum also showed correlation ofthe signals corresponding to the hydrogen of the hydroxygroup at C-5 (δH 13.13) and quaternary carbon atoms C-5(δC 160.11, 2JCH), C-6 (δC 102.72, 3JCH) and C-10 (δC105.39, 3JCH), as summarized in Table 2. Additional longrange heteronuclear correlations observed in the 2D13Cx1H-COSY-nJCH (n = 2 and 3, COLOC) spectrum of 3aare summarized in Table 2, along with the heteronucleardirect one bond coupling revealed by the 2D 13Cx1H-COSY-1JCH spectrum of 3a (Table 1). Thus, the completeassignment of the chemical shifts of hydrogen and carbonatoms of 3a in the 1H and 13C-NMR spectra was accom-plished by 2D 1Hx1H-COSY and 13Cx1H-COSY nJCH (n =2 and 3, COLOC), which confirmed the proposed structure3 (Table 1 and 2). These assignments were facilitated byapplication of the usual shift parameters and the observedmultiplicities of signals9.Thus, the structure of the new isoflavone, named harpa-lycine, isolated from Harpalyce brasiliana was establishedas 3*,4-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-7-(3,4-methylenedi-oxyphenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-2H,6H-benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dipyran-6-one (3, 3’’*,5-dihydroxy-2’’,2’’-dimethyl-3’,4’-methylenedioxy-6,7:6’’,5’’-pyranoisoflavone).Relatively few dihydrohydroxypyranoisoflavones havebeen described as natural products11,12.ExperimentalGeneral experimental proceduresMps are uncorr.

The residue (55 g) of the fraction eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (1:1) was suspended in EtOH-H2O soln and ex-tracted with hexane; the residue (23 g) thus obtained waschromatographed on a silica gel column and eluted withhexane, CHCl3, EtOAc and MeOH; the fraction eluted withCHCl3 (2 g) was recrystallized from MeOH to afford 3 (286Table 2.
