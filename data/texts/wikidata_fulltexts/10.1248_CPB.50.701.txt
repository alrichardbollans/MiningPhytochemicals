The Rubiaceae family is well known for containing an-
thraquinones. Our previous research on a Rubiaceaous plant,
Putoria calabrica (L. fil) DC resulted in the isolation of iri-
doid, flavonoid and lignan glycosides.1,2) Further investiga-
tion of the methanolic extract of the plant furnished four an-
thraquinone glycosides of lucidin type, 1—4. In this paper,
we present the isolation and structure elucidation of the new
compounds, 1 and 2.
Putorinoside A (1) was obtained as an amorphous red
powder. The positive and negative ion electrospray ionization
(ESI) mass spectra of 1 displayed the pseudomolecular ions,
[M1Na]1 and [M2H]2 at m/z 501 and 477, respectively.
The molecular formula of C22H22O12 was derived from high
resolution (HR)-FAB-MS ([M1H]1, m/z 479.1183,
D50.7 mmu). An unsaturation number of 12, deduced from
the MS and 13C-NMR data (Table 1), suggested the presence
of four rings. The UV spectrum of 1 showed absorption
bands at lmax 268, 304 (sh), 345 and 432 nm, indicative of an
anthraquinone structure. 1 further displayed IR bands at nmax
3400 (broad), 1668 and 1641 cm21 for hydroxyl group(s) and
unchelated and chelated carbonyl functions, respectively. The
13C-NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, Table 1) contained signals
for all 22 carbons. Sixteen signals were accounted for by the
anthraquinone aglycone, among them four signals belonging
to aromatic carbons bearing an oxygen atom (d 150.0, 151.5,
160.4, 160.6), two signals belonging to a p-quinone moiety
(d 179.0, 187.9), and two belonging to oxygenated aliphatic
carbons (d 51.9, 62.6). The distortionless enhancement by
polarization transfer (DEPT)-135 experiment indicated that
the latter signals were due to an oxymethylene (d 51.9 t) and
a methoxyl (d 62.6 q) group. Also present were signals be-
longing to the six carbons of a hexose unit within 1. All these
data revealed that 1 was an anthraquinone glycoside with two
hydroxy, one methoxy and one oxymethylene substituents.
The 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1, DMSO-d6) contained, for
the aglycone moiety, two doublets at d 7.20 and 7.58 (each
representing 1H, J58.0 Hz), an aromatic proton singlet at d
7.75 (1H), a complex multiplet of 2H at d 4.60, a methoxy
function (d 3.82) and two D2O-exchangeable protons (broad,
OH) at d 10.6 and d 12.4. The sugar moiety demonstrated an
anomeric proton signal at d 5.10 as a doublet (J57.8 Hz),
four overlapping protons between d 3.24—3.40 and an
oxymethylene group at d 3.53 (dd, J54.5, 11.0 Hz) and 3.70
(dd, J52.0, 11.0 Hz). From this data, associated with the 13C-
NMR data, it was obvious that the sugar unit was b-glucopy-
ranose. The site of glycosylation and the substitution pattern
of the anthraquinone aglycone could be deduced by two-
dimensional (2D)-NMR experiments, particularly by gradi-
ent heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (gHMBC). The
methoxy protons exhibited a long range coupling with C-1 (d
160.6 s) of ring C, confirming its location on this carbon
atom. Likewise, the long distance correlations from H2-15 (d
4.60 m) to C-2 (d 121.1 s) and C-3 (d 160.4 s) served to po-
sition the hydroxymethyl function at C-2. Upon observation
of a prominent HMBC cross peak between the anomeric pro-
ton (d 5.10, H-19) and C-3, the site of glycosylation was pre-
dicted to be at C-3. This interpretation was confirmed by fur-
ther HMBC correlations between H2-15/C-3 and H-4/C-3.
Thus, the isolated aromatic proton signal at d 7.75 (s) was
ascribed to C-4. The 2JCH and 
3JCH correlations obtained from
H-4 to C-2, C-10, C-13 and C-14 unambigiously proved this
assignment. The C-10 carbonyl carbon (d 187.9) was
deshielded by ca. 9 ppm compared to that of C-9 (d 179.0),
suggesting strong hydrogen bonding with a phenolic hy-
droxyl group.3,4) Thus, C-5 (d 150.0) was recognized to bear
a peri-hydroxyl function to C-10 carbonyl. The chemical
shift of one of the exchangeable protons (d 12.4, br s) further
corroborated this suggestion.3,4) Since two aromatic signals at
d 7.20 (H-7) and d 7.58 (H-8) coupled with the coupling
constant of JAB58.0 Hz, they had to be ortho positioned, and
thus, the second phenolic hydroxyl group (d 10.6, br s, ex-
changeable) had to reside at C-6 (d 151.5). This substitution
was confirmed by 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY)
couplings, and 1H–13C long range correlations (3JCH) between
H-7/C-5, H-7/C-12 and H-8/C-6, H-8/C-9. Based upon these
evidences, 1 was determined to be a new anthraquinone gly-
coside, 2-hydroxymethyl-1-methoxy-3,5,6-trihydroxyanthra-
quinone 3-O-b-glucopyranoside.
Putorinoside B (2) was obtained as an amorphous orange
powder. The positive and negative ion ESI mass spectra of 2
exhibited the pseudomolecular ions, [M1Na]1 and [M2H]2
at m/z 485 and 461, respectively. The molecular formula,
C22H22O11 (m/z 463.1219, 16 amu less than that of 1), was es-
tablished by positive HR-FAB-MS and 13C-NMR spectra
(Table 1). Many of the carbon and proton resonances of 2
were almost identical to those of 1, implying a close similar-
ity in their structures. Significant differences between 1 and 2
in the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 2) were restricted to

Two new lucidin type anthraquinone glycosides, putorinoside A (1) and putorinoside B (2) were isolated
from Putoria calabrica, in addition to two known anthraquinone glycosides, lucidin 3-O-b-glucopyranoside (3)
and lucidin 3-O-primeveroside (4). Based on spectroscopic data, putorinosides A and B were identified as 2-hy-
droxymethyl-1-methoxy-3,5,6-trihydroxyanthraquinone 3-O-b-glucopyranoside and 2-hydroxymethyl-1-methoxy-
3,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone 3-O-b-glucopyranoside, respectively.

the ring A, where one of the phenolic hydroxy groups was re-
placed by an aromatic proton signal (dH 7.41 br s, dC 115.1
d). The upfield shift of the C-10 carbonyl function (d 182.3)
in conjunction with the IR data (1668 cm21, unchelated car-
bonyl function) suggested that the peri-hydroxy group (C-5)
in 1 was absent in 2. Three bond HMBC couplings between
the pairs H-5/C-7, H-5/C-10; H-7/C-5, H-7/C-12; and H-8/C-
6, H-8/C-9 further supported the presence of only one OH
function in ring A, namely at C-6 (d 162.6). Detailed inspec-
tion of the gHSQC, DQF-COSY, and gHMBC data (Fig. 1)
substantiated the structure of 2 as shown. Compound 2 is 2-
hydroxymethyl-1-methoxy-3,6-dihydroxyanthraquinone 3-O-
b-glucopyranoside.
The spectroscopic data for the known glycosides, lucidin
3-O-b-glucopyranoside (3) and lucidin 3-O-primeveroside
(4), showed good accordance to those of previously reported.5)
Experimental
General Experimental Procedures and Plant Material As reported in
previous study.2)
Extraction and Isolation The air-dried and powdered plant material
(90 g) was extracted with MeOH (500 ml32) for 6 h at 45 °C and filtered.
The filtrate was concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The resulting residue was
dissolved in H2O and partitioned with CHCl3. The H2O phase was
lyophilized (15 g, yield 15%) and preadsorbed onto SiO2 (25 g). This mix-
ture was applied to a Si gel column (250 g) using the mixture of CH2Cl2–
MeOH–H2O (80 : 20 : 1, 80 : 20 : 2, 70 : 30 : 3) to give 150 fractions which
were combined into nine fractions, A—J. The isolation studies on the frac-
tions D, E, F, G, I, and J afforded iridoid, lignan and flavonoid glycosides.2)
The subfractions E1, G2—G3 and J2, remained after the isolation of these
compounds, were subjected to repeated chromatography on Sephadex LH-
20 (MeOH) and C18-MPLC (0 to 70% MeOH in H2O) to afford lucidin 3-O-
b-glucopyranoside (3, 7 mg), putorinoside B (2, 11 mg), lucidin 3-O-
primeveroside (4, 33 mg), and putorinoside A (1, 130 mg), respectively.
