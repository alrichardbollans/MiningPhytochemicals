Tropane alkaloids from Schizanthus litoralisMuñoz, O.Piovano, M.Garbarino, J.Hellwing, V.Breitmaier, E.Six new tropane alkaloids have been isolated from the leaves of the endemic Chilian plantSchizanthus litoralis (Solanaceae). The new structures include a new tropanol dimer of itaconic acidtogether with 6?- senecioyloxytropan-3?-methylmesaconate, 6?-cinnamoyloxytropan-3?-methylmesaconate, 6?-senecioyloxytropan-3?-ol and cis-trans N-(4- hydroxyphenethyl) ferulamides.Other known alkaloids were also isolated. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopicmethods.
