Gleditsia sinensis Lam. (Leguminosae) is a saponin-rich plant. Two main types of
fruits can be generated from this plant, namely Gleditsiae Sinensis Fructus (GSF), the
bigger-sized, normal fruit, and Gleditsiae Fructus Abnormalis (GFA), the abnormal fruit
of older or damaged fruits. As they are rich in saponins with antibacterial functions
(1–6), both fruits have been widely used in soaps, shampoos, detergents or toothpastes
in our daily life. Herbal products containing triterpene saponins of G. sinensis are avail-
able in Europe, America, Asia and Africa, and are mainly imported from China where
the herb is dominantly cultivated.

Gleditsiae Fructus Abnormalis and Gleditsiae Sinensis
Fructus are obtained from different developmental sta-
ges of fruits from Gleditsia sinensis Lam. (Leguminosae).
The possible interchangeable usage of the two fruits,
however, has long been very controversial. Here, high
performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode
array detection was developed to explore their chemical
fingerprinting profiles. Besides, the amounts of aglyco-
nes of saponin compounds, echinocystic acid and olea-
nolic acid in both fruits were quantified. The results indi-
cated that there was no significant difference in the
content of aglycones from the two types of fruits. How-
ever, their chromatographic fingerprints showed distinct
characteristics. Therefore, the interchangeable applica-
tion of these fruits has to be taken with a specific precau-
tion.

In the herbal market, the price of GFA is much higher than that of GSF, which is
mainly due to the availability of the latter. Thus, herbal traders suggest replacing GFA
by GSF for daily application (7). Whether the two fruits could be used in similar applica-
tions is still not known. There are many types of triterpenoidal saponins found in GFA
or GSF: about 19 saponins have been isolated and identified, which were also reported
to possess numerous bioactivities (8–13). The aglycones of these saponins were identi-
fied as echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid and were proposed to be active ingredients
in numerous medicinal herbs (14–17). At present, the aglycons of saponin compounds
are considered to be appropriate chemical compounds for the quality control of herbal
medicines, since they are convenient in terms of method development and marker avail-
ability (18–20). Besides, HPLC fingerprint has been considered to be a comprehensive
approach for assessing the quality of herbal medicines (21). Today, this technique is wi-
dely used for quality control and species differentiation of herbs (22, 23). We therefore
employed the HPLC fingerprint and quantitative analysis approaches to reveal the vari-
ation between the two fruits.
EXPERIMENTAL
Chemicals and materials
Twelve herb samples were collected from different geographical regions of China.
Ten batches of GFA and two batches of GSF were collected from the same plants. Plant
materials were authenticated according to their morphological characteristics. Voucher
specimens were deposited in the Centre for Chinese Medicine at Hong Kong University
of Science & Technology, Hong Kong, China.
The chemical standards of echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid were purchased
from the ChromaDex (ChromaDex, USA) and the National Institute for the Control of
Pharmaceutical & Biological Products (NICPBP, China). Their purity was determined to
be over 98 % by normalization of peak areas, as revealed by HPLC-DAD.
Gleditsioside A was isolated from the roots of GFA, and its structure was establi-
shed by comparison of its spectral data (mass spectrum, 1H NMR and 13C NMR) with
the literature data (8, 12). In general, the purity of a chemical marker should be over 98 %,
which could be used for quantification. As for gleditsioside A, the main saponin in the
fruits, used as a marker for HPLC fingerprint, was purified in-house. This chemical was
rather unstable during storage, and the purity was around 95 %. Thus, this chemical
could be used as a reference standard for qualitative HPLC fingerprint only.
HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Merck (Germany) and ultra-pure wa-
ter was prepared using a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore S.A.S., France). Other re-
agents used were of analytical grade.
Preparation of sample solutions
Stock solutions of echinocystic acid, oleanolic acid and gleditsioside A were prepa-
red in concentrations of 1000, 800 and 200 mg L–1, respectively, by accurately weighing

each compound into a volumetric flask and dissolving it in methanol. Stock solutions
were stored at –20 °C.
GFA was pulverized and dried to constant mass and then passed through a 0.25-mm
sieve before use. For fingerprint analysis, 0.1 g of sample was accurately weighed and
placed into a 15-mL Falcon tube and extracted with 10 mL 25 % methanol in an ultra-
sonic bath for 30 min. The solution was filtered through a 0.45-mm Millipore filter before
injection of 10 mL into the HPLC.
For quantitative analysis, 0.5 g of herbal powder was accurately weighed and pla-
ced into a 250-mL round-bottomed flask, reflux was extracted with 25 mL of methanol
for 30 min, the solution was transferred into a 50-mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at
4,000 x g for 5 min. Ten mL of the supernatant was pipetted into a 250-mL round-bot-
tomed flask and concentrated to dryness under vacuum using a rotary evaporator. The
residue was dissolved in 10 mL of diluted hydrochloric acid/ethanol solution and reflux
was extracted for 30 min. After cooling, the solution was transferred into a 15-mL centri-
fuge tube and centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the
residue was transferred to a 25-mL volumetric flask and made up to the mark with me-
thanol. The solution was filtered through a 0.45-mm Millipore filter before HPLC analy-
sis.
Apparatus and chromatographic conditions
The HPLC system consisted of an Agilent 1200 binary pump (Agilent, Germany), an
auto sampler and a DAD detector at 210 nm for all analyses. Chromatographic separa-
tion was carried out on an Alltima C18 column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 mm). For fingerprint
analysis, the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (A) and water (B) using the following
gradient program: 0–60 min, 25.0–40.0 % A. A pre-equilibration period of 10 min was
used between individual runs. For quantitative analysis, the mobile phase consisted of
acetonitrile and water using the following gradient program: 0–10 min, 65.0 % A, 10–20
min, 65.0–85.0 % A, 20–30 min, 85 % A. A pre-equilibration period of 10 min was used
between individual runs. The column temperature was 25 oC with a flow rate of 1.0 mL
min–1 at 210 nm and the injection volume of 10 mL.
For the MS analysis, an Agilent QQQ-MS/MS (6410B, Germany) equipped with an
ESI (electrospray ionization) ion source was operated in positive ion mode. The drying
gas, nitrogen temperature and flow were 325 °C and 10 L min–1, respectively, nebulizer
pressure was 241 kPa, capillary voltage 4.0 kV; delta electro multiplier voltage 400 V.
Agilent Mass Hunter workstation software version B.01.00 was used for data acquisition
and processing.
Method validation (18, 19, 24)
Linearity. – Linearity was established by injection of 10 mL of mixed standard solu-
tion at six different concentrations. Calibration curve was plotted subsequently based on
linear regression analysis of the integrated peak vs. concentration (mg mL–1). Each cali-
bration curve included six data points.

Pharm. 63 (2013) 505–515.
Limit of detection and limit of quantification. – The limits of detection (LOD) and quan-
tification (LOQ) were determined at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3 and 10, respec-
tively.
Precision. – The precision of the method was validated by determining of intra- and
inter-day variability. The intra- and inter-day precision was determined by analyzing six
replicates of the standard solution of the two analytes during a single day and six repli-
cates of the sample examined on 3 successive days, respectively. The relative standard
deviation (RSD) was taken as a measure of intermediate precision.
Recovery. – A recovery test was used to evaluate the accuracy of method. An exact
amount of each standard was added to accurately weighed 0.5 g of GFA (sample C),
which was then extracted and analysed as described. For comparison, a blank sample
(not spiked with standard compounds) was prepared and analyzed.
HPLC fingerprinting. – In HPLC fingerprinting, a well resolved peak corresponding
to an available chemical reference substance can be used as a marker peak for the calcu-
lation of RRTs (relative retention times) of other peaks in the same chromatogram. The
RRT of a characteristic peak is calculated retention time of a chosen marker peak. For
positive identification, the sample must give all characteristic peaks with the RRTs fall-
ing within the acceptable range.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Extraction procedure and chromatographic conditions
The contents of echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid (Fig. 1a) were determined in a
hydrochloric acid hydrolysed herbal extract. Fig. 1b shows a typical HPLC profile of mi-
xed standards and an extract of GFA or GSF at 210 nm. In order to obtain a quantitative
extraction of analytes from GFA or GSF, the variables involved in the extraction proce-
dure were optimized. Different extraction solvents (methanol, 70 % methanol, absolute
ethanol and 70 % ethanol) and different concentrations of hydrochloric acid/50 % etha-
nol (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mol L–1 HCl) were tested. Extraction by methanol and hydrolysis by
2 mol L–1 HCl/50 % ethanol were found to be optimal (Fig. 2). Different ratios of aceto-
nitrile/water and methanol/water were investigated for the optimal mobile phase, and
the quantitative analysis was achieved by gradient elution using a binary mixture of ace-
tonitrile and water.
Method validation
Linearity. – Linearity was observed in the concentration range 1.0–800 µg mL–1 for
echinocystic acid and 1.9–1000 mg mL–1 for oleanolic acid. Calibration curves depict ex-
cellent correlations for echinocystic acid (R2 = 0.9998) and oleanolic acid (R2 = 0.9990).
LOD and LOQ. – The LODs for two analytes were 0.05 and 0.06 mg mL–1. Their
LOQs were 1.00 and 1.50 mg mL–1, respectively.

Pharm. 63 (2013) 505–515.
Precision. – Precise values evaluated on model samples were as follows. The intra-
-day RSD values for two analytes were 0.7 and 0.4 % (n = 6), and inter-day RSD values
were 3.8 and 3.4 %, respectively (n = 6) (Table I).
Recovery. – The average recoveries (n = 6) for echnocystic acid and oleanolic acid
were 95.8 ± 2.3 % and 93.2 ± 2.2 %, respectively (Table I).
Results indicated that the developed HPLC-DAD method was precise, accurate and
sensitive enough for simultaneous quantitative evaluation of echinocystic acid and olea-
nolic acid in GFA.
Determination of echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid
The validated HPLC-DAD method was applied to quantify two chemical markers,
echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid, in 12 batches of samples. The results of quantitative
analyses are summarized in Table II. We found that GSF (K and L) contained both echi-
nocystic acid and oleanolic acid. The average contents of echinocystic acid for GFA and
GSF were 19.76 ± 4.52 and 19.70 ± 1.67 g kg–1, respectively, while those of oleanolic acid
were 21.25 ± 1.95 g kg–1 and 15.38 ± 0.86 g kg–1, respectively. As described, GSF (K and

L) and GFA (E and J) were collected from the same plants, yet the amount of aglycons
hydrolyzed from saponins was different. Specifically, GFA (E) with echinocystic acid to
oleanolic acid ratio was 1.1, while GSF (K) with two markers ratio was 1.3. Likewise, the
ratios of two markers were 1.0 and 1.3, respectively. These results suggested a different
ratio of saponins contained in two different types of fruits: GSF contained a higher ratio
of echinocystic acid-type saponins to oleanolic acid-type ones than GFA. Similarly, GFA
contained a higher ratio of oleanolic acid-type saponins to echinocystic acid-type ones
than GSF. We speculated that these different ratios of both analytes in two fruits, this
might be due to the different developmental stages of the fruit. A research for saponins
by Xia et al. (24) reported that the contents in GFA were higher than that in GSF, and
their ratios were 2.4 : 1.8 : 0.9 : 1.0 and 2.3 : 2.3 : 1.0 : 1.0 for GFA and GSF, respectively.
Indeed, a research by Li and Hu (25) reported that the amount of oleanolic acid decrea-
sed during the development of fruits. However, further study should be conducted to
investigate how these two analytes changed in the fruits.

a The inter-day analysis refers to six replicates of the sample examined on three consecutive days.
Although the literature demonstrates that echinocystic acid, one of the aglycones,
was employed to quantitatively control the quality of GFA (26, 27), previous methods,
especially for sample preparation, were time-consuming, i.e. around 20 hours. Besides,
hazardous solvents such as chloroform were used in the extraction. In comparison with
these methods, our current method is simpler and more practical to control the quality
of the fruits. For instance, the preparation procedure could be done within 3 hours.
Moreover, less hazardous solvent was employed in this study.
HPLC fingerprint analysis
In order to clarify the chemical properties of the two fruits, chromatograms of dif-
ferent samples were generated. The process of standardization included the selection of
»characteristic peaks« in chromatograms and normalization of retention times of all cha-
racteristic peaks. Gleditsioside A, one of the major saponins found in both fruits, was
used as the reference standard in the fingerprint analysis. Due to similar physicoche-
mical properties of saponins, in this paper we identified the reference peak in samples
by comparing the HPLC retention time and MS data in positive mode with the reference
standard. In the MS spectra of samples, the molecular ion of [M+Na]+ at m/z 1643.0 was
deduced from gleditsioside A, which further confirmed the identity of gleditsioside A
(Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the chromatograms of both fruits from different regions
contained 5 characteristic peaks. Among these peaks, gleditsioside A (peak 5), which

eluted at a retention time of 54.7 min, was chosen as the marker peak. The relative reten-
tion time (RRT) of the 5 characteristic peaks with reference to peak 5 (gleditsioside A)
were: for peak 1 (0.42 ± 0.11), 2 (0.57 ± 0.02), 3 (0.77 ± 0.06), 4 (0.94 ± 0.02). The RSD val-
ues of RRTs of the 5 peaks in 12 sample batches were less than 3.0 %, which confirmed
the high stability and reproducibility of the fingerprints.
In the hierarchical clustering analysis, method called average linkage between
groups was applied, and Pearson correlation was selected as measurement. The result is
shown in Fig. 3c. The tested populations of fruits were divided into two main clusters:
samples A-J (GFA) as cluster one and samples K and L (GSF) as cluster two. This cluster-
ing agreed well with the results of two distinct types of fruits. The results here suggested
that the difference between two fruits might be the result from the different ratios of sa-
ponins between two developmental stages. This is in agreement with the study report-
ing that saponin contents could be changed due to the developmental stages of herbs
(25).
Both fruits were recognized as the same herbal medicine in Compendium of Materia
Medica by Li Shizhen in the Ming dynasty (A.D. 1578) of China. However, GFA was de-

scribed as a drug of higher quality than GSF. Nowadays, they are recorded as different
medicinal drugs in Chinese pharmacopoeia (18). In line with this, the study by Xiao (28)
has suggested that GFA and GSF cannot be substitutes for each other because of the dif-
ference of their growth habitats as well as their chemical compositions.
As regards to the content of total saponins, no significant difference was found be-
tween GFA and GSF (26, 29). Total amounts of four saponins, including gleditsioside A,
gleditsioside B, gleditsioside D and gleditsioside I were 52.7 and 52.4 mg g–1 for GFA
and GSF, respectively (24). However, some findings revealed that there were differences
between two fruits when comparing the amount of echinocystic acid and metals, i.e., Cu,
Zn, Fe, Mn, Mg, K and Ca, as well as their antibacterial effect (26, 30). Here, we found
that the chemical fingerprints of both fruits are rather different, and therefore the inter-
changeable usage of GFA and GSF as a medicine should be undertaken with precaution,
unless full chemical composition has been revealed.
CONCLUSIONS
The established HPLC-DAD method was found to be accurate and precise enough
to be adopted for routine quality control of GFA and GSF. GSF was found to be very sim-
ilar to GFA in the content of echinocystic acid and oleanolic acid. On the other hand,
HPLC fingerprinting revealed a different ratio of echinocystic acid to oleanolic acid type
saponins. Further chemical and pharmaceutical study should be conducted to reveal
whether GFA might be replaced by GSF in clinical applications.
