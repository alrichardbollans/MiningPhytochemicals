O padrão de fragmentação de uma série homóloga de alcalóides piperidínicos isolados de
Senna spectabilis foi investigado utilizando-se espectrometria de massas tandem com ionização
por electrospray (ESI-EM/EM). A análise dos extratos EtOH e frações das flores e dos frutos
de S. spectabilis por ESI-EM e ESI-EM/EM permitiu elucidar a estrutura de quatro componentes
pertencentes a uma série homóloga destes alcalóides, bem como de quatro co-metabólitos
inéditos. A elucidação estrutural dos co-metabólitos, com base no padrão de fragmentação de
alcalóides piperidínicos previamente isolados, e confirmados pelos dados de EM de alta
resolução, demonstra a importância desta técnica para a determinação do “perfil metabolômico”
de uma espécie de importância farmacológica.
The fragmentation pattern of a homologous series of piperidine alkaloids isolated from S.
spectabilis was investigated using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/
MS). The ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses of EtOH extracts and fractions from flowers and
fruits of S. spectabilis allowed to elucidate the structures of four new compounds. The
identification of these co-metabolites, based on the fragmentation patterns of previously isolated
compounds, and further confirmed by accurate mass spectrometry defines this technique as a
powerful tool to determine the “metabolomic profile” of species which has pharmacological
importance.

Introduction
Senna spectabilis (synonym of Cassia spectabilis) is an
arborous species of Fabaceae (subfamily Caesalpiniaceae).
In Brazil, many species of both Cassia and Senna are used
as ornamental plants due to their beautiful flowers. Some
species of are also commonly used in Africa and Asia
countries, mainly in India and China, as traditional medicine
formulations for treatment of several diseases, alternatively
to the conventional allopathic medicine.1,2 Phenolic
compounds have been proposed to be responsible for several
pharmacological properties attributed to these species, such
as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, laxative, antimicrobial and
antiulceral.3 Recently, leaves and flowers of S. spectabilis
were reported to be valuable sources of bioactive piperidine
alkaloids (Figure 1). Recently the cytotoxicity of these
metabolites was reported using mutant strains of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is indicative of their
potential antitumoral activity.3 Interestingly, further assays
with these alkaloids demonstrated significant antinociceptive
activity, and also revealed them as acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors.4,5 Also, it was attributed to piperidine alkaloids,
purgative,6,7 and antimicrobial8 activities, as well as the ability
for specific inhibition of superoxide macrofages.9 Considering
1432 Pivatto et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
these remarkable pharmacological properties, there is an
interest in searching for further piperidine alkaloids from S.
spectabilis, including major and minor alkaloid co-
metabolites. However, these alkaloids are biosynthesized by
this plant species in very small amounts, and it has not been
possible to obtain sufficient pure material for full structural
determination using NMR techniques. Therefore, no detailed
structural information for these alkaloids co-metabolites is
available.
In recent years, liquid chromatography (LC) coupled
to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has
been shown to be a powerful tool to separate and identify
natural products.10-12 Structural elucidation of natural co-
metabolites in complex mixtures has also been possible by
use of electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS/MS), even from small quantities of plant material
or other biological samples.13,14 The use of this technique
has increased substantially nowadays, and ESI-MS/MS
experiments can be useful for various studies on natural
product chemistry, including biosynthesis,15-18 metabolomic
profile19,20 and dereplication.13,21,22 The isolation and
characterization of several alkaloids have been reported,
however, only a handful of papers describe the use of ESI-
MS/MS for the characterization of new natural products.11,23-27
Advances in the development of high-resolution MS and
the elucidation of gas-phase fragmentation chemistry is now
helping in the analysis of new compounds and new organic
reactions.28-32
In this study, we report a ESI-MS/MS spectrometric
method for characterization of piperidine alkaloids from
flowers and fruits extracts of S. spectabilis. This technique
is also shown to be an excellent tool for analysis of the
different alkaloid isomers co-metabolites as a homologous
series, which constitutes the chemical profile or
“fingerprint” in whole tissues. Additionally, a simple and
rapid method for differentiation and identification of known
alkaloid mixtures, and also of new piperidine analogs can
be useful to describe the metabolomic design from different
part of this plant species.
Experimental
Plant material
The flowers and fruits of S. spectabilis were collected
in February 2004 from a specimen cultivated at the
Institute of Chemistry in Araraquara, São Paulo State,
Brazil, and identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro. A voucher
specimen (SP 370.917) was deposited at the herbarium of
the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, São Paulo – SP, Brazil.
Extraction and sample preparation
Green fruits and dried flowers from S. spectabilis (8.0
kg and 950.0 g, respectively) were powdered and extracted
(5 x 5 L) with EtOH. The ethanolic extracts (2.0 g) of
both green fruits and dried flowers were re-dissolved in
5% aqueous H2SO4 (30 mL) and the insoluble portion was
filtered off. The acid solution was extracted with hexane
(3 x 20 mL) to yield a non-alkaloidal portion (14.8 from
fruits and 5.7 mg from flowers). The residual acid solution
was basified (pH 9) with NH4OH, then extracted with
CH2Cl2 (3 x 20 mL). The resulting extracts were dried
over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated, furnishing a
crude alkaloidal fraction from fruits (121.6 mg) and
flowers (272.7 mg).
An aliquot of each extract was dissolved in MeOH to
obtain a concentration of 1 mg mL-1 and decanted during
12 h. The samples were filtered and clean up in a solid-
liquid extraction, using a Gelman’s polytetrafluorethylene
membrane (PTFE) of 0.45 μm in diameter.
Mass spectrometry
Methanol (HPLC grade) and de-ionized water (Milli-
Q) was used throughout the whole study. ESI mass spectra,
precursor and product ions scans were acquired in positive
ion mode at unit mass resolution and recorded on a
Quattro-LC spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK)
which held a quadrupole, hexapole quadrupole configu-
ration. The instrumental conditions used were: probe
electrospray tip voltage 3 kV; cone voltage 25 V; nitrogen
was used for both the bath and nebulizing gas flowing at
345 L h-1 and 27 L h-1, respectively. Solutions were infused

into the ESI source at a flow-rate of 5 μL min-1, using a
Harvard Apparatus model 1746 (Holliston, MA).
Compounds and cleaned up extracts were dissolved in
20% aqueous methanol to give a concentration of 0.5 mg
mL-1 and 10 μL were injected for each analysis. The source
temperature was set at 80 oC.
Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS/MS) experiments were carried out in positive
ion mode only, using the same conditions described above.
The collision cell was filled with Ar gas at pressure of 7
psi and the collision energy was fixed at 25 eV to maximize
the formation of diagnostic fragments.
Accurate-mass measurements were performed on a
quadrupole-time of flight instrument (UltrOTOF-Q,
Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA).
Results and Discussion
ESI-MS/MS data of the protonated molecule 2, 3, 5
and 7 (Figure 1), which were previously isolated,3,5 are
shown in Table 1. The product ion mass spectra of 2 (of m/z
326) and 7 (of m/z 368), that only differ in the lateral chain
linked at C-6 of the piperidine ring, are very similar. The
most abundant fragment ion for both the spectra is that of
m/z 308, which results from H2O loss (18 Da) or CH3CO2H
loss (60 Da), respectively from the precursor ion.
Additionally, less abundant fragment ions at the low m/z
region, of m/z 70, 81, 95, are also of very similar abundances
for 2 and 7. Similarly, the predominant process in the
fragmentation of 5 (of m/z 342) is the loss of H2O. For 5,
however, further loss of H2O (from [M + H - H2O]+) forms
the ion of m/z 306. This difference is likely associated with
the hydroxyl group at C-7, thus allowing for the second
loss of H2O. In addition, the fragment ion of m/z 280 also
can be considered diagnostic for the hydroxyl substituent
at C-7, and it is observed only for 5. Finally, similarities
between the fragment ions of the diasteroisomers 2 and 3,
of m/z 326, indicate that the configuration at C-6 has little
influence on their dissociation pattern. These data
demonstrate that the loss of H2O at C-3 (for 2, 3 and 5 or
CH3CO2H, for 7) is the predominant process in the
fragmentation of protonated piperidine alkaloids. In
addition, the fragment ion [M + H - R2OH - H2O]+, together
with that of m/z 280, is considered to be also diagnostic of
a hydroxyl group at C-7.
ESI-MS of crude alkaloidal fraction of flowers and
fruits from S. spectabilis are shown in Figures 2 and 3,
respectively. In order to investigate the structure of various
alkaloid co-metabolites, a series of ions with even m/z
relative value, that are usually characteristic for protonated
molecules containing odd number of nitrogens,32-34 were
analyzed by ESI tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS),
as shown in Table 1.
Loss of H2O is the predominant process in the
fragmentation of the ion of m/z 298 (1). Other minor ions
are those of m/z 70, 81, 95 and 109. These ESI-MS/MS
data are similar to those of 2 and 3, with a m/z shift of 28
regarded to the corresponding ions of m/z 298 and 280 (of
m/z 326 and m/z 308, respectively). This shift is attributed
to two methylenes units at the alkyl side chain at C-6.

Therefore, 1 is expected to be homologue of 2 and 3
differing only in the number of CH2 units of the substituent
at C-6 (n = 8 for 1; n = 10 for 2 and 3). A similar alkaloid
was previously isolated from Cassia excelsa.35 However,
the configuration of the stereocenters of the alkaloid core
(C-2, C-3, and C-6) could not be unambiguously assigned
as their influences on the fragmentation processes were
not evident in this study.
The second most abundant fragment ion of 6, of m/z
280, is resulting of loss of CH3CO2H (60 Da), as compared
to 7. Further similarities between the ESI-MS/MS data of
6 and 7 (i.e., the low mass fragment ions series at m/z 70,
81, 95 and 109), that differ by 28 m/z units, are indicative
of the lack of two methylene units for 6, as compared to 7
(Table 1). It appears to be no previous reports on this
compound or on its diasteroisomers. In the same manner,
ESI-MS/MS of the ion of m/z 314 (4) shows fragment
ions of m/z 296 (loss of H2O) and m/z 278 (loss of two
H2O molecules) with a mass shift of 28 as for 5 (of m/z
324 and m/z 306, respectively). These data indicated that
4 is a (CH2)8 homologue of 5 (Figure 1), previously isolated
from Cassia leptophylla.5
The two major fragment ions in the ESI-MS/MS
spectrum of m/z 328 (9), of m/z 310 and m/z 292, result
from two consecutive losses of H2O (Table 1). In principle,
they could be indicative of a hydroxyl substituent at C-7,
similar to 5. However, for 9 the lack of the fragment ion of
m/z 280 (which is diagnostic for the hydroxyl substituent
at C-7), as well as the two m/z shift units from the
corresponding ion of 3, are strong evidences for a hydroxyl
group bounded in another position of the alkaloid skeleton,
most probably formed by the reduction of the carbonyl
group on the side chain linked at C-6. This data suggests
that 9 is similar to an alkaloid previously isolated from
Cassia spectabilis.5 Finally, comparison between the ESI-
MS/MS of 8 (of m/z 300) and 9 (of m/z 328), that also
displays a m/z shift of 28, suggests that 8 exhibits an alkyl
side chain with n = 8 instead of n = 10 (for 9). Such
compound (8) has been previously isolated from C.
spectabilis.3,5
The fragment ion of m/z 280 in the ESI-MS/MS of 10
(m/z 444) results from the loss of a 164 Da, likely R2OH
(Table 1). An analogous fragment ion is also observed in
the spectra of 1 and 6 (n = 8). However, for 10 the ion of

1435Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Screening of Piperidine AlkaloidsVol. 16, No. 6B, 2005
m/z 280 can also be formed by loss of H2O. In addition,
the relative abundance of the fragment ion of m/z 147
(that was expected to be diagnostic for the R2 substituent
group at C-3), is higher than those of the low mass
fragment ions series of m/z 70, 81, 95 and 109, whose
intensity is much lower than that of their corresponding
ions in the spectra of 1-9, thus suggesting a
phenylpropanoid moiety linked at C-3. The fragment ions
of m/z 147 and ([M + H - 146]+ has been recently used to
characterize a p-coumaroyl substituent (Figure 1).35 The
fragment ion of m/z 147 is considered to result from
charge-induced fragmentation that forms an acylium ion
E (pathway III, Scheme 1). This process could be initiated
by proton shift from the amine group to the carbonyl of
the ester group.36 In contrast, loss of p-coumaric acid
(pathway II), as well as the formation of the fragment ion

1436 Pivatto et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
of m/z 298 (pathway I) requires two different hydrogen
shifts that do not involve the charged site.37 A literature
search indicates that there are no previous reports for
alkaloid 10.
ESI-MS/MS of the ion of m/z 474 (12), shown in Figure
4, differ from that of 10 (m/z 444) only by the product ion of
m/z 177, which is 30 m/z units heavier than that for 10 (m/z
147). This difference indicates an additional methoxyl group
at the aromatic moiety, that is, a feruloyl group.23 Further
evidence of a methoxyl group is given by the diagnostic ion
of m/z 145, formed by the loss of CH3OH from E (Table 1).
In addition, other similarities between the spectra of 10 and
12 (i.e., the low mass fragment ion series of m/z 70, 81, 95
and 109) are coherent with the proposed structure 12, which
appears to be novel (Figure 1).
The ESI-MS/MS of the ion of m/z 472 (11) shows the
fragment ions of m/z 326 and m/z 308 with a 28 m/z shift
as compared to the corresponding ions of 10. However,

most of the fragment ions of 11 are the same as those of
10, including that of m/z 147, which is indicative of the
p-coumaroyl group. These data strongly indicate that 11
differ from 10 only by two additional CH2 units at the
side chain at C-3 (n = 10 for 11 instead of n = 8 for 10). In
fact, comparison between ESI-MS/MS of 12 and 13
(Figure 4) reveals that 13 is similar to 12 differing only in
the length of the side chain at C-6 (n = 10). As for 10 and
12, there are no reports found for 11.
Aiming to confirm further the structures of all
piperidine alkaloids, which were identified in this study,
accurate-mass measurements were performed (Table 2).
For 10-13, the fragment ions of m/z 145 (10, 11) and m/z
177 (12, 13) corroborate the presence of a phenylpropanoid
moiety (feruloyl or coumaroyl) at C-3 for these alkaloid
co-metabolite series. All of the measured m/z are in full
agreement with those calculated for the proposed formula.
Analysis of S. spectabilis profile’s from fruits and
flowers extracts revealed a predominance of alkaloids with
n = 8, unlike previous results, for which the compounds
with n = 10 were the predominant.3 Our results also showed
that the co-metabolites identified from flower extracts are
more oxidized that those from fruits. The preferential
accumulation of co-metabolites exhibiting different
oxidation levels is likely to be associated with cellular
differentiation in flowers tissues. We believe that this result
could be of interest for further biosynthetic studies from
this species.
There are, obviously, a number of structural features of
the alkaloid skeleton that could not be assigned by mass
spectrometry (i.e., configuration of the stereocenters at C-
2, C-3 and C-6). In the same manner, some minor product
ions and mechanistic aspects of the ion fragmentation
cannot be explained solely from ESI-MS/MS analysis. To
fully elucidate the structures and to understand the ion
fragmentation pathways, additional data from NMR and
MSn are required. Nevertheless, this work demonstrated
the usefulness of ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS assisting on the
preliminary but very fast and considerably reliable
identification of novel and potentially bioactive co-
metabolite alkaloids from Senna species extracts.
