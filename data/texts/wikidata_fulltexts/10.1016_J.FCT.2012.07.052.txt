Mutagenicity and liver toxicity of the herb tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) were evaluated using single
cell gel (comet) electrophoresis. Ten microlitres aliquots of peripheral venous human blood were incu-
bated with tarragon extract, saline, or the mutagen sodium dichromate. Cell suspensions dispersed in
low-melting agarose were electrophoresed in ethidium bromide. The resulting DNA migration trails were
obtained using ﬂuorescent microscopy at 400 magniﬁcation, and graded according to the mutagenicity
index (MI) for each cell incubation condition. The in vivo liver toxicity of Artemisia dracunculus was
assessed in the blood of mice treated orally with the extract of the herb, using alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as liver function indicators. Liver morphology was assessed
using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of liver tissue. The present study demonstrated a direct
correlation between tarragon extract dosage and three major outcome variables: MI; serum liver enzyme
activity; and liver histopathology. These outcomes are possibly due to the presence in tarragon of meth-
ylchavicol and other genotoxic compounds. These ﬁndings provide a preliminary guide for risk assess-
ment of tarragon in diet and in possible therapeutic applications.

791. Introduction
The popularity of herbal preparations for prevention and miti-
gation of disease has increased dramatically in recent years. Their
availability outside most government regulatory statutes and
without prescription as over-the-counter (OTC) products has made
many of them highly cost-effective alternatives to pharmaceutical
drugs (Chan, 2003). Moreover, physicians generally ﬁnd that
patient compliance in following a particular treatment regimen is
substantially better when medicinal plant extracts are recom-
mended, versus that found with ‘‘mainstream’’ remedies. Never-
theless, herbal medicines will have optimal beneﬁt to the public
only if stringent toxicological analysis are conducted incidental
to their clinical use. The present evaluation of tarragon (Artemisia
dracunculus L., or dragon’s wort) is an example of this trend.
Tarragon is a perennial member of the Asteraceae family,
related to the herb wormwood. The herb is widely used as food
seasoning and as a primary ﬂavor for some brands of carbonated
beverages. The plant contains compounds that help alleviate pain
associated with dental conditions, and that promote bile produc-
tion and detoxiﬁcation by the liver, thus aiding digestion, and they80

52may act as a mild sedative (McGufﬁn et al., 1997; Nestler, 2002).
Tarragon may be useful in management of dysregulalated glucose
metabolism, including hyperglycaemia, diabetes, and related
metabolic syndromes (Cefalu et al., 2008; Ribnicky et al., 2009;
Ribnicky et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008). The herb may also prove
useful in the treatment of microbial infections (Benli et al., 2007;
Lopes-Lutz et al., 2008), and has potential as an anticoagulant
(Shahriyary and Yazdanparast, 2007).
The results of the present study will provide insight into the
toxicological proﬁle of this plant and aid physicians and other care-
givers in tailoring its use to be an optimally appropriate element of
medical treatments. The present report evaluates tarragon’s muta-
genic (DNA damaging) capacity. This is important information
since DNA damage reduces cell viability contributing to tissue
damage and is additionally carcinogenic. Several reliable and
widely used mutagenicity tests were considered for use in this
investigation, notably the micronucleus test and the single cell
gel electrophoresis (comet) assay (Collins et al., 1997).
The comet assay was ultimately selected based on its wide use
in research, simplicity and reliability. This assay, also known as the
Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE)-based assay, is applicable for
mutagenicity in determining differential migration patterns by
DNA fragments of varying length, in order to assess the level of
DNA damage to which a cell has been subjected. Typically, blood
incubated with a potential mutagen (in the present case, tarragon
extract) is suspended in agarose and layered onto a microscopeic analysis of Artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) extract. Food Chem. Toxicol.

and other components except for DNA, which remains trapped in
the cavity once occupied by a DNA-containing leukocyte. An elec-
tric ﬁeld is then applied to the slide causing the negatively-charged
DNA to migrate in the direction of the anode (positive electrode).
Undamaged DNA, consisting of long strands, remains mostly
trapped in the cavities, whereas damaged DNA, comprised of much
shorter fragments, migrates out of the cavities in patterns which
appear as extended ‘‘trails upon staining of the slide with ethidium
bromide (EtBr)’’. These migration trails create comet-like patterns
with lengths directly proportional to the degree of DNA fragmenta-
tion induced by a particular mutagen. Use of the comet assay in the
present investigation yielded insight into tarragon’s capacity to
induce DNA damage (Cook and Brazell, 1977; Cook et al., 1976;
Ostling and Johanson, 1984; Ostling et al., 1987; Singh et al.,
1988; Tice et al., 1990, 1991).
Additional toxicological evaluations of the extract were con-
ducted by measuring the activities of toxicant-sensitive liver
enzymes (AST/OT and ALT/PT), along with a histological examina-
tion of hepatic tissue from mice treated with tarragon.174

2.1. Tarragon extract and control reagents
Tarragon extract was purchased from an Iranian manufacturer (Barich Herbal
Pharmaceuticals, Kashan, Iran). The sample used in the present study was drawn
from Health Ministry lot #5569, MOH serial number 10061, barcode
6260084700072. The component proﬁle for this sample may be obtained at request
from the manufacturer (Barich, Kashan).
The preparation of the extract for use as a comet assay reagent was conducted
at the Department of Pharmacognosy of the School of Pharmacy, Ahwaz Jundisha-
pur Medical Science University. Brieﬂy, the preparation protocol utilized an etha-
nol:water maceration method (ratio 7:3). Filtration was performed, and the
resulting ﬁltrates were vacuum-evaporated, followed by a measurement of density
(940 mg/ml) using a pycnometer. The resulting suspension was suitable both for
use as a comet assay reagent, and for oral administration when testing animals in
liver toxicity evaluations. For comet assays, a saline buffer was included as a nega-
tive control; sodium dichromate, a known mutagen, was used as a positive control
to induce DNA fragmentation, an outcome expected to be manifested as long-tailed
comet patterns (Bucher, 2007; Buehrlen et al., 2007; Stout et al., 2009),194

2242.2. Comet assay
Here, comet assays were performed according to the previously described
methodology (Collins, 2002; Kobayashi et al., 1995). Peripheral venous blood was
freshly collected from healthy, non-smoking student volunteers at Jundishapur Uni-
versity, and10 ll aliquots of were added to six numbered 2-ml screw-top tubes,
each containing 1 ml of Hanks Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) and test reagents (tar-
ragon extracts and controls). Four tubes were prepared, containing 94, 188, 376,
and 752 mg tarragon extract at a density of 940 mg/ml. Saline buffer, the negative
control, was added to a ﬁfth tube; 262 mg of sodium dichromate, the positive con-
trol, was added to the sixth tube. Samples containing reagents and blood were incu-
bated in a water bath for 10 min at 37 C, followed by centrifugation for ﬁve
minutes at 3500 rpm. The upper layer was discarded, and the pellet was dispersed
in 100 ll of 0.5% (low melting point) agarose in phosphate buffer.
The resulting cell suspensions were poured onto agarose-coated microscope
slides with cover slips were placed over them. After solidiﬁcation, the coverslips
were removed and the slides were placed in lysis buffer at 4 C for one hour to dis-
solve leukocyte cellular structures, leaving cavities containing cellular DNA. The
prepared slides were then electrophoresed in alkaline buffer for one hour at 25 V
and 300 mA, followed by three 5-min washes with neutral buffer to remove alkali
and detergents (which may interfere with the ethidium bromide dye uptake). Next,
slides were stained with ethidium bromide to label DNA and examined with a ﬂuo-
rescent microscope.
Analysis for mutagenicity of the tarragon extracts was conducted using the
method of Kobayashi et al. (1995), Lankinen and Vilpo (1997), and Tice and Vasquez
(1999). Electrophoresis-induced migration patterns of DNA within the agarose were
graded according to length of the comet ‘‘tail’’ (the trail of DNA fragments originat-
ing at the position of each lysed cell, visible due to staining with EtBr dye). Graded
values for comet tail length were established as follows: Type 1: no migration (NM);
Type 2: short migration (SM); Type 3: medium migration (MM); and Type 4: long
migration (LM). The mutagen indices (MI) of tarragon (test) and control solutionsPlease cite this article in press as: Kalantari, H., et al. Toxicological and mutagen
(2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.07.052were determined as the relative representation of each of the four grades of comet
migration pattern in a sample of cells exposed to a particular solution, according to
the following relationship:

MI ¼ ½0 ðNMÞ þ 1 ðSMÞ þ 2 ðMMÞ þ 3 ðLMÞ
N
; where N
¼ ðNMþ SM þMMþ LMÞ
Numerical values for the variables NM, SM, MM and LM were obtained by
counting the total number of comets in the coverslip-bounded areas on four slides
containing electrophoresed and EtBr-stained agarose suspensions of cells exposed
to a particular test solution or control. Here, N is the sum of comets counted on
all four slides. Tarragon extract density was determined by pycnometer. Stain/lys-
ing solution in neutral buffer was prepared according to the McKelvey-Martin pro-
cedure with negligible modiﬁcation (McKelvey-Martin et al., 1993, 1998; Szeto
et al., 2002). Reagents used in the present study included high purity-grade agarose
(Fluka, Japan), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium dichromate, ethidium bromide,
Triton X-100, disodium EDTA, N-laury/sarcosin sodium salt, and trizma (Sigma, St.
Louis, USA). Major equipment included a Shandon electrophoresis apparatus (Vo-
kan SAE, England), a TJ6 centrifuge (Beckman-Coulter, Brea CA USA), and a ﬂuores-
cent microscope (Helmat Hund, Germany).
2.3. Evaluation of tarragon liver toxicity in mice
2.3.1. Animals
Mice used in the present study experiments were Swiss albino males with an
average weight of approximately 25 ± 5 g. The animals were fed regular rodent
chow ad libitum with free access to water. The animals were allowed 1 week to
acclimatize before the experiments and were kept at 25 ± 2 C, with a relative
humidity of 55 ± 5% and a 12-h light–dark cycle. All animals included in the present
study were handled and received humane care in compliance with the principles of
laboratory animal care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, and published by the National Institutes of Health (Publication
No. NIH 85-23, revised in 1996). All protocols for their use in this investigation were
approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of
Medical Sciences.
2.3.2. Treatment group design
Mice were randomly assigned to ﬁve test groups of eight animals each, based on
dosage of tarragon extract. To determine the existence of a dose-responsive rela-
tionship between tarragon and hepatotoxicity, members of each group were admin-
istered treatments for 7 days in dosages ranging from 0–752 mg/kg, deﬁned as
follows: Group A: drug-free group (normal saline only); Group B: 94 mg/kg tarragon
extract; Group C: 188 mg/kg tarragon extract; Group D: 376 mg/kg tarragon extract;
and Group E: 752 mg/kg tarragon extract. These dose ranges were selected based on
previous evaluation of the capacity of the extract to parameters related to glucose
metabolism, obesity, and diabetes in mouse models (Ribnicky et al., 2009; Watcho
et al., 2010)
2.3.3. Toxicity assessments
On the 8th day after initiation of treatment with extracts or control (saline),
blood was collected from jugular veins of animals and utilized for serum prepara-
tion. The blood samples were left to stand at room temperature for 1 h, and then
centrifuged at 300g for 10 min to obtain the serum used for evaluating liver enzyme
activities. The mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, i.p.)
and sacriﬁced under anesthesia; next, their liver and kidneys were removed and ﬁx-
ated in an ice-cold, PBS/10% formalin solution. Tissue specimens were hematoxylin-
eosin (H & E)-stained and observed under a light microscope. The following three
post-mortem evaluations were then conducted:
(i) Macroscopic examination: All mice were given a complete postmortem
examination (autopsy). The abdominal, thoracic, and cranial cavities were
examined for abnormalities, and the livers were removed, examined, and
ﬁxed in 10% formalin.
(ii) Serum enzyme activities: Test kits purchased from Asan Pharmaceutical
(Seoul, Korea) were used to determine the occurrence toxic effects on liver
function by assessment of tarragon-mediated alteration of ALT and AST
activities. Changes in the activity of these enzymes are considered valid
indicators of the toxicity of a particular agent, and for the purpose of the
present study, were assayed by the method of Reitman and Frankel (1957).
(iii) Histopathologic/microscopic examination: 6 lm-thick histological sections
were prepared from formalin-ﬁxed livers, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)-
stained, and observed under a light microscope. To prepare harvested tissue
for examination by light microscopy, livers were removed, preserved in 10%
neutral phosphate-buffered formalin, and processed by routine parafﬁn
sectioning and staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Staining was
performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions.ic analysis of Artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) extract. Food Chem. Toxicol.

The data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. One-way analysis of variance test
was ﬁrst carried out to test for any differences between the mean values of all
groups. If differences were established, the values of the treated groups were com-
pared with those of the negative and positive control groups, followed by Tukey’s
post-testing using GraphPad Prism 5.01. A change of p < 0.001 between the negative
and positive controls and treated groups was considered to be signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Comet assay
Examination of electrophoresed, EtBr-stained, agarose slides
using ﬂuorescent microscopy at 400 magniﬁcation showed
apparently strong correlation between occurrence of characteristic
DNA migration (comet) patterns and the contents of the solutions
in which cells on a particular slide had been incubated (Fig. 1).
Type 1 comets (no migration – NM) constituted the predomi-
nant form on slides containing blood incubated in a saline buffer
(Fig. 1a, Table 1) with 94 and 188 mg tarragon extract (Fig. 1cFig. 1. DNA fragmentation (comet) patterns resulting from treatment of human blood w

increasingly on slides containing cells incubated with 376 mg of
the extract (Fig. 1e). The ratio of the patterns shifts with Type 3
(medium migration – MM) on slides containing cells treated with
752 mg extract (Fig. 1f); and Type 4 comet pattern (long migration
– LM) was seen in the greatest number on slides with cells incu-
bated in the positive control: 262 mg sodium dichromate (Fig. 1b).
The representation of each grade of DNA migration is shown in
Table 1. Distribution of comet pattern forms was, as expected, pre-
dominantly skewed in favor of Type 1, no migration – NM in slides
containing cells incubated with a saline buffer (negative control);
and with Type 4, long migration – LM on slides with cells stimu-
lated with 262 mg sodium dichromate (positive control). Mutagen
indices (MI), calculated according to the relationship given in Sec-
tion 2 and representing the number of each comet form in a partic-
ular set of four slides, relative to the total number of each comet
type in slides containing cells exposed to a particular stimulant,
exhibited a positive dose-responsive relationship to the dosage of
tarragon extract, ranging from 0.40 ± 0.02⁄ for 94 mg extract to
1.1 ± 0.04⁄ for cells treated with 752 mg (Fig. 2). MI values forith saline (1A), the mutagen sodium dichromate (1B), or selected doses of Tarragon

Histological proﬁles of liver samples were consistent with the
changes of AST and of ALT. The histopathological examination of
the liver sections of the control group (normal saline) showed nor-
mal cellular architecture with distinct hepatic cells and sinusoidal
spaces (Fig. 3A). H&E-stained slides frommice treatedwith tarragon
extract exhibited dose-responsive disruption of tissue microstruc-
ture, including increases in inﬂammatory changes, congestion,
centrilobular necrosis, steatosis, and swelling of hepatic cytoplasm
(3B–3E).322

As expected, DNA migration (comet) patterns observed in slides
containing cells incubated with negative control solution (saline)
were mainly Type 1 (no migration – NM); whereas cells incubated
with 262 mg of sodium dichromate (positive control) exhibited
predominantly Type 4 (long migration – LM) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
These outcomes reﬂected the known behavior of undamaged
DNA consisting largely of long strands that mostly remain trapped
in cavities within the agarose matrix formed by lysis of cellular
material, thereby creating Type 1 patterns, versus fragmented
DNA. That may move out of the cavities in the direction of the elec-
trophoretic electric ﬁeld gradient, revealed as Type 4 comets. The
dose-responsive increase in mutagen index shown in Table 1 and
Fig. 2 indicates that tarragon extract has DNA damaging properties.Please cite this article in press as: Kalantari, H., et al. Toxicological and mutagen
(2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.07.052Although the data presented here does not allow for the devel-
opment of a mechanistic explanation of this phenomenon, it is
likely that one or more compounds found in the plant is reactive
with DNA in ways that cause strand breaks. The plant contains
compounds known to affect a diverse range of homeostatic func-
tions, most notably neurologic and gastrointestinal activity. Its
essential oil is a complex blend of bioactive phytochemicals that
include aromatics, fatty acids, derivatives of isocoumarin (3-(1Z-
butenyl)isocoumarin 3-(1E-butenyl)isocoumarin), and polyacetyl-
enes (capillene, 1-and phenyl-2,4-hexadiene) (Aglarova et al.,
2008). Compounds present at high percentages in the oil include
estragol (methylchavicol), sabinene, and methyleugenol. Tarragon
also contains signiﬁcant quantities of ﬂavonoids such as isorham-
netin, camphorol, quercetin, luteolin, and glycosides of these com-
pounds (Arykova, 1996).
There is wide variability in the content of these and other com-
ponents, depending on growth conditions for the plant at its place
or origin, such as soil composition, salinity, and other environmen-
tal factors (Aglarova et al., 2008). Some tarragon components, such
as polycyclic aromatic compounds, have potential for mutagenicity
based on their structural similarity to DNA bases. Moreover, estra-
gol (methylchavicol), a major component of the plant’s essential
oil, has known genotoxic properties (Nesslany et al., 2010), a phe-
nomenon that may at least partly account for the results of the
present study. Interestingly, another compound in tarragon, capil-
larisin, has been shown to protect against oxidative damage of the
kind that causes DNA fragmentation (Chu et al., 1999).
It is important to emphasize that the data shown here does not
permit for the establishment of mechanistic relationships between
any particular compound previously demonstrated to be a compo-
nent of tarragon and the mutagenic capacity of the herb. Neverthe-
less, future use of tarragon in both diet and healthcare should be
undertaken with an awareness of the major components of theic analysis of Artemisia dracunculus (tarragon) extract. Food Chem. Toxicol.

21 September 2012plant, along with an understanding of its bioactivity and potential
toxicity.
Changes in liver enzyme activity and histopathology, that were
observed to occur dose-responsively in mice administered tarra-
gon extract (Figs. 2 and 3), demonstrated hepatotoxic properties
of the herb. Since the liver acts as a primary line of defense against
toxic insult, most toxicological analysis evaluate the capacity of a
particular agent to adversely affect liver function and tissue integ-
rity. Serum ALT and AST activities are observed to increase signif-
icantly in response to a wide range of toxic agents, and are thus
considered to be reliable indicators of the toxic risk posed by a par-
ticular substance (Taye and Abdel-Raheem, 2012). It is neverthe-
less important to caveat this observation by emphasizing that the
present study was not conducted to determine speciﬁc dose ranges
of tarragon expected to mediate toxicity in humans or other verte-
brates. The data presented here demonstrates only the capacity for
mutagenicity and hepatotoxicity of the herb in two well estab-
lished models. Quantifying the health risk of the herb remains
for future investigations.419

The results of the present study show that tarragon extract
exhibits mutagenic properties. However, the data presented here
is not comprehensive enough to draw deﬁnitive conclusions
regarding its potential risk to human health with sustained use,
particularly as a therapeutic agent. Validation of its safety as a
component of diet and possibly in healthcare is provided by a risk
assessment study conducted in 2010 that conﬁrms the mutagenic-
ity of tarragon, but concludes that consumption of the herb poses a
minimal risk to human health (Nesslany et al., 2010).
Tarragon has been an element of the human diet for centuries,
perhaps millennia; it has also been used extensively in traditional
medicine. Hence, occasional consumption is probably not danger-
ous. Nevertheless, high-dose application of the extract in the treat-
ment of serious disease is not recommended. This was also
conﬁrmed by the enzymological assay, and through immunohisto-
chemical examinations. Any agent capable of damaging DNA is
potentially carcinogenic. Hence, high-doses of tarragon may in-
crease cancer risk, particularly in persons susceptible to cancer
through genetic disposition, disease, or chemical exposure. This re-
port describes a potential adverse effect of tarragon using a Comet
mutagen assay, liver function, and liver morphology assay. The
main conclusion of the present study is that high-dose usage of tar-
ragon may pose health risks based on mutagenic and hepatotoxic
properties observed as a result of the present study.455
