Two new diterpene lactones, phlogacantholides B (1) and C (2), and three new diterpene lactone glucosides,
phlogacanthosides A (3), B (4), and C (5), together with lupeol, â-sitosterol, betulin, â-daucosterol, (+)-
syringaresinol, and (+)-syringaresinol-4-O-â-D-glucopyranoside, were isolated from the roots of Phloga-
canthus curviflorus. Their structures were elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic evidence. The
structure, including the relative configuration of phlogacantholide B (1), was confirmed by X-ray
crystallographic analysis of its diacetate (6).
Phlogacanthus curviflorus (Wall) Nees (Acanthaceae) is
a shrub distributed in Yunnan Province of China as well
as in Vietnam and India.1 Its roots are used for the
treatment of malaria.2 Several diterpene lactones3,4 and
their glucosides,5,6 steroids, and triterpenes4 were isolated
from some species of Phlogacanthus. However, there is no
report about the chemical investigation on P. curviflorus.
In this study, five new compounds were isolated from
the EtOH extract of the roots of P. curviflorus. On the basis
of chemical and spectroscopic evidence, they were deter-
mined to be 14â,19-dihydroxyabieta-8,13(15)-dien-16,12-
olide (phlogacantholide B, 1), 14R,19-dihydroxyabieta-
8,13(15)-dien-16,12-olide (phlogacantholide C, 2), 14â,19-di-
hydroxyabieta-8,13(15)-dien-16,12-olide 19-O-â-D-glucopy-
ranoside (phlogacanthoside A, 3), 19-hydroxy-14-oxoabieta-
8,13(15)-dien-16,12-olide 19-O-â-D-glucopyranoside (phlo-
gacanthoside B, 4), and 14â,19-dihydroxyabieta-8,13(15)-
dien-16,12-olide 19-O-[2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl)]-
â-D-glucopyranoside (phlogacanthoside C, 5) (Figure 1). The
structure, including the relative configuration of phloga-
cantholide B (1), was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic
analysis of its diacetate (6). The known compounds are
betulin, â-sitosterol, â-daucosterol, lupeol,7 (+)-syringares-
inol, and (+)-syringaresinol-4-O-â-D-glucopyranoside.8
Compound 1 was isolated as colorless needles. Its mo-
lecular formula, C20H28O4, was established from the quasi
molecular ion peak at m/z 331.1917 [M - H]- in the
HRESIMS spectrum. The IR absorptions at 1738 and 1678
cm-1 and the 13C NMR signals at ä175.3, 162.9, and 120.7
(Table 1) revealed the presence of an R,â-unsaturated ç-lac-
tone. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 20 signals, of which
three were for methyls (ä 9.5, 19.4, 27.7) and one for a hy-
droxymethyl group (ä 64.1), indicating an abietane diterpene
with an R,â-unsaturated ç-lactone (Table 1). The major
structure of 1 was elucidated by HMBC and NOESY experi-
ments (Figure 1). To discriminate the lactonization between
C-16 and C-12, and between C-16 and C-14, this compound
was acetylated to give a diacetate (6). The HMBC correla-
tion observed between H-14 (ä 6.36) and the carbonyl of
the acetate (C-2′, ä 170.6) in 6, formed from the acetylation
at the 14-OH in 1, suggested the lactonization in 6 between
C-16 and C-12. The relative configuration of 1 was deter-
mined by NOESY experiments (Figure 1), in which H-14
and H-19 exhibited a NOE with H-20, and H-7R and H-12
exhibited NOEs with H-14, while H-5 exhibited a NOE
with H-7â. Thus, the structure of 1 was determined as
14â,19-dihydroxyabieta-8,13(15)-dien-16,12-olide (phloga-
cantholide B). X-ray crystallographic analysis of phloga-
cantholide B diacetate (6) (Figure 2) confirmed the pro-
posed structure and established the relative configuration.
Compound 2 was isolated as colorless needles. The same
molecular formula, C20H28O4, as 1 was observed from the
quasi molecular ion peak at m/z 331.1912 [M - H]- in the
HRESIMS spectrum. The IR spectrum and NMR data
(Table 1) were similar to those of 1 except for differences
in 1H NMR signals for H-7â, H-12, H-14, and H-17 and
the 13C NMR signals for C-9 and C-14. The NMR data of
its acetylated product (7) were also similar to those of 6
except for differences in 1H NMR signals of H-12, H-14,
and H-17 and in 13C NMR signals for C-9, C-14, and C-15.
The 1H NMR signal for H-14 shifted from ä 4.98 in 2 to ä
6.10 in 7, which indicated that the acetyl group could be
located at C-14 in 7. Therefore, the lactonization between
C-16 and C-12 was concluded. This conclusion was sup-
ported by the HMBC correlation between H-14 and the
carbonyl of the C-14 acetate (C-2′, ä 170.4) in 7. Thus, 2

appeared to be a stereoisomer of 1. This assumption was
further supported by evidence obtained from the NOESY
cross signal between H-14 and H-7â as well as the
disappearance of correlations between H-14 and H-12, or
H-20 (Figure 1). Consequently, the structure of 2 was
elucidated as 14R,19-dihydroxyabieta-8,13(15)-dien-16,12-
olide (phlogacantholide C).
Compound 3 was isolated as colorless needles. Its mo-
lecular formula was determined to be C26H38O9 on the basis
of the ion peak at m/z 493.2438 [M - H]- in the HRESIMS
spectrum. The IR spectrum suggested the presence of hy-
droxyl groups (3426 cm-1) and an R,â-unsaturated ç-lactone
(1738, 1683 cm-1). Acid hydrolysis of 3 afforded D-glucose,
which was detected by TLC and identified by its optical
rotation. The 1H NMR signal at ä 4.84 (d, 1H, J ) 7.7 Hz)
suggested a â-D-glucopyranoside. Besides the signals for
the â-D-glucopyranosyl group, the close similarity of the
13C NMR data to those of 1 suggested 3 was the glucoside
of phlogacantholide B. The 13C NMR signal for C-19 shifted
from ä 64.1 in 1 to ä 74.4 in 3, which indicated that the
â-D-glucopyranosyl moiety could be located at C-19. Thus,
3 was elucidated as 14â,19-dihydroxyabieta-8,13(15)-dien-
16,12-olide 19-O-â-D-glucopyranoside (phlogacanthoside A).
Compound 4 was isolated as colorless needles. Its mo-
lecular formula, C26H36O9, was established from the quasi
molecular ion peak at m/z 491.2272 [M - H]- in the
HRESIMS spectrum. The IR peaks at 1767, 1756, and 1675

cm-1 and the 13C NMR signals at ä 186.5, 174.9, 163.2, and
131.1 (Table 2) revealed the presence of a carbonyl carbon
and an R,â-unsaturated ç-lactone. Acid hydrolysis of 4
afforded D-glucose, which was identified by TLC and by its
optical rotation. The 1H NMR signal at H-1′ (ä4.84, d, J )
7.8 Hz) suggested a â-D-glucopyranosyl. The comparison
of 13C NMR data of 4 and 3 showed that the signal for C-14
was at ä 186.5 in 4 instead of at ä 71.1 as observed in 3,
indicating that C-14 in 4 was a carbonyl carbon. Thus, 4
was elucidated as 19-hydroxy-14-oxoabieta-8,13(15)-dien-
16,12-olide 19-O-â-D-glucopyranoside (phlogacanthoside B).
Compound 5 was isolated as a white powder. The quasi
molecular ion peak at m/z 673.2845 suggested the molec-
ular formula C35H46O13. The IR spectrum suggested the
presence of an R,â-unsaturated ç-lactone (1738 cm-1) and
a phenyl group (1612, 1516, 1464 cm-1). The 1H NMR
signal at ä 7.75 (2 H, s) and 13C NMR signals at äC 148.4,
142.5, 120.7, and 108.6 indicated that 5 possessed a
symmetrical tetrasubstituted phenyl group. From an HMBC
experiment, this moiety was determined to be the 4-hy-
droxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl group (Figure 1). Upon com-
parison of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR data of 5 with those
of 3 (Table 2) (except the signals for the 4-hydroxy-3,5-
dimethyoxybenzoyl), the close similarity of the 1H NMR
and 13C NMR data indicated that 5 was an acylated product
of 3. From the 1H-1H COSY experiment (Figure 1) the 1H
NMR signal at ä 5.92 could be assigned to H-2′. The benzoyl
moiety was located at C-2′ by the HMBC correlation
between H-2′ (ä 5.92) and C-7′′ (ä 166.0). From the HMBC
correlations between H-1′and C-19 and between H-19 and
C-1′, the glucosyl group was assigned to C-19. Compound
5 was therefore characterized as 14â,19-dihydroxyabieta-
8,13(15)-dien-16,12-olide 19-O-[2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethox-
ybenzoyl)]-â-D-glucopyranoside (phlogacanthoside C).
Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were
determined on an XRC-1 melting point apparatus and are
uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-
Elmer 341 automatic polarimeter. UV and IR spectra were
measured on a Lambda 35 spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer
FT-IR spectrometer (KBr disk), respectively. Mass spectra
were obtained on a Finnigan-LCQDECA mass spectrometer
(ESI-MS) and an API Q-STAR Pulsar i mass spectrometer
(HRESIMS). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
600 spectrometer with TMS as internal standard. Column
chromatography (CC) was carried out on silica gel (200-300
mesh; Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Group Co. of China), and
column fractions were monitored via thin-layer chromatogra-
phy (TLC) over silica gel 60H (Qingdao Haiyang Chemical
Group Co. of China) precoated plates. Resin adsorption chro-
matography was performed using macroporous resin D101
(The Chemical Plant of Nankai University, China).
Plant Material. Roots of P. curviflorus were collected in
August 1999 at Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province of China,
and identified by Prof. Jing-Yun Cui at Xisuanbanna Tropic
Botanic Garden, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A voucher
specimen (No. GF-38) was deposited in the Department for
Natural Products Research at Chengdu Institute of Biology,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Extraction and Isolation. Air-dried and powdered roots
of P. curviflorus (6.5 kg) were extracted with 95% EtOH (20 L
 4, each 7 days) at room temperature. After evaporating the

solvents in vacuo at 50 °C, a residue (350 g) was obtained.
This residue was dissolved in H2O (1 L) and then extracted
successively with petroleum ether (60-90 °C, 1 L  10), EtOAc
(1 L  5), and n-BuOH (1 L  4) to afford corresponding
fractions P (125 g), E (80 g), and B (114 g).
Fraction E was subjected to silica gel column chromatog-
raphy (CC) and eluted gradiently with CHCl3-MeOH (60:1
f 3:1) to give fractions E1-7. Fraction E2 (11.2 g) was
separated by silica gel CC with petroleum ether (60-90 °C)-
acetone (10:1) to give three subfractions, from which lupeol
(1.5 g), â-sitosterol (0.4 g), and betulin (1.8 g) were obtained
successively by recrystallization from acetone. 1 (0.9 g) was
obtained from E3 (3.3 g) by recrystallization from MeOH. The
remnant of E3 (2.3 g) was applied on silica gel CC, eluted with
CHCl3-acetone (5:1) to afford 2 (27 mg). â-Daucosterol (2.5 g)
was obtained from E5 (13.1 g) by recrystallization from MeOH.
E6 (18.7 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of MeOH, and then 20 mL
of acetone was added to the precipitated white powder (4.9 g),
which was then further subjected to silica gel CC, via elution
with CHCl3-MeOH (10:1), to afford 3 (280 mg) and 4 (3.2 g).
Fraction B was subjected to macroporous resin D101 CC
eluted with H2O, 70% EtOH, and 95% EtOH to give fractions
B1-3. Fraction B2 (61 g) was divided into subfractions 1-5
by silica gel CC, eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (20:1 f 1:1). 1
(2.5 g) was obtained from subfraction 1 (5.2 g) by recrystalli-
zation from MeOH, and the remnant (2.6 g) was then subjected
to silica gel CC eluted with CHCl3-EtOAc-MeOH (20:1:1) to
afford (+)-syringaresinol (20 mg). 5 (5 mg) was isolated from
subfraction 2 (11.3 g) by silica gel CC eluted with CHCl3-
acetone-MeOH (10:1:1). The separation of subfraction 4 (8.7
g) by silica gel CC eluted with CHCl3-2-propanol-MeOH (10:
1:1) afforded (+)-syringaresinol-4-O-â-D-glucopyranoside (70
mg) and 3 (270 mg).
Diacetylation of 1 and 2. Phlogacantholide B (1, 100 mg),
C5H5N (1 mL), and Ac2O (2 mL) were stirred at 20 °C for 12
h, and phlogacantholide B diacetate (6) (120 mg) was obtained
by evaporation in vacuo. Phlogacantholide C (2, 3 mg), C5H5N
(0.5 mL), and Ac2O (1 mL) were similarly acetylated to yield
3 mg of phlogacantholide C diacetate (7).
X-ray Crystallography of 6. Phlogacantholide B diacetate
(6, 60 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of acetone. The solution

Acid Hydrolysis of 3 and 4. Phlogacanthoside A (3, 20
mg) was heated with 2 mL of 2.5 mol/L HCl at 70 °C for 3 h.
After 5 mL of H2O was added and the mixture was extracted
with EtOAc, the aqueous phase was evaporated in vacuo to
yield 7 mg of D-glucose, which was detected by TLC and optical
rotation [R]D
20 +51.8° (c 0.14, H2O). Phlogacanthoside B (4, 20
mg) was treated as above to give 7 mg of D-glucose with an
optical rotation [R]D
20 +54.1° (c 0.12, H2O).
