As part of a continuing study of the induction of alkaloid biosyn- 
thesis, we report the isolation to homogeneity and characterization 
of S-adenosyl-i-methionine:tetrahydroberberine-cis-~-methyl- 
transferase from suspension cultures of Sanguinaria canadensis 
that were induced to produce alkaloids by hormone depletion. This 
enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific transfer of a methyl group 
from S-adenosyl-i-methionine to the tertiary nitrogen of the pro- 
toberberine alkaloid tetrahydroberberine (canadine). l h e  enzyme 
was purified 315-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel per- 
meation chromatography, affinity dye chromatography, and both 
diethylaminoethyl and Mono-Q ion-exchange chromatography. 
The enzyme was further purified to an optimum specific activity of 
225 nkat/mg of protein (3500-fold) and electrophoretic homoge- 
neity by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PACE). In con- 
trast to previous reports with partially purified enzyme, the isolated 
protein was found to have a pH optimum of 7.0, a temperature 
optimum of 25 to 30’C, and an isoelectric point of 5.1. Further- 
more, the molecular weight of the homogeneous protein was found 
to be 39,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PACE. The homogeneous 
enzyme preferred tetrahydroberberine over all other substrates 
tested, showing an apparent K,,, of 2.1 p ~ ,  but also showed partial 
activity with tetrahydrojatrorrhizine and tetrahydropalmatrubine. 
Sanguinaria canadensis L. (Papaveraceae) is a common 
woodland plant throughout the eastern and middle western 
United States and Canada. The benzophenanthridine alka- 
loids produced by S. canadensis (bloodroot) are of interest 
because of their various pharmaceutical properties, which 
include antibacterial (sanguinarine) and antineoplastic (san- 
guinarine, chelerythrine) activity (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis, 
1977). For example, the alkaloid sanguinarine has been com- 
mercialized for its activity against oral plaque-forming bac- 
teria (Dzink and Socransky, 1985), and recent studies have 
shown that chelerythrine is a potent protein kinase C inhib- 
itor (Herbert et al., 1990). These more recent uses for the 
quaternary alkaloids produced by S. canadensis and severa1 
other species of the Papaveraceae have stimulated continued 
interest in the plant cell tissue culture of these plant species 
and in the biosynthesis of their biologically active alkaloids. 
The biosynthesis of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids has

Agriculture.

been widely investigated and reviewed (Cordell, 1981; 
Beecher and Kelleher, 1988). The biosynthetic pathway lead- 
ing from Phe to the benzophenanthridine alkaloid sangui- 
narine involves approximately 17 different enzymic steps of 
which at least five are methyltransferases. Many putative 
methyltransferases from this pathway have been partially 
purified and characterized, includmg SAM:(R,S)-norlauda- 
nosoline 06-methyltransferase (Rueffer et al., 1983a), SAM:6- 
O-methyl-norlaudanosoline 05’-methyltransferase (Rueffer 
et al., 1983b), SAM:norreticuline N-methyltransferase (Wat 
et al., 1985), SAM:(R,S)-tetrahydrobenzylisoquinoline N- 
methyltransferase (Frenzel and Zenk, 1990a), SAM:3‘- 
hydroxy-N-methyl-(S)-coclaurine 04’-methyltransferase 
(Frenzel and Zenk, 1990b), SAM:(S)-scoulerine 09-methyl- 
transferase (Muemmler et al., 1985; Sato et al., 1993), and 
SAM:THB cis-N-methyltransferase (Rueffer and Zenk, 1986). 
A later revision of the biosynthetic scheme (Stadler et al., 
1987) determined that the trioxygenated alkaloid norcoclaur- 
ine, and not norlaudanosoline, was the precursor to the key 
intermediate reticuline. This resulted in a change in the 
proposed biosynthetic pathway that has, in turn, necessitated 
a re-evaluation of the characteristics of the first three of these 
early methyltransferases. 
The benzophenanthridine alkaloids are formed later in the 
biosynthetic pathway following the N-methylation of a va- 
riety of tetrahydroprotoberberine substrates (Cordell, 1981). 
Previous work (Takao et al., 1983) showed that only the cis- 
N-methyl derivatives of the tetrahydroprotoberberines can 
be further metabolized to form the protopine and benzo- 
phenanthridine skeletons. The stereospecific N-methylation 
of THB occurs via transfer of a methyl group from the 
substrate S-adenosyl-L-Met (Fig. 1) and has been shown to 
be catalyzed by a highly specific enzyme that has been 
partially purified from both S. canadensis (O’Keefe and 
Beecher, 1992) and Corydalis vaginans (Rueffer and Zenk, 
1986). More recent reports of partially purified protein from 
Eschscholtzia californica and C. vaginans have revised the 
characteristics of the enzyme by describing the partial puri- 
fication (90-fold) of a single enzyme responsible for the N- 
methylation of not only (S)-THB but other tetrahydroproto-

berberines (i.e. stylopine) as well (Rueffer et al., 1990). We 
now report the isolation, to homogeneity, of a similar enzyme 
that resides at a committed branch point in the biosynthesis 
of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids, SAM:THB-cis-N- 
methyltransferase, and has been purified from suspension 
cultures of S. canadensis. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Chemicals 
SAH was purchased from Sigma. [meth~l-~H]SAM was 
purchased from either Amersham, Sigma, or ICN. THB, 
tetrahydrojatrorrhizine, tetrahydropalmatrubine, tetrahydro- 
phenol base, tetrahydrocolumbamine, and tetrahydropal- 
matine were produced by sodium cyanoborohydide (Sigma) 
reduction of their quaternary equivalents immediately prior 
to use. Reticuline, norreticuline, coclaurine, and the remain- 
ing tetrahydroprotoberberine substrates were kindly supplied 
by Dr. Hélène Guinaudeau of the Centre D’Étude Des Plantes 
Medicinales. A11 other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, 
Aldrich, or Bio-Rad. 
Plant Material 
Cell-suspension cultures of Sanguinaria canadensis L. were 
grown in roller bottles containing 100 mL of Gamborg B5 
media (Gamborg et al., 1968) augmented with 0.5 mM 2,4-D 
at 23OC, and 5 g of inoculum were transferred to fresh 
medium every 14 d (Mahady and Beecher, 1990). Cells were 
induced to produce alkaloids by transfer into medium lacking 
a11 phytohormones and harvested 12 to 16 h later. Following 
suction filtration, cells were immediately frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at -83OC until used for the enzyme 
isolatioin. 
Methyltransferase Assay 
To assay for methyltransferase activity a standard assay 
solution consisting of 0.2 mM (R,S)-THB, 0.28 p~ [3H-methyl] 
SAM (9.5 mCi mmol-’), 3 mM DTT, 1% glycerol, and 50 mM 
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in a total volume of 100 
pL was freshly prepared. Reactions were initiated by the 
addition of 20 pL of the protein sample to the assay mix and 
were incubated for 30 min at 3OOC. The reaction was 
quenched by the addition of 100 pL of a saturated NaCl 
solution. Products of the reaction were extra(:ted by the 
addition of 1 mL of chloroform, followed by mechanical 
agitation and centrifugation (30008, 1 min). After the sample 
was centrifuged, 100 pL of the organic phase was placed in 
a scintillation via1 and diluted with 3.5 mL of scintillator 
(Scintilene, Fisher), and the radioactivity was measured on a 
Beckman LS5801 scintillation counter. Assays with boiled 
enzyme served as controls. 
For the native gel assays, the capillary gel was extruded 
from its tube and cut into 3-mm pieces. Each piece was then 
incubated with the standard assay mixture in a total volume 
of 100 pL at 23OC and allowed to react for 16 h (essentially 
exhausting the radiolabeled substrate). 
In the substrate specificity assays, the individual substrates 
replaceld THB in the standard assay mixture and were incu- 
bated with 30 pL of native gel-purified protein for 3 h at 
3OOC. For determination of metal ion requiremtmts the var- 
ious divalent cations were added to the reaction mixture in 
the standard buffer as their chloride salts. In addition, a 
second nonionic buffer system (20 mM Hepes, 3 mM DTT, 
1% glycerol, pH 7.0) was also used with a11 of lhe substrate 
concentrations and reaction conditions remaining the same. 
In the kinetics assays, reactions were measured at 5-, 10-, 
and 30-min intervals at the indicated concentrations of SAM 
and TH[B using protein purified through at least the Mono-Q 
step (Table I). A11 results are the average of at  least three 
experiments. 
Chromatography of Reaction Products 
To determine the stereospecificity of the rrtethyl group 
transfer, 100 pL of the Mono-Q-purified protein was incu- 
bated in the standard assay system to produce cmough reac-

tion product for characterization by TLC. Assay conditions 
were identical with the standard system except that the 
reaction was allowed to run to exhaustion and the total 
volume of the reaction was increased to 1 mL (with a11 
substrate concentrations unchanged). 
After the assay was complete the products were extracted 
from the buffer system as before except that the chloroform 
extraction step was repeated three times. The extracts were 
dried at room temperature under nitrogen, spotted on glass- 
backed silica gel plates (E. Merck), and co-chromatographed 
with a mixture of authentic cis- and truns-NMTHB with 
ch1oroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (140:40: 1) as a 
developing solvent. Following chromatography one side of 
the plate was sprayed with Dragendorff's reagent to locate 
the separated cis and trans alkaloids. The corresponding 
nonsprayed alkaloids were recovered, placed into a scintilla- 
tion vial, diluted with 3.5 mL of scintillation fluid, and 
counted for radioactivity. 
Enzyme Preparation and Purification 
A11 enzyme extraction and purification procedures were 
performed at O to 4OC unless otherwise stated. Frozen S. 
canadensis cells (1.9 kg) were ground under liquid nitrogen 
with a mortar and pestle and then placed in a 50 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3 mM DTT, 5 mM 
MgC12, and 1 % glycerol.The cellular slurry was homogenized 
on a Beckman Polytron for 30 s, and then the crude homog- 
enate was centrifuged at 12,OOOg for 15 min (model A-2; 
Lourdes Instrument Corp.). Following centrifugation, the su- 
pernatant was brought to 75% saturation with (NH4)2S04, 
E the protein was allowed to precipitate for 60 min, and the 
solution was centrifuged at 20,OOOg for 15 min. The super- 
natant was discarded, and the pellets were taken up in a 
minimum volume of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (3 mM 
DTT, 5 mM MgC12, 1% glycerol, pH 7.5). This mixture was 
desalted on a YM-30 membrane (Amicon). The resulting 
solution (70 mL) was immediately placed on a Cibacron blue 
3GA-agarose column (20 X 2.5 cm, Sigma) and washed 
through with an additional 400 mL of the starting buffer. 
The eluate (540 mL) was brought to 30% saturation with 
(NH4),S0, and, following precipitation, was centrifuged at 
20,OOOg for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and 
brought to 75% saturation with (NH4)2S04, the protein was 
allowed to precipitate for 60 min, and the mixture was again 
centrifuged at 20,OOOg for 15 min. The pellets were combined 
and taken up in a minimal volume of the 50 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer and placed on a Sephadex G-150 column 
(100 X 2.5 cm, Pharmacia). The column was eluted at a flow 
rate of 12 mL h-'. The active fractions were combined and 
concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged by ultrafiltration 
(YM-30 membrane, Amicon). This resulting active protein 
was then subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a 
DEAE-Sephacel column (20 X 2.5 cm, Pharmacia) that had 
been pre-equilibrated with a 10 mM sodium phosphate start- 
ing buffer (3 mM DTT, 1% glycerol, pH 7.5). 
After application of the protein the column was washed 
with 40 mL of the starting buffer and then eluted with a 
linear gradient from O to 0.5 M KCI over a volume of 160 mL. 
The enzyme activity eluted at approximately 0.25 M KCI. The 
active fractions were concentrated and desalted as before 
(YM-30 membrane, Amicon) and then applied at 23OC to a 
Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (HR 5/ 
5, Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with the 10 mM sodium phos- 
phate buffer. The column was washed with 20 mL of the 
starting buffer, followed by a 20-mL wash with starting 
buffer containing 0.1 M KCI. The active protein was then 
eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 M KCI over a 
volume of 40 mL. Finally, the column was washed with 1.0 
M KCI to remove any residual protein. 
Electrophoresis 
Active fractions eluted from the Mono-Q column were 
further purified on a native PAGE system consisting of a 
12.5% acrylamide (Sigma) tube gel (60 X 0.75 mm), adjusted 
to pH 7.5, and performed at a constant current of 0.35 mA 
gel-' at 4OC using standard buffer systems according to the 
method of Laemmli (1970) augmented with 5 mM DTT. 
SDS-PAGE was camed out using 12.5% polyacrylamide 
(Sigma) slab gels adjusted to pH 8.8 with stacking gels 
adjusted to pH 6.8 and buffer systems according to the 
method of Laemmli (1970). HPEC was performed on native 
gels with both 7 and 10% polyacrylamide (2.5 X 50 mm) on 
a model 230 HPEC system (Applied Biosystems) according 
to the manufacturer's protocols. 
Protein Determinations 
Protein concentrations were established by colorimetric 
assay using a Coomassie brilliant blue-based system (Bio- 
Rad) with BSA as a standard according to procedures of 
Bradford (1976). In the case of HPEC-purified protein, con- 
centrations were determined by amirio acid analysis on a 
automated amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems, model 
420A) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 
M, Determination 
The mo1 wt of the protein was determined by comparison 
to standards (SDS-6H, Sigma) run on the standard SDS- 
PAGE system. The mo1 wt markers used were carbonic 
anhydrase (M, 29,000), ovalbumin (M, 45,000), BSA (M, 
66,000), phosphorylase B (M, 97,400), and 8-galactosidase 
(Mr 116,000). The native molecular radius of the protein was 
determined by comparison to a calibration of standard pro- 
teins on a fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration 
Superose 12 column (HR 10/30, Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 
500 gL min-'. The molecular radius markers used were the 
same as those used in the SDS-PAGE system except that in 
this instance the standard proteins were analyzed in their 
native state. Active enzyme fractions purified through the G- 
150 (17-fold), Mono-Q (315-fold), and HPEC (3500-fold) 
steps were analyzed by this procedure. 
IEF 
IEF was done using a non-urea polyacrylamide tube gel on 
the Bio-Rad MiniProtean I1 system at 4OC. The isoelectric 
point of the protein was determined by comparison to a 
standard calibration done using standards (IEF Mix 11, Sigma)

manufacturer's protocols.
RESULTS
Purification
The protocol adopted to purify THB-N-methyltransferase
and results of the various procedures used are summarized
in Table I. The enzyme was enriched 315-fold using ammo-
nium sulfate fractionation, Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose,
Sephadex G-150, and DEAE-Sephacel and Mono-Q anion
exchange. Of particular note in the early purification proce-
dures is the Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose affinity dye gel. This
column bound approximately 50% of the total protein but
did not bind the N-methyltransferase, thereby resulting in
the removal of the majority of the unwanted protein with a
simple bulk wash. Also of interest is that the results of the
DEAE-Sephacel column indicated the possible presence of
more than one enzyme active in our assay system (data not
shown). Because of this apparent heterogeneity, the active
fractions from this column were rechromatographed on a
Mono-Q column, which resulted in the separation of two
active protein peaks; the most active of these peaks was
carried on to the final purification procedures. Later analysis
of the second peak revealed that the active protein present
had a mol wt similar to that of the protein from the the first
peak but that it possessed only 25% of the relative activity.
The final step in the purification was native gel electropho-
resis, and two different systems were used. First the Mono-
Q-purified protein was separated on minitube gels in a Bio-
Rad MiniProtean II gel electrophoresis system according to
the procedures reported earlier. The tube gels were then cut
into 3-mm sections and tested for activity. The results of a
typical experiment are shown in Figure 2A. SDS-PAGE
analysis of the active sections revealed a single band of
protein, corresponding to a mol wt of approximately 39,000
(Fig. 2B). The homogeneity of the native protein was later
confirmed by capillary gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C). The
native gel system was then adapted to preparative HPEC,
which allowed the active protein to be eluted from the gel
matrix and analyzed for specific activity (Fig. 3). The HPEC-
purified protein was found to be fully active and was purified
3500-fold, exhibiting a specific activity of 225 nkat mg~'.
The HPEC-purified protein was found to be stable for 30
d at 4°C in the presence of DTT (3 ITIM) and 1% glycerol.
Furthermore, this protein was still active after 1 year when
stored at —83°C in the same buffer system, although, when
thawed, it remained active for only 3 d at 4°C.
Temperature and pH Optima
The temperature dependence of the enzyme was examined
over the range from 0 to 50°C/ and a broad maximum was
found between 25 and 30°C with a distinct decrease in
activity outside the range of 20 to 35°C (Fig. 4). The pH
dependence of the enzyme activity was also examined over
the range pH 4.5 to 9.0 in the standard 50 mM phosphate
buffer system. In this case, a sharp peak of activity was found
at pH 7.0, with 50% of the activity lost at pH 6.5 and 8.0.

lsolation of Tetrahydroberberine-N-Methyltransferase 399 
Both the temperature and pH maxima for the N-methyl- 
transferase are similar to likely physiological conditions, al- 
though both are lower than previously reported for the 
partially purified enzyme (Rueffer et al., 1990). In both cases, 
these discrepancies may be accounted for by the large back- 
ground levels that were seen in the control experiments at 
basic pHs and at temperatures greater than 3OOC. 
MOI W t  
The mo1 wt of the homogeneous protein was determined 
by comparison with the mobility of commercially available 
standards on SDS-PAGE. The protein was run in both the 
presence and absence of reducing agents (DTT or P-mercap- 
toethanol) to ensure that disulfide bridge formation was not 
altering the results. In both cases the homogeneous protein 
showed a single band at approximately 39,000. This mo1 wt 
is much lower than that reported for this enzyme in other 
plant species (78,000 and 72,000 for E. californica and C. 
vaginans, respectively) (Rueffer et al., 1990). 
Because of the differences between the previously reported 
mo1 wts and our results, we sought to determine the native 
molecular radius of the N-methyltransferase by gel permea- 
tion chromatography on a high-performance Superose 12 HR 
column. Earlier attempts to resolve the active protein by gel 
permeation on analytical Sephadex G-150 and G-200 col- 
umns revealed that the activity was eluting at a retention 
volume corresponding to a mo1 wt of approximately 70,000. 
The molecular radius was determined by comparison with 
the same mo1 wt standards used for the SDS-PAGE analysis, 
except that a11 of the proteins were chromatographed in their 
native state. The results indicated that, whereas a11 of the 
standard proteins eluted at rates relative to their mobility in 
the SDS-PAGE system, the N-methyltransferase did not. It 
was determined that in this system, as in the earlier experi- 
ments, the N-methyltransferase eluted at a retention volume 
corresponding to a molecular radius of 70,000 (*3%). Fur- 
thermore, the retention volume of the active protein did not 
change with increasing levels of purification, because enzyme 
fractions purified 17-, 315-, or 3500-fold a11 displayed similar 
retention volumes. The results indicate either that the native 
protein is a homodimer or that the protein is not globular.

pH 7.0). 
lsoelectric Point 
The isoelectric point of the enzyme was determined by IEF 
on a polyacrylamide-based system, followed by SDS-PAGE. 
The native gel-purified protein was compared with commer- 
cially available standards and was found to have an isoelectric 
point of 5.1. The protein did not focus particularly well and 
usually gave a slightly smeared spot with the great majority 
of the protein residing at the isoelectric point. 
Metal lon lnteractions 
The divalent metal ion interactions of the N-methyltrans- 
ferase were examined, and the results were found to be 
greatly dependent on the buffer system used for the analysis. 
Initial studies were conducted in a 50 mM sodium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.0), and the results indicated a slight increase in 
enzyme activity with increasing Mg2+ concentrations, 
whereas the heavy metal ions Co2+ and Zn2+ were found to 
be inhibitory. The increased activity of the enzyme in re- 
sponse to Mg2+ was similar to previously published reports 
of other plant-derived methyltransferases (Jay et al., 1983; 
Knogge and Weissenbock, 1984). However, when the same

interactions were examined in a non-ionic buffer system (20 
mM Hepes, pH 7.0), the results were completely different. As 
detailed in Table 11, when placed in the Hepes buffer system 
the enzyme was not only inhibited by the heavy metal cations 
Co2+ and Zn2+ but also by Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg". Finally, it 
was shown that the addition of 10 mM EDTA increased N- 
methyltransferase activity in crude enzyme preparations 
using either the Hepes or the phosphate buffer systems. 
Substrate Specificity 
The substrate specificity of the enzyme was examined to 
determine the range of isoquinoline substrates that could be 
methylated. Of the 14 tetrahydroprotoberberine substrates 
tested (Fig. 6), none showed the leve1 of activity displayed 
by THB (100%). Furthermore, only tetrahydropalmatrubine 
(45%) and tetrahydrojatrorrhizine (7%) showed partia1 activ- 
ity with the enzyme, whereas tetrahydropalmatine, tetra- 
hydrocolumbamine, tetrahydrophenolbase, kikemanine, 
scoulerine, stylopine, cheilanthifoline, thalictracavine, ani- 
bacanine, xylopinine, and pseudo-anibacanine were shown 
to be inactive. In addition, five benzylisoquinoline alkaloids 
(reticuline, coclaurine, norreticuline, norlaudanosoline, and 
N-methylcoclaurine) were also tested, and none of these 
compounds was found to be an acceptable substrate for the 
N-methyltransferase. 
The purified enzyme shows a very high degree of specific- 
ity with very strict limitations on the acceptable substitution 
patterns on rings A and D of the protoberberine skeleton. At 
first it was surprising that no activity for stylopine was found 
with the homogeneous protein, because such activity had 
been reported earlier (Rueffer et al., 1990). Upon re-analysis 
we did see the stylopine-N-methyltransferase activity in ear-

Stereospecificity of the Methylation Reaction 
To determine the position of the N-methyl group on the 
product NMTHB, a large-scale assay was run and the prod- 
ucts of the reaction were separated by TLC. The cis and truns 
isomers of standard NMTHB were separated using a chloro- 
formmethano1:ammonium hydroxide (140:40:1) solvent sys- 
tem and silica gel plates (RF = 0.24 and 0.41, respectively). 
When the radiolabeled enzyme reaction protluct was co- 
chromatographed with standard compounds, followed by 
scintillation counting of the excised spots, we found that a11 
of the alkaloid-associated radioactivity residetl in the spot 
corresponding to the cis conformation of the product NMTHB 
(Fig. 7).  
Kinetics 
Kinetic analysis was done to examine the affinity of the 
enzyme for the two main substrates THB and SAM. The K,,, 
for (R,S)-THB was found to be 2.1 PM (Fig. BA), and the K ,  
for SAM was found to be 1.2 PM (Fig. 8B). Both figures 
compare favorably to those previously published for meth- 
yltransferases along this secondary biosynthetic pathway 
(Frenzel and Zenk, 1990a; Rueffer et al., 1990). The known 
methyltransferase inhibitor SAH was also examined for com- 
petitive inhibition of the enzyme and, as expected, displayed 
classic competitive inhibition giving a K, of 7.5 PM (data not 
shown).

the alkaloid berberine and the sulfhydryl-modifying agent

relates well with the reducing agent requirement for this 
enzyme and suggests that reduced Cys residues may be 
involved with the active site of this enzyme. 
DlSCUSSlON 
The enzyme SAM:THB-cis-N-methyltransferase has been 
purified to homogeneity from suspension cultures of S. can- 
adensis. This enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific transfer of 
a methyl group from the substrate SAM to the tertiary 
nitrogen of the protoberberine alkaloid THB. The enzyme 
was purified 3500-fold to an extremely high specific activity 
of 225 nkat mg-’, despite the fact that this protein was present 
in only minute concentrations (0.001% of total protein). The 
specific activity of the purified THB-N-methyltransferase 
from S. canadensis is in the same range as that reported for 
dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase from this plant (Arak- 
awa et al., 1992) but approximately 200 times greater than 
that reported for the tetrahydroprotoberberine-N-methyl- 
transferase from E. californica (Rueffer et al., 1990). The final 
native gel electrophoresis step in the purification was the key 
to obtaining active homogeneous enzyme. Throughout the 
purification procedures two bands of protein were contin- 
ually co-eluting in the active fractions, one at approximately 
39,000 and one at approximately 80,000. Although many 
other methods of purification were attempted, including SAH 
affinity, hydroxylapatite, gel permeation, and hydrophobic 
interaction chromatography, only the native gel technique 
provided electrophoretically pure protein. 
The isolated protein was shown to have a mo1 wt of 
approximately 39,000 by SDS-PAGE. This value is smaller 
than previously reported for this enzyme (Rueffer and Zenk, 
1986) but similar to that reported for other plant-derived 
methyltransferases (Preisig et al., 1989; Bugos et al., 1991; 
Sato et al., 1993). The native molecular radius, as determined 
by gel filtration, was found to be greater than that of BSA 
(Mr 66,000), indicating that the protein either is not globular 
or is a homodimer in its native state. This discrepancy be- 
tween the mol wt and molecular radius has been reported 
previously for plant-derived methyltransferases (Preisig et 
al., 1989; Bugos et al., 1991; Sato et al., 1993). The fact that 
both the reduced and oxidized forms of the homogeneous 
native enzyme are indistinguishable by capillary gel electro- 
phoresis, together with evidence that both the native and 
urea-denatured forms of the enzyme show identical two- 
dimensional electrophoretic positions, indicates that, al- 
though the possibility of a dimer cannot be completely ruled 
out at this time, the probability is that the protein is not 
globular. Mass spectral analysis of both the native and de- 
natured forms of the protein, presently being undertaken 
in our laboratory, should differentiate between these two 
possibilities. 
The purified N-methyltransferase was found to be stable 
at 4OC for severa1 weeks when kept in buffer augmented 
with 3 mM DTT and 1% glycerol and was still active after 1 
year when stored at -83OC. The temperature and pH optima 
of 25 to 3OoC and 7.0, respectively, are very close to phys- 
iological conditions, although significantly lower than those 
reported for a less highly purified enzyme from E. californica 
and C. uaginans (Rueffer et al., 1990). 
Previous reports of divalent metal ion interactions with 
methyltransferases appear almost equally split between those 
that display enhanced activity in the presence of Mg2+ and 
those that show no metal ion requirements (for a review, see 
Poulton, 1981). In the case of THB-N-methyltransferase the 
interaction with metal ions was shown to be greatly influ-

enced by the buffer system used. When an ionic buffer such 
as sodium phosphate was used, the buffer interacted with 
the divalent metal ions, leading to the spurious result that 
Mgz+ cations enhanced enzyme activity. Upon examination 
of the same interactions in a noninteracting Hepes buffer, it 
was clearly demonstrated that, not only did the metal ions 
not increase enzyme activity, they strongly inhibited it. 
THB-N-methyltransferase was found to be stringently spe- 
cific with regard to acceptable tetrahydroprotoberberine sub- 
strates. Of the 15 tetrahydroprotoberberine and 5 benzyliso- 
quinoline compounds tested, only THB was fully active, 
whereas tetrahydrojatrorrhizine and the unnatural substrate 
tetrahydropalmatrubine showed partia1 activity with the ho- 
mogeneous enzyme. Neither of the early protoberberine in- 
termediates scoulerine or tetrahydrocolumbamine were active 
with the enzyme. Because most of the tetrahydroprotober- 
berine substrates tested differed only in the substitution 
pattem on the A and D ring systems, it is apparent that these 
regions are key to the specificity of the enzyme. 
The lack of methyltransferase activity with the substrate 
stylopine was not expected, because earlier descriptions of 
this enzyme had indicated equivalent activity for stylopine 
and THB (Rueffer et al., 1990). This ability to differentiate 
between stylopine and THB, however, has been reported 
with other enzymes along this biosynthetic pathway (Gal- 
neder et al., 1988; De-Eknamkul et al., 1992). Because crude 
enzyme preparations from S. canadensis do show the ability 
to N-methylate stylopine, whereas the homogeneous protein 
does not, the probability is that another enzyme is responsible 
for the activity demonstrated for this substrate. 
The kinetic analysis of THB-N-methyltransferase was ini- 
tially hampered by the fact that both of the major contami- 
nants in the substrates SAM and THB were inhibitory to the 
methylation reaction (SAH and berberine, respectively). 
When these impurities were removed, the purified enzyme 
displayed a high degree of affinity for both substrates, indi- 
cated by the low K ,  values of 2.1 p~ for (R,S)-THB and 1.2 
p~ for SAM. The competitive inhibition of the enzyme by 
the reaction product SAH was expected, and the K, of 7.5 p~ 
is slightly lower than that reported for the enzyme from E. 
californica and C. vaginans (Rueffer et al., 1990). This product 
inhibition by SAH is in contrast to the other product of the 
reaction, NMTHB, which was not found to be inhibitory even 
at levels of 100 p~ (data not shown). 
The requirement for reducing agents such as DTT and P- 
mercaptoethanol indicated that one or more reduced Cys 
residues was involved in enzyme activity. This hypothesis 
was confirmed by the ability of the sulfhydryl-alkylating 
compound N-ethylmaleimide to completely inhibit the en- 
zyme. Similar requirements for reduced sulfhydryl groups by 
plant-derived methyltransferases have been reported fre- 
quently in the literature (for a review, see Poulton, 1981). 
The results presented here show that THB-N-methyltrans- 
ferase is a very specific branch point enzyme in the biosyn- 
thesis of the benzophenanthridine alkaloids by S. canadensis. 
The enzyme was purified to the highest leve1 of specific 
activity by native gel electrophoresis, and this active protein 
was shown to be homogeneous by both SDS-PAGE and 
capillary gel electrophoresis. Because of the differences be- 
tween the characteristics of the homogeneous enzyme from 
S. canadensis reported here and those described previously 
(e.g. mo1 wt, pH, and temperature optima, substriate specific- 
ity; Rueiffer and Zenk, 1986; Rueffer et al., 1990), it is appar- 
ent that the analysis of partially purified enzymes can lead 
to results representative of a mixture of proteins that do not 
necessaiily represent the enzyme of interest. Coníinued work 
toward a more detailed analysis of the physical and kinetic 
characteristics of THB-N-methyltransferase, as well as a more 
thorough understanding of the regulation of this biosynthetic 
pathwa:y, is presently being undertaken in our laboratory.
