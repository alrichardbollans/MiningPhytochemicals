The plants of Rhynchosia genus (Leguminosae) are herba-ceous, commonly climbing or trailing, sometimes woody,with a woody rootstock.2) There are two hundred speciesthroughout the tropics and subtropics with the greatest num-ber in Africa. Some species have attractive seeds, which havebeen used as beads. The seeds of R. volubilis LOUR. havebeen used as an expectorant in Japanese folk medicine(Tankiri-Mame).In the course of our continuing studies on the antiprolifer-ative principles of higher plant origin, we found that theMeOH extract of these seeds inhibits the growth of humangastric adenocarcinoma [MK-1, 50% growth inhibition (GI50):25 mg/ml], human uterus carcinoma (HeLa, GI50: 30 mg/ml),and murine melanoma (B16F10, GI50: 8 mg/ml) cells. Theseresults led to our interest in the investigation of the chemicalconstituents of the MeOH extract. This paper deals with theisolation and identification of the active constituents.MATERIALS AND METHODSInstruments and Reagents The instruments and reagentsused in this study are the same as those described in the pre-vious paper.3)Materials The seeds of R. volubilis were collected fromOgawa Island, Saga Prefecture, Japan, in October, 1999. Thetest samples of ellagic acid , dehydrodigallic acid, flavogal-lonic acid dilactone, and tergallic acid dilactone were thosepreviously isolated by two authors (Tanaka and Nonaka)from Nuphar japonicum4) and Mallotus japonicus.5) Extraction and Isolation The seeds (323 g) were pow-dered and extracted with MeOH under reflux. The extractwas partitioned between EtOAc and 40% MeOH. After evap-oration, the 40% MeOH extract was subjected to Diaion HP-20 column chromatography using H2O and MeOH. Bothfractions were further purified by Sephadex LH-20 (50%MeOH, MeOH) chromatography, and the antiproliferativeactivity was monitored. The MeOH fraction (1.0 g) providedgallic acid methylester (1) (130 mg) and 1,6-di-O-galloylglu-cose (4) (30 mg), and from the H2O fraction (7.0 g), gallicacid (2) (140 mg) and 1-O-galloylglucose (5) (70 mg) wereisolated. The EtOAc layer was concentrated and the extract(14 g) was subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatog-raphy (CHCl3 : MeOH : H2O55 : 5 : 1) to afford four fractions(Fr. I—IV). Since the latter three fractions showed antiprolif-erative activity, they were further purified by the same resinchromatography using different solvent systems. Compound5 (240 mg) from Fr. II (1.4 g, solvent; 50%MeOH), com-pounds 1 (2.4 g), 2 (570 mg) and 5 (130 mg) from Fr. III (4.4g, solvent; MeOH), and trigalloylgallic acid (6) (50 mg) and7-O-galloylcatechin (3) (280 mg) from Fr. IV (0.4 g, solvent;EtOH) were isolated. Compounds 1—6 were identified asgallic acid methylester, gallic acid,6) 7-O-galloylcatechin,7)1,6-di-O-galloylglucose,6) 1-O-galloylglucose,8) and trigal-loylgallic acid,9) respectively, by comparison of their physicaldata with those reported.Cells MK-1 was provided from Dr. M. Katano, Facultyof Medicine, Kyushu University. HeLa and B16F10 weresupplied from the Cell Resource Center for the BiomedicalResearch Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, To-hoku University.Determination of Antiproliferative Activity The inhi-bition of the cellular growth was estimated using the MTTassay described by Mosmann.10) The detailed procedure isshown in the previous paper.11)RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBioactivity-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract ofthe seeds of Rhynchosia volubilis has resulted in the isolationof six polyphenols, 1—6 (Fig. 1).The antiproliferative activity of each isolate was deter-mined by the MTT assay, and their GI50 values are listed inTable 1.All isolates inhibited the growth of three tumor cells, andwere more potent against B16F10 than against HeLa andMK-1. Compound 6 showed the highest activity of all, and 2followed next. The activity of 1 and three other esters (3—5)were less potent than that of 2.

Received August 1, 2001; accepted August 22, 2001The MeOH extract of the seeds of Rhynchosia volubilis (Leguminosae) showed antiproliferative activityagainst human gastric adenocarcinoma [MK-1, 50% growth inhibition (GI50): 25 mg/ml], human uterus carci-noma (HeLa, GI50: 30 mg/ml), and murine melanoma (B16F10, GI50: 8 mg/ml) cells. Bioactivity-guided fractiona-tion resulted in the isolation of gallic acid methylester (1), gallic acid (2), 7-O-galloylcatechin (3), 1,6-di-O-galloyl-glucose (4), 1-O-galloylglucose (5), and trigalloylgallic acid (6), and their antiproliferative activity was estimated.All showed much stronger inhibition against B16F10 cell growth than against HeLa and MK-1 cell growth. Com-pound 2 and its tetramer (6) with a free carboxyl group showed higher activity than those which did not have afree carboxyl group. In relation to the gallic acid tetramer (6), two gallic acid dimers (ellagic acid and dehydrodi-gallic acid) and trimers (tergallic acid dilactone and flavogallonic acid dilactone) were tested for their activity,and compared with those of the isolates. Key words Rhynchosia volubilis; antiproliferative activity; polyphenol; gallic acid and related compoundgroup of gallic acid reduced the activity. A similar result hasalready been reported against rat hepatoma (dRLh-84) cellsby Inoue et al.12) We have also observed the phenomenonthat the antiproliferative activity of caffeic acid is lowered byesterification.1)In spite of structural differences, 5 and 3 showed similaractivity. Since the activity of catechin was less potent thanthat of 3 (not shown), the presence of the galloyl groupwould be a key factor for antiproliferative activity.The GI50 values of 4 are slightly smaller than those of 5.Furthermore, the GI50 value of 6, which was a tetramer of 2,was about one-half that of 2. These data suggest that thenumber of the galloyl group would be one factor for enhanc-ing the activity, although not directly proportional.Inoue et al. elucidated that three adjacent phenolic hy-droxyl groups of gallic acid should be essential to the cyto-toxicity, since the methylation (syringic acid, 4-O-methyl gal-late) or deletion (protocatechuic acid, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoicacid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid) of phenolic hydroxyl groupscompletely removed the cytotoxicity. And a carboxyl groupis likely to be necessary in order for gallic acid to show se-lectivity to cancer cells, since pyrogallol killed not onlydRLh-84 cells, but also primary cultured rat hepatocytes.12)Furthermore, they also disclosed that the cell death inducedby gallic acid was accompanied by internucleosomal DNAfragmentation characteristic of apoptosis.13)In order to clarify in more detail the structure-antiprolifer-ative activity relationship of gallic acid derivatives, we testedfor the antiproliferative activity of ellagic acid and three re-lated phenol carboxylic acids (Fig. 2) which are the non-sac-charide parts of hydrolyzable tannins. We checked the activ-ity of two dimers of gallic acid, ellagic acid (EA) and dehy-drodigallic acid (DA), and two trimers, flavogallonic acid di-lactone (FAD) and tergallic acid dilactone (TAD). All inhib-ited B16F10 cell growth, were less active against MK-1 cells,and almost inactive toward HeLa cells.Against our first conjecture that the number of the galloylgroup and the presence/absence of the free carboxyl groupinfluenced the activity, EA, a gallic acid dimer with neither afree carboxyl group nor three adjacent phenolic hydroxylgroups, showed almost similar activity to that of 2 againstB16F10 cells, and the activity of the other three derivativeswith the free carboxyl group were less than EA, exceptagainst HeLa cells.1444 Vol. 24, No. 12Fig. 1.
