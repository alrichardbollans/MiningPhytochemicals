Plants of thisgenus have been used for a great variety of medicinal purposesas well as an incense with insecticidal properties1. Vitexcymosa Bertero is a small tree widely distributed in the Centraland Amazon regions of Brazil where it is popularly known as“Tarumã-do-Igapó” and “Tarumã-do-alagado”2.In 1995, Watanabe3 et al. isolated the monoterpenedialdehyde rotundial (3) as a new natural mosquito repellentfrom V. rotundifolia. In other studies, derivatives of aucubinand mussaenosidic acid were found in various Vitex species4,5,6.We now report the isolation and identification, from theleaves of V. cymosa, of a new iridoid, closely related to 3which was named tarumal (1), as well as the knowncompounds viteoid II (2) and agnuside (4).Results and DiscussionFrom the dichloromethane extract from the leaves of V.cymosa a new iridoid aglycone was isolated as a colourlessoil which was named tarumal, (1).*e-mail: sgleitao@pharma.ufrj.br O C H O O 5 6 3 1 1 6 5 O O H H O H O C H O C H O 5 6 1 3 3 1              2             3  O O G l u H O H O O O 1 3 4 5 6 9 10 4 5 6 1 4 3 H H O H O COOH OH5      The 1H NMR data of 1 showed some similarities withthose of 3 (Table 1). In particular, the signals arising fromthe aldehyde conjugated with the endocyclic double bondat δ 9.98 and the methyl group located on the same doublebond at δ 2.17. However, instead of the other aldehyde signalof 3, a signal was observed at δ 5.00, indicating the presenceof an acetal. Further, a doublet of doublets at δ 4.65suggested the additional presence of an oxygen functionand a three proton singlet at δ 3.33 showed the presence ofa methoxyl group.764 Santos et al. J. Braz.

In comparison with the spectrum of 3 the replacementof the aldehyde by an acetal was confirmed by the absenceof the signal at δ 201.9 and the presence of an additionalsignal at δ 105.8. Further, one methylene group wasreplaced by an oxygen bearing carbon (δ 78.4).Table 2. 13C NMR spectral data (CDCl3,TMS) of 1 , 2 , 3, 5 andCrescentin II.C 1 2 3a 5b 5c Crescentin IId1 188.0 165.9 187.9 167.9 169.0 175.03 105.8 70.8 201.9 61.5 61.4 59.54 38.0 29.0 47.7 35.3 34.3 33.55 47.3 51.0 38.0 54.4 53.7 52.26 78.4 79.2 28.1 75.0 75.0 74.17 46.0 42.2 39.0 43.9 43.9 45.38 159.6 161.6 164.2 158.1 157.6 145.89 139.6 123.6 139.0 130.9 130.6 133.510 14.3 60.3 14.7 60.6 60.4 60.9OMe 54.4 - - - -a Data from ref. 3; b MeOD4 ; c D2O ; d D2O, data from ref. 7.On the basis of these data the structure of  1 was obtained.The configuration at C-5 was considered to be R, (with a5β-oriented H) on biosynthetic grounds (its relation with 3,in which the same stereochemistry has been determined, seebelow). Furthermore, nearly all iridoids which have beenfound in nature have this configuration. Only a fewexceptions are kown, none of which are within the familyVerbenaceae. The ring closure with the substituent at C-6requires the S configuration for the latter. By analysis of thecoupling constants, the configuration of C-3 was determinedto be R (Figure 1). This was confirmed by molecularmodelling using the program Serena Software for PC, v. 4.0. This program uses a molecular mechanics approach tocalculate the best conformation. In contrast to the programsusing molecular orbital interactions the molecular mechanicsapproach can be used satisfactorily for the determination ofconfigurations of 5-membered ring systems. For each of theC-3 configurations, two least energy conformations werefound. One with the C-3 methoxyl-substituent in an axialposition and another with the substituent in a equatorialposition. Only 3R-tarumal with the methoxyl group in anaxial position (Figure1) showed complete agreement of thecalculated coupling constants with the experimental values.In this comparison all coupling constants of the completemolecule were considered. Especially the coupling constantsof H-4α and H-4β with both H-3 and H-5 showed largedifferences between the experimental and calculatedcoupling constants (see Table 3). According to the heats offormation calculated by PC-model for the conformers of3R-tarumal, the conformer with the methoxyl group in anaxial position should also be the most stable and thus be thepredominant conformer.Vol. 12 No. 6, 2001 Iridoids from Vitex cymosa 765From the butanol extract of the leaves of the sameplant, 1 was reisolated together with another iridoidaglycone which was identified as viteoid II (2). Thisextract also yielded the known iridoid agnuside (4), whichhas been isolated before from V. rotundifolia5. 1H and13C NMR data reported in the literature for viteoid H5are almost identical to those obtained for compound 2(Tables 1 and 2). The relative stereo-chemistry proposedby the authors5 is also in good agreement with our nOedifference experiments (Figure 2). Irradiation of H-6yielded strong enhancements of the signals of H-7α (6. 5%) and H-4β (3. 2 %), while no enhancement of the H-5signal was observed. Irradiation of H-5 yieldedenhancements of H-4β (3. 0 %), H-3β (4.0 %) and H-7β(6.1 %). Based on the same arguments as mentioned abovefor 1, the configuration at C-5 should be R. Molecularmodeling of 2 showed that the configuration at C-6 shouldbe R. This was based on the comparison of the predictedvalues (data not shown) of all coupling constants of theentire molecule of both stereoisomers with theexperimental values. The presence of a bicyclic structurewas confirmed in the HMBC spectrum of 2 by a longrange correlation of C-1 (δ 165. 9) with H-3α and H-3βat δ 4.41 and δ 4.31, respectively.Upon standing in methanol, we observed that 2decomposed to another product. This was also describedfor viteoid II5 and the decomposition product was identifiedas 1-oxo-eucommiol (5). At the time of the submission ofthis paper, the same structure 5 was reported for anotherproduct, crescentin II, isolated from Crescentia cujete7.Our present study confirms the structure published for 1-oxo-eucommiol (5) and consequently the structure ofcrescentin II needs revision. However, we cannot suggestan alternative structure for crescentin II based on thepublished spectral data.All the proton and carbon assignments of 1, 2 and 5(Tables1 and 2) were confirmed by 2D NMR measurements(HSQC and HMBC).In order to verify the possibility of 1 being an artifact,reisolation of this substance was performed withoutpurification on Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH. Afterfractionation of the dichloromethane extract by CC usinga CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient, the fractions eluted withCH2Cl2-EtOAC (9:1) which presumably contained 1 wereanalyzed by HPLC. The presence of 1 could be confirmedby comparison of retention times, UV spectra and co-injection with pure 1.Compounds 1 and 2  are closely related to 3 .Compound 1 might well be biosynthetically derived from3 by a hydroxylation on C-6, subsequent hemiacetalformation with the C-3 aldehyde, and a reaction with amolecule of MeOH.The occurrence of ciclopentene iridoids has been reportedfrom various families. Recently the presence of rotundial wasreported in Alberta magna8 (Rubiaceae).
