Abstract
Phyllanthus watsonii Airy Shaw is an endemic plant found in Peninsular Malaysia. Although there are numerous reports on
the anti cancer properties of other Phyllanthus species, published information on the cytotoxicity of P. watsonii are very
limited. The present study was carried out with bioassay-guided fractionation approach to evaluate the cytotoxicity and
apoptosis induction capability of the P. watsonii extracts and fractions on human gynecologic (SKOV-3 and Ca Ski) and colon
(HT-29) cancer cells. P. watsonii extracts exhibited strong cytotoxicity on all the cancer cells studied with IC50 values of
# 20.0 mg/mL. Hexane extract of P. watsonii was further subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and yielded 10 fractions
(PW-1RPW-10). PW-4RPW-8 portrayed stronger cytotoxic activity and was further subjected to bioassay-guided
fractionation and resulted with 8 sub-fractions (PPWH-1RPPWH-8). PPWH-7 possessed greatest cytotoxicity (IC50 values
ranged from 0.66 – 0.83 mg/mL) and was selective on the cancer cells studied. LC-MS/MS analysis of PPWH-7 revealed the
presence of ellagic acid, geranic acid, glochidone, betulin, phyllanthin and sterol glucoside. Marked morphological changes,
ladder-like appearance of DNA and increment in caspase-3 activity indicating apoptosis were clearly observed in both
human gynecologic and colon cancer cells treated with P. watsonii especially with PPWH-7. The study also indicated that P.
watsonii extracts arrested cell cycle at different growth phases in SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells. Cytotoxic and apoptotic
potential of the endemic P. watsonii was investigated for the first time by bioassay-guided approach. These results
demonstrated that P. watsonii selectively inhibits the growth of SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells through apoptosis induction
and cell cycle modulation. Hence, P. watsonii has the potential to be further exploited for the discovery and development of
new anti cancer drugs.

Introduction
There is a long history in the usage of plants in Southeast Asian
countries, some of which have been proven to possess interesting
biological activities with potential therapeutic applications [1].
The use of plants as medicine has resulted in the isolation and
characterization of pharmacologically active compounds [2] and
today there are at least 120 distinct chemical substances derived
from plants that are considered as important drugs and active
ingredients in the pharmaceutical industry [3].
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in both developed
and developing countries and continues to be a major public
health problem in many parts of the world [4]. Much effort has
been made to develop various approaches to reduce the threat
caused by cancer and only modest progress has been made in
reducing the morbidity and mortality of this dreadful disease [5].
According to the world cancer report released by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer, globally there were 12.4 million
new cancer cases in 2008 (6,672,000 in men and 5,779,000 in
women) and 7.6 million deaths from cancer (4,293,000 in men and
3,300,000 in women) [6]. At present, cancer treatment by
chemotherapeutic agents, surgery and radiation have not been
fully effective against the high incidence or low survival rate of
most cancers [7]. The search for new anti cancer agents from plant
sources is one of the realistic and promising approaches in the field
of cancer chemoprevention and this led to the discovery of many
novel anti cancer drugs, including vinca alkaloids, vinblastine and
vincristine, taxol, camptothecins, and podophyllotoxins [8].
Approaches have also been taken towards discovering anti cancer
agents from tropical plants [2] as alternative cancer remedies
because of their low toxicities and costs [9].
During the last few decades, many studies have indicated that
the mechanism of action of many anti cancer drugs is based on
apoptosis induction, and thus opening a new strategy in the search
of anti cancer drugs [10]. An apoptotic induction is a highly
desirable characteristic of treatment strategy for cancer control, it
is therefore important to screen apoptotic inducers from plants,
either in the form of crude extracts or as component compounds
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34793[11]. These kinds of studies must be done by evaluating the
cytotoxicity and apoptotic induction in cancer cell lines before
whole animal studies or clinical trials were carried out.
Phyllanthus watsonii Airy Shaw is a small shrub growing to about
1 m high and belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae (Figure 1). The
species is a narrow endemic and is only known to occur from
northern Johor to southern Pahang (two states in Peninsular
Malaysia) on the banks of Endau River [1,12]. A number of
studies have shown that extracts and compounds derived from
other Phyllanthus species could suppress the growth of various
cancers including cervical [13]; liver [14], lung [15], macrophages
[16], uterine, gastric [17], breast and colon cancer [18]. However,
there were no detailed study been carried out to evaluate the
cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of P. watsonii on human cancer cell
lines, except one report demonstrating the effect of the aqueous
and methanol extract of P. watsonii against MeWo skin melanoma
cells and PC-3 prostate cancer cells [19]. Phytochemistry studies
revealed the presence of two new unsaturated nor-triterpenes (26-
nor-D:A-friedoolean-14-en-3-one and 26-nor-D:A-friedoolean-14-
en-3beta-ol), lupenyl palmitate, friedelin, epifriedelanol, glochi-
done, glochidonol, lupeol, lup-20(29)-en-1 beta, 3 beta-diol,
sitosterol and sitosterol-beta-(D)-glucoside in P. watsonii [20].
The present study was carried out to evaluate the cytotoxic
potential of methanol, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of P.
watsonii against human gynecologic and colon cancer cell lines.
MRC-5, a normal human lung fibroblast cell line was also used to
determine the specificity of the extracts for cancerous cells. MRC-
5 cells have been commonly used as a control in many similar
studies [21–23]. Bioassay-guided fractionation was also carried out
in order to determine the bioactive secondary metabolites with
cytotoxic properties. To our knowledge, this will be the first time
such extracts and fractions from P. watsonii are being tested against
these cell lines. In addition the apoptotic process associated with
the cytotoxic effect in these cells was also investigated.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All necessary permits and permission for collection of materials
were obtained for the described field studies and the party involved
is duly acknowledged. The species (Phyllanthus watsonii) is located in
the Endau Rompin National Park which belongs to the state
government of Johor and managed by the Johor National Parks
Corporation (JNPC), Malaysia. The species is not endangered and
the habitat is not threatened and it is also not listed in the
appendices of CITES (Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).
Plant Materials
The leaves of Phyllanthus watsonii were collected from Endau
Rompin National Park, Johor (Peninsular Malaysia) in June 2008.
Authentication of P. watsonii was carried out in the herbarium of
the Rimba Ilmu Botanical Garden, Institute of Biological Sciences,
University of Malaya and a voucher material (Ref. No.
KLU46068) for this study was deposited at the same herbarium.
Preparation of Extracts from P. watsonii
The dried leaves of P. watsonii (PW) (2 kg) were ground and
extracted with methanol (MeOH) (Fisher Scientific, UK) (6 L 63
times) at room temperature for 72 hours and filtered through
Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Whatman, England). The MeOH
filtrate was collected and excess solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) at
40uC to dryness producing 160.3 g of dark-greenish MeOH
extract (PW-M). Part of the MeOH extract was reserved for the
assay while the remaining portion was further shaken vigorously
with hexane (Fisher Scientific, UK) until the resultant hexane
became almost colorless. The hexane soluble solution was filtered
and pooled, followed by concentration under reduced pressure by
a rotary evaporator to yield 6.5 g of hexane extract (PW-H). The
remaining hexane insoluble was subjected to solvent-solvent
extraction with a mixture of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (Fisher
Scientific, UK) and distilled water (1:1, v/v) followed by fairly
vigorous mixing. This mixture was then successively fractionated
using a separating funnel in which two distinct layers formed. The
bottom layer (water layer) was discarded while the EtOAc phase
(top layer) was released into a clean beaker. This filtrate was
concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to
yield 9.7 g of EtOAc extract (PW-E). In all experiments, extracts
were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) as stock
solution and stored at 220uC. Prior to analysis, the final
concentration of each sample was prepared by diluting the stock
solution in 10% DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the
cell culture was ,0.5%. PW-M, PW-H and PW-E of P. watsonii
were further subjected to Neutral Red Uptake assay according to
the procedures described later. PW-H was found to exhibit
strongest cytotoxicity when compared with PW-M and PW-E and
warranted further investigation.
Bioassay-guided Fractionation of PW-H
The cytotoxically active fraction of PW-H (6.1 g) was
chromatographed on a column (4 cm i.d.640 cm length) packed
with silica gel 60 F254, 0.25 mm thickness (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) (160 g). Gradient step elution began with 100% hexane
and polarity of eluting solvent was gradually increased using
acetone (Me2CO) (Fisher Scientific, UK) and MeOH. Eluents of
25 mL volume were collected in numbered vials. The separation
of each eluent was monitored on pre-coated thin layer chroma-
tography (TLC) silica gel 60 F254 plate using n-hexane/acetone
(20:80, v/v) as a developing solvent and the TLC zones were
detected after spraying with p-anisaldehyde reagent and heating at
105uC for 5 – 10 min. The eluents were pooled according to the
similarity of the chemical composition detected on TLC and the
excess solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure using
a rotary evaporator to yield a total of 10 fractions designated as
PWH-1, PWH-2, PWH-3,…….,PWH-8, PWH-9* and PWH-10*
(Figure 2). Fractions PWH-9* and PWH-10* were found to
contain silica gel and were further dissolved in chloroform and
filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Whatman, England)

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34793to remove the silica. Fractions PWH-9 and PWH-10 were
obtained after removing the excess solvent by evaporation to
dryness at 40uC under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator. All
the fractions were further subjected to Neutral Red Uptake assay
(procedures described later) and fractions PWH-4,…..,PWH-8
revealed as the most active fractions in cytotoxic activity.
These fractions (PWH-4,…..,PWH-8) (581.0 mg) were pooled
and further purified with silica column chromatography (2.6 cm
i.d. 6 60 cm length) packed with silica gel 60 F254, 0.25 mm
thickness (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (160 g). Elution began
with 100% hexane and polarity of eluting solvent was gradually
increased using Me2CO and MeOH. Eluents of 25 ml volume
were collected in numbered vials. The separation of each eluent
was monitored on pre-coated thin layer chromatography (TLC)
silica gel 60 F254 plate using n-hexane/acetone (20:80, v/v) as
developing solvent and the TLC zones were detected after
spraying with p-anisaldehyde reagent and heating at 105uC for
5 – 10 min. The eluents were pooled according to the similarity of
the chemical composition detected on TLC and the excess solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator
to yield a total of 8 sub-fractions designated as PPWH-1, PPWH-
2,…..,PPWH-8. The sub-fractions were subjected to Neutral Red
Uptake assay as described later. The solvent system profile and the
yield of each fractions and sub-fractions obtained are summarized
in Table 1.
Subsequently, cytotoxically active extracts (PW-M, PW-H and
PW-E) and most active sub-fraction (PPWH-7) were selected and
further evaluated for its apoptotic effect towards the gynecologic
and colon cancer cell lines.
LCMS-MS Analysis
The most active sub-fraction, PPWH-7 was analyzed by LC-
MS/MS system equipped with the 3200 QTrap mass spectrom-
eter (Applied Biosystem, Darmstadt, Germany) and Shidmazu
UHPLC system. The chromatographic separation was performed
on a 50 mm62.0 mm65 mM Aqua C18 column (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA), eluted with a mobile phase consisting of water (A)
and acetonitrile (B) containing 0.2% formic acid and 2 mM
ammonium formate. A gradient elution (starting from 10% of A to
90% of B, from 0.01 min to 10.0 min, hold for 2 min and back
to 10% of A in 0.1 min and re-equilibrated for 5 min) was used to
separate the compounds of interest prior to mass spectral analysis.
The mass spectrometer analysis was performed in a positive ion
mode (m/z M + H
+) for detection of secondary compounds.
Identities of the compounds were obtained by matching their
molecular ions (m/z) obtained by LC-MS/MS with reference

published data on chemical constituents from Phyllanthus [24–30].
Cell Culture
The human cell lines SKOV-3 (ovarian carcinoma cell line),
Ca Ski (epidermal carcinoma of cervix cell line), HT-29 (colon
cancer cell line) and MRC-5 (normal lung fibroblast cell line)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), USA. SKOV-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Sigma, UK), whereas HT-
29, Ca Ski and MRC-5 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Sigma, UK) and DMEM medium (Sigma, UK),
respectively. All the media were supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Lab., Austria), 100 U/mL of
penicillin and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (PAA Lab., Austria)
and cells were incubated at 37uC with 5% CO2 in a humidified
atmosphere (Shel Lab., USA).
Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) Assay
The cytotoxicity of P. watsonii extracts, fractions and sub-
fractions were measured by Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay
which was based on the uptake and subsequent lysosomal
accumulation of the supravital dye, neutral red in the viable and
uninjured cells. The quantification of the dye extracted from the
cells has shown to be linear with the cell numbers, both by direct
cell count and by protein determinations of cell population [31].
Cells were seeded in a 96-well micro titer plate (Nunc, Denmark)
at a concentration of 30,000 cells/mL and placed in a CO2
incubator at 37uC to allow the cells to adhere before addition of
the the extracts, fractions and sub-fractions of P. watsonii. After 3
hours, cells were treated with extracts and fractions of P. watsonii at
six different concentrations i.e., 1, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/mL
and incubated for 72 hours. Wells containing untreated cells
(without addition of any extract) were regarded as a negative
control, whereas cells treated with doxorubicin (0.5–10 mg/mL)
served as a positive control. At the end of the incubation period,
the medium was replaced with medium containing 50 mg/mL
Neutral Red (NR) solution (50 mg/mL NR in culture media, 24
hours pre-incubated in the dark at room temperature and then
centrifuge at 1500 g for 10 min before use) and incubated for
further 3 hours to allow for uptake of the vital dye into the
lysosomes of viable and uninjured cells. The medium was then
removed and cells were rapidly washed with the calcium chloride-
formaldehyde mixture. The dye within viable cells was eluted from
the cells with a mixture of acetic acid, ethanol and water (1:50:49)
(0.2 ml). The plates were agitated on a micro titer plate shaker (LT
BioMax 500) for 30 min and then absorbance against a blank
reference was measured at 540 nm using a micro plate reader
(Emax, Molecular Devices, USA).
NR uptake, proportional to the number of viable cells within the
well, was expressed as a percentage of uptake by control cells
[(ODcontrol –O D sample)/(ODcontrol) 6 100%]. IC50 values
(concentration required to reduce cells viability by 50% as
compared to the control cells) for each extract was extrapolated
from the graphs plotted using the OD values obtained. In order to
investigate whether the cytotoxic activity was specific to the cancer
cells, the cytotoxic activity of the extracts, fractions and sub-
fraction was tested and the selectivity index (SI) of active extract
was determined. The selectivity index (SI) of the extracts is defined
as the ratio of cytotoxicity (IC50 values) on normal lung fibroblast
(MRC-5) cells to cancer cells (SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29).
(SI=IC50 on MRC-5 cells/IC50 on cancer cells). Samples with an
SI greater than 3 were considered to have high selectivity towards
cancer cells [32].
Detection of Apoptosis
Morphological assessment of apoptotic cells by phase-
contrast inverted microscope. Cells (3610
4 cells/mL) were
incubated for 24 hours in the absence or presence of PW-M, PW-
H and PW-E of P. watsonii and sub-fraction PPWH-7 at
concentrations of 10.0 mg/mL in 24-well tissue culture plates. At
the end of the incubation period, the media was removed and cells
were washed once with a phosphate buffer saline (PBS pH 7.4)
and observed under a Leica DMI 3000B phase-contrast inverted
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) at 2006
magnifications and photographed.
Morphological assessment of apoptotic cells by acridine
orange (AO)-ethidium bromide (EB) double staining. Cell
morphological changes were assessed by differential staining using
DNA-intercalate fluorescent dyes, acridine orange (AO) and
ethidium bromide (EB). Cells (3610
6 cells/mL) were seeded in
24-well tissue culture plates, treated with PW-M, PW-H, and PW-
E and PPWH-7 at concentration of 10.0 mg/mL and incubated
for 24 hours. Untreated cells were used as a negative control. After
incubation, control and treated cells were pelleted and suspended
in 25 ml of PBS pH 7.4. To each sample, 1 ml of AO/EB solution
(1 part of 100 mg/mL of AO in PBS; 1 part of 100 mg/mL of EB
in PBS) was added prior to microscopic examination. The cell
suspension was placed on a 3-well Teflon coated microscopic
slides, covered with a glass cover slip, and was observed and
photographed with a Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon, NY) under

DNA Fragmentation Analysis by Agarose Electrophoresis
Cells were treated in the presence or absence of PW-M, PW-
H, PW-E and PPWH-7 (1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 mg/mL) for 48
hours, then harvested by using 500 ml lyses buffer [50 mM Tris-
HCL (pH 8.0), 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1.43 ml of Tergitol
H
solution Type NP-40, and 20 ml of SDS 10%] at 65uC for
30 min on ice. Subsequent steps were carried out on ice. 100 ml
of 8 M potassium acetate was added to the suspended mixtures
and incubated on ice for 1 hour. The supernatant was obtained
by centrifuging the lysates at 10,000 6g for 10 min (Heraeus
PICO 17, Thermo Scientific, USA) and the soluble proteins were
extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (PCI; 25:24:1,
v/v/v) (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Finally, DNA was pre-
cipitated using 26 volume of ice-cold absolute ethanol. To
perform the DNA fragmentation assay, the DNA pellet was
dissolved in 20 ml of TE buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0] together with 1 ml of RNAse (10 mg/mL) and
1 ml of Proteinase K (100 mg/mL) and incubated at 37uC for
30 min. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis. DNA bands were observed and photographed
using a Gene Flash gel documentation system (Syngene
Bioimaging, UK). Apoptosis induction is indicated by the
appearance of DNA ladder fragments of approximately 180–
200 bp multiples on the agarose gel.
Caspase-3 Activity Assay
Activity of caspase-3 was determined using the Caspase-3/
CPP32 colorimetric assay kit (Biovision, CA) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. The assay is based on spectrophotomet-
ric detection of the chromophore, p-nitroanilide (pNA), after its
cleavage from the labeled substrate DEVD-pNA. Cells (2610
6)
were pelleted and lysed after treatment with the 10 mg/mL of PW-
M, PW-H, and PW-E of P. watsonii and sub-fraction PPWH-7 for
48 hours. Assays were performed on 96-well microtiter plates by
incubating 100 mg protein of cell lysate per sample in 50 mlo f2 6
reaction buffer. The reaction buffer is supplemented with 10 mM
DTT and substrates of 4 mM DEVD-pNA in a final volume
totaling to 100 ml and incubated at 37uC for 1.5 hours. Formation
of p-nitroanilide was measured using the ELISA micro-plate
reader at a wavelength of 405 nm and the caspase activities were
expressed as percentage of enzyme activity compared with control
(untreated cells).
Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
To compare the effects of extract PW-H and sub-fraction
PPWH-7 on the cell cycle, the CycleTEST
TM PLUS DNA
Reagent Kit (Becton Dickinson, USA) was used. The cells
(1610
6 cells/mL) were seeded in a 6-well plate and treated with
10 mg/mL of PW-H and sub-fraction PPWH-7. After 24 hours
incubation, the cells were harvested, brought to suspension,
permeabilized with trypsin buffer. The nuclear DNA was labeled
with propidium iodide (PI) stain solution and incubated in the dark
between 2u to 8uC for 10 min. Cell cycle phase distribution of
nuclear DNA was determined by flow cytometry (Becton
Dickinson FACS Calibur, USA) by analyzing at least 10,000 cells
per sample. The percentage of cells in G1, S and G2 phases were
analyzed by ModFit LT software (Verity Software House,
Topsham, ME).
Statistical Analyses
Data was presented as mean 6 standard deviation. Significant
differences were determined by using the Student’s t-test where *p
, 0.05 denotes a statistically significant difference. All the samples
were measured in triplicates.
Results
Cytotoxicity of P. watsonii Extracts-NRU Assay
In the present study, the potential cytotoxic effects (IC50)o fP.
watsonii extract in methanol (PW-M), hexane (PW-H) and ethyl
acetate (PW-E) as well as fractions and sub-fractions of PW-H
were investigated on two human gynecologic cancer cells (SKOV-
3 and Ca Ski), one colon cancer cells (HT-29) and one normal cells
(MRC-5) by using the NRU assay. Based on the US National
Cancer Institute guidelines, a crude extract is generally considered
to have in vitro cytotoxic activity if the IC50 value in carcinoma
cells, following incubation between 48 and 72 hours, is #20 mg/
mL, while for a pure compound the IC50 value is #4 mg/mL [33–
34]. Cytotoxic activity (IC50) and selectivity index of the extracts,
fractions and sub-fractions are summarized in Table 2. In
addition, doxorubicin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug
for the treatment of acute leukemia, lymphomas and different
types of solid tumors such as breast, liver and lung cancers [35],
was used as a positive control in the experiments. P. watsonii
extracts exhibited greatest cytotoxic activity on all cancer cells
tested where all showed IC50 values ,20 mg/mL. The most
promising and most selective cytotoxic activities were detected in
PW-H and PW-E. The IC50 (mg/mL) and SI values with PW-H on
SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells were 5.79 6 0.29 (SI=9.9),
6.94 6 0.96 (SI=8.3) and 11.79 6 1.61 (SI=4.9), respectively.
Whereas the values with PW-E were 5.52 6 0.50 (SI=6.1), 3.58
6 1.01 (SI=9.4) and 5.14 6 0.36 (SI=6.6), respectively. PW-H
was selected for the bioassay-guided fractionation as it showed the
strongest cytotoxic effect on cancer cells and was the least toxic on
normal cells compared to PW-M and PW-E. These are the criteria
normally considered to justify further purification of the extract
[36].
Bioassay-guided Fractionation-NRU Assay
Column chromatography (CC) of the PW-H yielded a total of
10 fractions. Fractions of PW-H demonstrated stronger cytotoxic
activity and higher selectivity when compared to the PW-H
particularly when tested on SKOV-3 cells (Table 2). On SKOV-3
cells, the fractions PWH-4, PWH-5, PWH-6, PWH-7 and PWH-8
exhibited IC50 values of 0.29 6 0.06 (SI=56.0), 0.18 6 0.06
(SI=68.1), 0.42 6 0.12 (SI=18.7), 0.77 6 0.29 (SI=10.4) and
0.36 6 0.12 (SI=23.0) mg/mL, respectively. IC50 values obtained
when Ca Ski and HT-29 cells were treated with the fractions
PWH-4 – PWH-8 were between the range of 2.77–13.19 and
1.21–10.78 mg/mL, respectively. The fractions PWH-4 to PWH-8
were obtained from the mid portion of the silica column (hexane/
Me2CO: 40:60/50:50) and this shows that the presence of highly
cytotoxic compounds were at the intermediate polarity phase.
These fractions were pooled and subjected to the second step of
bioassay-guided fractionation and yielded 8 sub-fractions. PPWH-
7 was the most cytotoxic and exhibited higher selectivity (SI) on Ca
Ski and HT-29 cells with IC50 (mg/mL) and SI values of 0.83 6
0.00 (SI=12.8) and 0.83 6 0.10 (SI=12.8), respectively (Table 2).
On the contrary, purified sub-fraction PPWH-7 demonstrated
lower cytotoxic and selectivity effect on SKOV-3 cells (IC50=0.66
6 0.06 mg/mL; SI=15.5) compared to the fractions PWH-4
(IC50=0.29 6 0.06 mg/mL; SI=56.0), PWH-5 (IC50=0.18 6
0.06 mg/mL; SI=68.1), PWH-6 (IC50=0.42 6 0.12 mg/mL;

is worth mentioning that PPWH-7 showed similar cytotoxic
activity as the standard anticancer drug, doxorubicin which was
used as a positive control in the present study. However
doxorubicin also exhibited high toxicity on MRC-5 normal cells
whereas PPWH-7 showed about 6 times lower toxicity on the
MRC-5 normal cells.
LCMS/MS Analysis
Sub-fraction PPWH-7 was analyzed by LC-MS/MS system
and at least 15 compounds were present in PPWH-7 of which 7
compounds with retention times of major peaks were identified
through mass spectrometry (Table 3). An example of the LC-MS/
MS analysis showing a positive full spectra chromatogram of one
of the detected compound (ellagic acid in sub-fraction PPWH-7)
in a positive ion mode (EPI mode) is shown in Figure 3. The
major peak with a retention time of 13.99 min was identified as
methyl ester of geraiinic acid (MS m/z = 397), and potassium
phyllanthin (MS m/z = 457). Phyllanthin was also identified as
sodium phyllanthin (MS m/z = 441) at a retention time of
11.66 min. Another major peak was identified as sterol glucoside
(MS m/z = 718), an isoprenoids at retention time of 9.39 min.
Two triterpene were eluted at retention time of 10.20 min and
13.45 min and were identified as glochidone (MS m/z = 423) and
betulin (MS m/z = 443), respectively. A polyphenolic compound
identified as trimethyl ether of ellagic acid (MS m/z = 345) was
eluted at retention time of 7.77 min (Figure 4).
Morphological Assessment of Apoptotic Cells by Phase-
contrast Inverted Microscope
Morphological observation of untreated SKOV-3, Ca Ski and
HT-29 cells showed that the control cells maintained their original
morphology which are cuboids and polygonal in their shape and
were adherent to the plates (Figure 5). In contrast, SKOV-3, Ca
Ski and HT-29 cells-treated with PW-M, PW-H, and PW-E and
PPWH-7 exhibited apoptotic-like characteristics such as shrinkage
of cells, bleb formation and nuclear chromatin condensation and
aggregation into dense masses beneath the nuclear membrane.
Cells undergoing apoptosis also resulted in other types of
morphological changes such as shrinkage of rounded up cells
and losing contact with neighboring cells. As a result, some
sensitive cells even detached from the surface of the well plates.

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34793PPWH-7 for 24 hours were observed by AO/EB staining and the
cells were classified as live (normal), apoptotic and necrotic
(Figure 6). Live cells with intact DNA and nucleus will have
a round and green nuclei. Apoptotic cells will have condensed
chromatin which gives several green colored nuclei and the DNA
of the necrotic cells would be stained bright orange. As shown in
Figure 4, the nucleus of the control cells was smoother and
uniformly bright green together with the cytoplasm. Cells treated
with extracts and sub-fraction exhibited characteristic changes and
showed signs of apoptosis, i.e., cell shrinkage, nuclear condensa-
tion and fragmentation. The nucleus of the treated cells shown as
bright green with highly condensed chromatin is uniformly
fluorescent. The condensed chromatin can be observed in the
form of crescents around the periphery of the nucleus or the entire
chromatin is present as one or a group of featureless, bright
spherical beads. The number of cells stained bright orange were
generally very low in all the treatments which indicated that most
of cells were not undergoing necrosis but cell death occurred
primarily through apoptosis.
DNA Fragmentation Analysis by Agarose Electrophoresis
An important feature of cell apoptosis is the fragmentation of
genomic DNA into integer multiples of 180–200 bp units
producing a characteristic ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis

Apoptosis Induction of Phyllanthus watsonii
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34793[37]. To elucidate whether PW-M, PW-H and PW-E and PPWH-
7 decrease cell survival by the induction of DNA fragmentation,
genomic DNA isolated from SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells
were exposed to different concentrations of extracts, electrophor-
esed and photographed (Figure 7). Typical DNA ladder formation,
a hallmark of apoptosis, can be seen clearly in the SKOV-3 cells
treated with PW-H and PW-E and in the Ca Ski cells treated with
PW-M, PW-E and PPWH-7. The DNA ladder was observed less
clearly in all the treated HT-29 cells as there were interspersing
smear in the lanes. The smearing could be due to some post-
apoptotic cell necrosis. In comparison, the DNA from untreated
cells did not exhibit any fragmentation or smearing.
Activation of Caspase-3
To ascertain whether the cytotoxic activity could be dependent
by the activation of caspase-3 which plays a central role in
mediating apoptotic responses [38], we measured the intracellular
levels of caspase-3 in SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells after being
induced with studied extracts. Following 48 hours treatment of
SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells with various concentrations of
PW-M, PW-H, PW-E and PPWH-7, caspase-3 activities were
measured and compared with control cells (Figure 8). As shown,
SKOV-3 cells treated with PW-M, PW-H, PW-E and PPWH-7
exhibited a dramatic increment in caspase-3 activity ranging from
1.9 to 3.5-folds higher compared to untreated cells. The activity in
PW-M and PW-E was 3.5 and 2.9-folds higher than untreated
cells, respectively. These values are even higher than the
doxorubicin-treated cells which had only 2.5-folds increase in
activity. The caspase-3 activity increased slightly (1.7-folds) in all
Ca Ski cells treated with PW-M, PW-H, PW-E and PPWH-7. In
HT-29 cells, treatment with PW-E caused the highest increment in
caspase-3 activity (2.3-folds) followed by PW-H (2.0-folds) and
PW-M and PPWH-7 (1.8-folds).
Effects on Cell Cycle Regulation
Since PW-H and sub-fraction PPWH-7 exhibited the most
promising cytotoxicity and shown to be quite selective for cancer
cells (Table 2), we next analyzed the regulation of cell cycle
distribution in the presence of PW-H and PPWH-7 in SKOV-3,
Ca Ski and HT-29 cells by flow cytometry. Interestingly, SKOV-3
cells exhibited a dramatic accumulation of cells in S and G2/M
phases and a concomitant decrease of the percentage of cells in
G0/G1 phase, suggesting that both PW-H and PPWH-7 induced
SKOV-3 cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases (Figure 9).
Significant increment from 5.5 6 0.50% (control) to 26.4 6 0.87%
and 0.8 6 0.20% (control) to 12.3 6 0.64% were observed in S
and G2/M phases (p,0.05), respectively in PW-H-treated cells.
Whereas, significant increment from 5.5 6 0.50% (control) to 25.3
6 1.16% (p,0.05) in S phase and 0.8 6 0.20% (control) to 16.5 6
0.60% (p,0.05) in G2/M phase were also been observed in
PPWH-7-treated cells. In the PW-H-treated Ca Ski cells, the
number of cells in G0/G1 phase was 93.0 6 1.11% compared to
control cells (76.3 6 0.81%) (p,0.05). Whereas treatment with
PPWH-7 significantly increased the proportions of S phase cells
from 13.6 6 0.60% (control) to 29.6 6 1.27% (p,0.05). These
results provided evidence that the observed apoptotic cell death
was partly due to the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 and S phase
induced by PW-H and PPWH-7, respectively. PW-H and PPWH-
7 significantly increased the percentage of HT-29 cells in G0/G1
phase (74.5 6 1.26% and 88.5 6 0.57%) (p,0.05), respectively, as
compared with the control cells (72.6 6 1.60%), indicating that
PW-H and PPWH-7-induced HT-29 cell cycle arrest in G0/G1

Discussion
In the current work, extracts of P. watsonii in different solvents
from non-polar to polar (MeOH, hexane and EtOAc) demon-
strated strong cytotoxicity and high sensitivity towards both of the
human gynecologic and colon cancer cells as compared to the
normal lung fibroblast cells. These conclusions are drawn based on
the lower IC50 values (#20.0 mg/mL) and higher SI values (.3)
that were obtained. These results suggest that compounds from P.
watsonii may serve as a promising new experimental anti cancer
agent for the treatment of human cancers. However, as our
current studies were focused on in vitro investigation of extracts/
fractions effects, further research might include exploration of its
effects in animal tumor models to confirm its anti cancer activity
in vivo.
Bioassay-guided fractionation approach which has been recog-
nized as an important method in the attempt to isolate bioactive
components from natural sources [39] was used to isolate the most
effective constituents from P. watsonii that were capable in
inhibiting the growth of the human gynecologic and colon cancer
cells. The bioassay-guided fractionation of PW-H revealed that
cytotoxic compounds were found mainly in the middle polarity
phase of the solvent system used (n-hexane/acetone phase). It can
be concluded that the non-polar compounds of P. watsonii potently
inhibited the in vitro cell proliferation of SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-
29. PPWH-7 was the most cytotoxically active sub-fraction and
showed similar cytotoxic activity as the standard anti cancer drug,
doxorubicin which was used as a positive control in the present
study. US National Cancer Institute assigns that a pure compound

#4 mg/mL [33–34]. The IC50 values established for PPWH-7
ranged from 0.66–0.83 mg/mL, a highly cytotoxic activity when
considering a pure compound and these findings strongly suggest
the promising potential of P. watsonii to be developed as an anti
cancer drug. Variations in the cytotoxic activities among the
fractions and sub-fractions against the cancer cells studied were
also observed and this could be attributed to the distribution of the
several identified cytotoxic compounds in different fractions/sub-
fractions. In the present study, it also been clearly observed that
fraction PWH-4, PWH-5, PWH-6 and PWH-8 exhibited a higher
degree of cytotoxic acivity than purified sub-fraction PPWH-7

an increased cytotoxic activity and higher selectivity towards Ca
Ski and HT-29 cells, the reason for the decreased cytotoxic activity
towards SKOV-3 cells remains to be determined. Synergism
between the components and/or the presence of other minor
active compound(s) is more likely to have caused the observed
cytotoxicity of the fractions and sub-fraction. Further experiments
are required to confirm this hypothesis with the cytotoxic activity
of the fractions and sub-fraction of P. watsonii towards SKOV-3
cells.

Apoptosis Induction of Phyllanthus watsonii
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34793At present, LC-MS is one of the most sensitive analytical
methods to yield information about the molecular weight as well
as the structure of the analyst [40]. Analysis of the PPWH-7
using LC-MS/MS indicated the presence of trimethyl ether of
ellagic acid, methyl ester of geraiinic acid, glochidone, betulin,
Phyllanthin sodium salt, Phyllanthin potassium salt and sterol
glucoside and some of these detected compounds have been
shown to have anti cancer activities. Based on this information,
we conjecture that the observed cytotoxic activity in P. watsonii
may be due to the presence of some of these compounds. Plant-
derived ellagic acid has previously been identified as a potent
anti cancer agent [41–44] with suggested molecular targets for
ellagic acid effects being NF-kB, cyclin D1, p21
cip1/waf1 and p53
[45]. Many studies have shown that ellagic acid possessed
growth-inhibiting and apoptosis promoting activities against
various human cancer cell lines representing different tissues
such as Ca Ski cervical carcinoma cells [46], Caco-2 colon cells,
MCF-7 breast cells and Hs 578T breast cells, DU 145 prostatic
cells [47] and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells [48]. Anti cancer
potential of geraiinic acid, a compound under the chemical class
of monoterpene [49] has not been reported but there are
numerous studies on the cytotoxicity of monoterpenes and its
derivatives [50–54]. Anti tumor activity of betulin, also known as
betulinol, betuline and betulinic acid and its derivatives could be
therapeutically important, because these compounds exhibit high
cytotoxic activity against several cancer cells. Betulin was found
to be cytotoxic against neuroblastoma cell lines [55], triggered
apoptotic cascade in human malignant glioma cells [56] and
inhibited the growth of neoplastic cell lines, such as ovarian
carcinoma (A2780, OVCAR-5 and IGROV-1), lung carcinoma
(H460 and POGB) and cervix carcinoma (A431) [57]. Phyl-
lanthin, a lignan compound, is a known principal constituent of
P. niruri and there have been no data reported on its cytotoxic
effect. Sterol glucoside was also been detected in PPWH-7 and
sterols isolated from various marine organisms and alga was
reported to possess cytotoxic activity [58–60].
Many researchers recognized induction of apoptosis, a pro-
grammed cell death in cancer cells or malignant tissues, as one
of the efficient strategies in cancer chemotherapy and a very
important property of a candidate anti cancer drug [11]. In
order to evaluate whether the cytotoxic effects of PW-M, PW-
H, PW-E and PPWH-7 upon SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells
were related with the apoptotic processes, we investigated the
effects of these test agents on the induction of apoptotic cell
death by various morphological and biochemical methods. All
our study indicated that P. watsonii inhibited the growth of the
human gynecologic and colon cancer cells through apoptosis
induction.
Apoptotic cells were first recognized from the characteristic
changes in their morphology, particularly changes in the
nucleus. Distinct apoptotic morphological changes in treated-
SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells include the rounding up of
cells, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and forma-
tion of apoptotic bodies. These observations were made under
phase-contrast inverted microscope and with AO/EB double
staining by fluorescence microscope. Formation of DNA
fragmentation ladder which correlates with the early morpho-
logical signs of apoptosis [61] has been widely used as
a distinctive marker of the apoptosis process [27]. The typical
ladder-like appearance of DNA in the tested cell lines observed
in our study reconfirmed the apoptosis-inducing capability of
both the extracts and sub-fraction. The induction of apoptosis is
almost always associated with the activation of caspases; the
cytoplasmic aspartate-specific cysteine protease [62–63]. The
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol after being
induced by a variety of apoptosis-inducing agents leads to the
formation of apoptosome composed of cytochrome c, apoptosis
protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), deoxyadenosine triphos-
phate (dATP), and procaspase-9, which forms a platform for the
efficient processing and activation of caspase-9 [64–66].
Activation of caspase-9, in turn, cleaves effectors caspases such
as caspase-3, -6, and -7 [66]. Caspase-3 activates other caspases,
Figure 8. Caspase-3 activity in cancer cells was analyzed using Caspase-3/CPP32 Colorimetric Assay Kit. Multiple increases in caspase-3
activity in cells after treatment with 10 mg/mL of extracts for 48 hours and was determined by comparing the results with control. The values are
expressed as means 6 SD in three independent experiments. Significant differences were compared between control and treated cells (*p,0.05).

Apoptosis Induction of Phyllanthus watsonii
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34793cleaves cytoskeletal proteins, or activates the caspase-activated
DNase. In particular, caspase-3 cleaves an inhibitor of caspase-
activated DNase that allows caspase-activated DNase to enter
the nucleus and to fragment nuclear DNA and culminate in the
orderly demise of the cell [67]. The present study indicated that
following the addition of extract of P. watsonii sub-fraction
PPWH-7, SKOV-3, Ca Ski and HT-29 cells displayed an
increment in the activity of caspase-3. Many plants as well as
other Phyllanthus species extracts have shown to induce apoptosis
in various cell types by inducing the activity of caspase-3 protein
[68–70] and this is the first report on P. watsonii.
Cell cycle is an essential process in the development,
differentiation, and proliferation of mammalian cells [71]. Since
deregulation of the cell cycle machinery has been associated with
cancer initiation and progression [72], suppression of the cell cycle
has become an appreciated target for management and treatment
of tumor cells with cytotoxic agents [71]. It has been reported that
many anti cancer agents arrest cell cycle at the G0/G1, S or G2/M
phases and then induce apoptotic cell death [73–76]. Our data
suggest that PW-H and PPWH-7 induced cell cycle arrest at S-
G2/M phase in SKOV-3 cells and at G0/G1 phase in HT-29 cells.
Whereas in Ca Ski cells, PW-H induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1-
G2/M phases and PPWH-7 at S phase. Cell cycle progression is
regulated by the activity of cyclins, a family of proteins that
activate the cell-cycle-dependent kinases (Cdks) [77]. Cyclin A is
required for the S phase and passage through G2 phase and cyclin
E activates cdk2 protein near the start of the S phase [78]. Cyclin
D1 is known to bind and activate cdk4, which is largely involved in
controlling the G1/S restricting point whereas the G2/M
transition is positively regulated by the cdk2 and cyclin B complex
[79]. Cdk-cyclin complexes are negatively controlled by the Kip/
Cip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), namely
p27
Kip1 and p21
Cip1 [80]. In order to elucidate the mechanism of
action of extract on cell cycle and the changes of multiple
regulatory molecules in the cell cycle, further work should be
carried out.
In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates for the first time
that the sub-fraction of P. watsonii strongly inhibits the growth and
induces apoptosis in human gynecologic and colon cancer cells.
Additional studies are warranted to understand the interaction
mechanism involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway induced
by P. watsonii. Further studies on the isolation of pure compound(s)
and chemical characterization of the cytotoxically active com-
pounds of P. watsonii are currently undergoing.
