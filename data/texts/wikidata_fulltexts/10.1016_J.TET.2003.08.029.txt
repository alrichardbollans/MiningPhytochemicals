Abstract—Three nortriterpenoids, notohamosin A (1), B (2) and C (3) with novel skeleton, and eight known compounds were isolated from
the ethanol extract of the whole plants of Notochaete hamosa Benth. (Labiatae). On the basis of spectral evidence including 1D, 2D NMR, IR
and MS data, their structures were elucidated. The relative configurations of compounds 1, 2 and 3 were determined according to NOESY
experiments.

1. Introduction
Notochaete hamosa Benth., one of the two plants of
the genus Notochaete (Labiatae), is distributed in
Southwest China, Nepal, India and Burma at an altitude of
1200–2500 m, and usually found in the edge of sub-tropical
green-forest.1,2 No chemical study on the plants of this
genus was reported. This study led to the isolation of three
new nortriterpenoids, notohamosin A (1), B (2) and C (3)
possessing novel skeleton, and eight known compounds,
b-sitosterol (4),3 shanzhiside (5),4 daucosterol (6),3
3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (7),5 martynoside
(8),6 pinoresinol (9),7 desrhamnosyl acteoside (l0),8 and
acteoside (11).9 Their structures were elucidated by spectral
evidence. The relative configurations of compounds 1, 2 and
3 were determined by NOESY experiments.
2. Results and discussion
The ethanol extract of the whole plants of N. hamosa was
divided into petroleum ether-, EtOAc- and n-BuOH-soluble
fractions. Compounds 1–7 were isolated from the EtOAc-
soluble extract, 8–11 from the n-BuOH-soluble fraction by
column chromatography.
Notohamosin A (1) was obtained as a white powder. The
color of 1 in acetic anhydride changed from red to dark-blue
after being reacted with Liebermann–Burchard reagent.
The molecular formula C29H46O5 was calculated from the
quasi-molecular ion peak at m/z 475.3395 [MþH]þ in
the HRAPCIMS (positive). Twenty-eight signals recog-
nized in the 13C NMR spectrum (DEPT, Table 1) represent
29 C-atoms in view of one overlapped signal which was
confirmed by the HMQC cross signals at d 1.50, 1.35 and
1.90, 1.58/32.7 (t). The 1H NMR signals at d 1.13, 0.84, 0.92
and 1.27 (each 3H, s) indicated four methyl groups at
quaternary carbon atoms (H3-25, H3-26, H3-27 and H3-28)
(Table 1). Three hydroxymethyl groups located on
quaternary C-atoms were postulated from the HMQC
cross signals at d 4.63 and 4.43 (each 1H, d, J¼10.8 Hz,
H2-23)/68.8 (t, C-23), 4.21 and 4.09 (each 1H, d,
J¼11.0 Hz, H2-24)/63.5 (t, C-24), and 3.66 and 3.60 (each
1H, d, J¼10.2 Hz, H2-29)/70.8 (t, C-29). One Z-double
bond (C-11 and C-12) was deduced from 1H NMR signals at
d 5.73 and 6.00 (each 1H, d, J¼10.0 Hz). One tri-substituted
double bond (C-13 and C-18) was provided by the 1H NMR
signal at d 5.52 (1H, s) and 13C NMR signals (DEPT) at d
136.1 (d) and 139.1 (s). The evidence mentioned above led
to the conclusion that compound 1 is a nortriterpene.
Four moieties a, b, c and d were established from 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectral data, and HMQC and HMBC
experiments (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The quaternary carbon
atom resonated at d 44.9 (s) could be assigned to C-17
according to the 1H NMR signal at d 5.52 (1H, s) for H-18.
Thus, skeleton 1A (Fig. 1) was determined.
Another two hydroxyl groups, concluded from molecular
formula, could be located at C-2 and C-3 according to the
HMQC correlation d 4.50 (1H, brd, J¼11.2 Hz, H-2)/66.l

(d, C-2) and 4.91 (1H, s, H-3)/73.7 (d, C-3) and HMBC
correlations between H-3 and C-1, C-2 and C-5. The relative
configurations of C-2, C-3, C-5, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-14, C-17
and C-20 were determined by NOESY experiments (Fig. 1
and Table 1). The 2-OH group should be a-orientated
considering the NOESY correlations between H-2 and
H3-25, and between H-2 and H2-24. The negligible coupling
constant between H-2 and H-3 revealed 3a-OH. The
NOESY correlations between H-5 and H-9, between H-5
and H2-23, and between H-9 and H3-27 indicated a-oriented
H-5, H-9 and H3-27. The relative configuration of C-17 was
determined upon the NOESY cross signals between H3-27
and H2-22. The NOESY correlation between dH 5.52 (H-18)
and dH 1.97 suggested that the proton resonated at dH 1.97
should be a-oriented (H-19a). The key NOESY correlation
between H-19a and H2-29 suggested 20a-CH2OH group
(C-29). Thus, the structure of notohamosin A (1) was
established as that illustrated in Figure 1.
The visualization of notohamosin B (2) with Liebermann–
Buchard reagent was the same as that of 1. The quasi-
molecular ion peak at m/z 459.3454 in the HRAPCIMS
(positive) of 2 provided the molecular formula C29H46O4.
Twenty-nine signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum,
five methyl groups and two hydroxymethyl groups at
quaternary C-atoms recognized from the 1H NMR spectrum
suggested that 2 is also a nortriterpene (Fig. 1 and Table 2).
Comparing the NMR data and MS data of 2 with those of 1,
it is obvious that 2 bears one more methyl group and one
less hydroxymethyl group than 1. C-24 of 2 was not
substituted by a hydroxyl group, which was confirmed by
HMQC correlation at d 0.90 (3H, s, H3-24)/17.1 (q, C-24),
HMBC cross signals between H3-24 and C-4, C-3 and
C-23 (Table 2), as well as NOESY correlations between
H3-24, H-2 and H3-25 (Fig. 1 and Table 2). 2A (Fig. 1)
was postulated on the basis of HMQC and HMBC
experiments. The relative configurations of C-2, C-3, C-4,
C-5, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-14, C-17 and C-20 were determined
to be the same as those in compound 1 based on the NOESY
experiments (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Thus, the structure of 2
(notohamosin B) could be determined as that depicted in
Figure 1.
Notohamosin C (3) was isolated as a white powder. In the
1H NMR spectrum four methyl groups at quaternary C-atom
(H3-25, H3-26, H3-27 and H3-28) resonated at d 1.16, 1.00,
1.02 and 1.04 (each 3H, s) (Table 3). The 1H NMR signals at
d 4.59 and 4.40 (each d, J¼10.5 Hz), 4.22 and 4.07 (each d,
J¼11.0 Hz), as well as 13C NMR signals at d 69.2 (t) and
64.2 (t) (Table 3), could be assigned to two hydroxymethyl
groups at quaternary C-atom. One methoxy group was
deduced from HMQC signal at d 3.36 (3H, s)/54.7 (q). One
tri-substituted double bond (C-12 and C-13) was suggested
by the 1H NMR signal at d 6.07 (IH, t, J¼2.0 Hz) and 13C

NMR signals (DEPT) at d 119.2 (d) and 138.5 (s). The
quasi-molecular ion peak [MþH]þ at m/z 505.3515 in
HRAPCIMS gave the molecular formula C30H48O6. From
1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMBC and HMQC (Table 3), structure
3A (Fig. 1) was concluded.
The 13C NMR signal at d 74.6 (d) could be assigned to
oxygenated C-16 in view of the HMQC correlation at d
4.24 (1H, brs, H-16)/74.9 (d, C-16) and HMBC cross
signal at d 1.06 (1H, d, J¼11.0 Hz, Hb-19)/74.9 (d, C-16).
The HMQC signal at d 4.33 (1H, s, H-29)/106.8 (d, C-29)
suggested that C-29 should be an acetal carbon atom.
From the HMBC correlation between H-29 and C-16
and the molecular formula of compound 3, it could be

Y. Luo et al. / Tetrahedron 59 (2003) 8227–8232 8229
concluded that C-16 and C-29 should be connected via
an ether bond. The assignment of ring F was then
achieved according to the key HMBC correlations
derived from H-29 with C-16, C-19 and 29-OCH3,
from H3-28 with C-19, C-20, C-21 and C-29, and from
H-19 with C-16, C-17, C-20, C-21 and C-29.
C-2 and C-3 were found to be substituted by hydroxyl
groups by comparing its 13C NMR data with those of 1. The
relative configurations of C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-8, C-9, C-10
and C-14 were determined to be the same as those in
compound 1 based on the NOESY experiments (Fig. 1 and
Table 3). H-16 and 29-OCH3 should be a-oriented in view
of NOESY correlations between H-16 and H3-27, and
between H-16 and 29-OMe (Fig. 1 and Table 3). The
relative configuration of C-17 was assigned by NOESY
correlation between H-16 and Ha-22. The relative configu-
ration of C-29 could be determined by taking the rigidities
of rings D, E and F into account, which was confirmed by
the key NOESY correlation between H-29 and H3-28.
Therefore, the structure of compound 3 was determined as
shown in Figure 1.
The known compounds, b-sitosterol (4),3 shanzhiside (5),4
daucosterol (6),3 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoic acid
(7),5 martynoside (8),6 pinoresinol (9),7 desrhamnosyl
acteoside (10),8 and acteoside (11)9 were identified by co-
TLC with authentic samples and by comparison of their
spectral data with those reported.

Visualization on TLC was carried out by spraying 8%
phosphomolybdic acid–ethanol solution (w/v) followed by
heating. Fractions from all columns were generally
collected by hand and auto-collect apparatus according to
TLC analyses.
3.2. Plant material
The whole plants of N. hamosa Benth. were collected from
Wuliangshan, Jingdong County, Yunnan Province, China,
in September 1999, and identified by Professor X. W. Li
(Kunming Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences). A voucher specimen (GF-05) is deposited at the
Herbarium of Chengdu Institute of Biology, the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
3.3. Extraction and isolation
A sample of cut and dried whole plants (7.2 kg) was soaked
with 92% ethanol (50 L£3, seven days each time) at room
temperature. After being concentrated in vacuum, ca. 990 g
residue was obtained. The syrup was dissolved in warm
water 2.0 L (about 508C), cooled to room temperature and
successively extracted with petroleum ether (60–908C)
(1.0 L£10), ethyl acetate (1.0 L£10) and n-BuOH
(0.5 L£12).
The EtOAc-partitionated extract (50 g) was divided into five
fractions FrB1-5 by CC gradient eluted with CHCl3/MeOH
(from 20:1, 10:1 to 5:1, elute was combined after TLC
analyses). Compounds 1 (25 mg) and 2 (22 mg) were
obtained from FrB2 by CC repeatedly eluted with petroleum
ether (60–908C):acetone (4:1). 3 (18 mg) was isolated from
FrB3 by CC eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (15:1). FrB1 was
subjected to CC repeatedly eluted with petroleum ether
(60–908C):acetone (4:1) to give compounds 4 (108 mg) and
5 (12 mg). Compound 6 (1.08 g) was precipitated from
FrB5. Compound 7 (36 mg) was isolated from FrB4 by CC
eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (15:1). The n-BuOH extract
(161 g) was dissolved in 1.2 L of warm water (about 508C)
and absorbed on CC packed with macroporus resin (D101).
The CC was eluted by water until no sugar in the elute was
detected, then eluted by MeOH to yield 43 g residue, which
was divided into four fractions FrC1-4 by CC eluted with
CHCl3:MeOH:acetone (4:1:1). Compound 8 (23 mg) was
obtained from FrC1 by CC eluted with CHCl3:MeOH (5:1).
Compound 9 (18 mg) were isolated from FrC2 by CC eluted
with CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (4:1:0.1). FrC3 was first separated
by CC with CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (4:1:0.1), then separated by
