Abstract-High levels of ~methylen~uta~ne accumulate in the roots and Ieaves of Sophora &umca, but no 
detectable amounts of ~methyleu~u~c acid and only trace quantities of 2~x~rn~hyl~eglu~ acid are seen. 4- 
Methyl~u~ acid, however, is present in leaves and roots at a level %25 % of that found for ~rn~y~~u~~ne; 2- 
ox~methylgiu~c acid is the most abundant keto acid detected in 28day leaf extracts, but no ~methyl~u~nc is 
seen. Transamination by pig heart glutamate:oxalacetate aminotransferase of the 2sxo4methy~gh~taric acid that 
occurs in this species yields erythro4methylglutamic acid; the 2-0~0 acid, therefore, has the (4R) configuration. The 4- 
methylglutamic acid isolated from this plant is also the erythro isomer and is probably of the (2S, 4R)configuration. This 
is the first report of the presence of Csubstituted glutamic acids in Sophera and the first instance where high levels of 4- 
methyleneglutamine are present in the absence of detectable levels of 4-methyleneglutamic acid. 
Various Csubstituted glutamic acids and their cor- 
responding derivatives (i.e. the 29x0 analogue and/or the 
y-amide) accumulate in a wide variety of plant species, 
especially in members of the Leguminosae and Liliaceae 
[l]. Of such compounds, 4methyleneglumatic acid (4 
Meglu)* and its amide, 4-methyleneglutamine (CMegln), 
appear to be most widespread. 4-Methylglutamic acid (4 
Mglu) and 4-hydroxy4methylglutamic acid are also 
found in several specks either alone or together with 4 
Meglu and 4-Megtn, and Iimited evidence suggests that 
these substituted amino acids may be meta~li~lly 
interrelated [2,3]. in our efforts to elucidate biosynthetic 
and biodegradative pathways involving 4Meglu (primar- 
ily in Arachis hypoguea), we examined its presence and the 
distribution of related compounds in several other legume 
species. We report here an unusual pattern of 4-sub- 
stituted glutamic acids and amides in seedlings of the 
Japanese pagoda tree, Sophora japnica. 
RESULTS AND DtSCWSON 
Leaves (ca 0.5 g) from a seedling grown in the green- 
house for six weeks were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen 
within one hr, and stored at - 20” for two weeks before 
being extracted. Analysis of these extracts on the amino 
acid analyser suggested the possible presence of two 4- 
substituted glutamic acids-a major constituent eluted at

aminotrandewe, 
the position of 4-Mcglu or 4-Mghr and a minor com- 
ponent coeluted with 4-Megln. When the acidic amino 
acids were fractionated by thin layer chromatography on 
cellulose followed by reaction with ninhydrin, a purple 
spot of the correct mobility confirmed the presence of 4- 
Mglu but no yellow-brown spot characteristic of CMeglu 
was detected. The amino acid which eluted in small 
quantity at the position of Megln stayed in the neutral 
fraction and was not further characterized then. 
Essentially the same pattern was seen with extracts of 
emerging leaves as well as with mature kaves of mature 
plants, although emerging leaves contained ~nside~bly 
lesser amounts of these unusual amino acids compared to 
their content of asparagine, a&tine, and other protein 
ammo acids. 
In all subsequent work, ungerminated seeds and seed 
lings up to eight weeks of age were extracted without prior 
freezing and storage. Such extracts of seedlings contained 
considerably greater amounts of the amino acid eluting at 
the position of CMegln and lesser amounts of QMglu; 
neither of these two compounds was detected in extracts 
of ungerminated seeds (Tabk 1). As can be seen, the level 
of 4Meght is second only to aspartic acid; asparagine, 
glutamine, threonine and serine eluted as one peak in 
these analyses and the size of this combined peak was 
comparable to that for asparticacid. CMglu was routineJy 
detected in all samples anaiysed by cellulose TLC but 4 
MeglU was not. When phenylthiocarbamyl (PTQamino 
acids were analysed by the pica-tag method [4], the PTC- 
derivatives of rghnamic acid and ~4Meglu eluted at 
1.87 and 2.08 min, respectively, whereas the PTC- 
derivative of synthetically-prepared 4-Mglu (containing 
the eryrhro-r>t and tkreo-DL diastereoisomers) eluted as 
nearly equal size peaks (3:2 ratio) at 2.23 and 2.42 min.

Sophoro extracts as their PTCderivatives showed only the 
peak at 2.23 min in an amount comparable to that 
determined by ion-exchange amino acid analysis; no peak 
corresponding to CMeglu (i.e. at 2.08 min) was ever seen 
in samples examined by this method. On the other hand, 
the acidic amino acid fraction obtained after hydrolysis of 
the neutral ammo acids contained 4-Meglu in an amount 
equal to that determined for 4-Meghr in the original 
unhydrolysed sample. In such analyses, no CMglu was 
detected either by TLC or p&-tag analyses indicating 
that no 4-methylglutamine (or other y-glutamyl derivat- 
ive) was present. 
Although we did not isolate CMglu in sufficient 
quantity from S. japonico to be able to determine directly 
its configuration nor were any of the individual 
syntheti~iy-prearm isomers available to us, the follow- 
ing indirect results suggest the natural plant ammo acid is 
the erythro isomer. First, as noted earlier, synthetically- 
prepared 4-Mglu is resolved into its two diastereoisomers 
by the pica-tag system and the product isolated from 
S. japonica coelutes with the faster-eluting dia- 
stereoisomer. Blake and Fowden [SJ reported that 
erythro4Mglu cyclizes faster to the pyrrolidone when 
heated at pH 3 than does the threo isomer. We found that 
on heating the mixture of synthetically prepared dia- 
stereoisomers under these conditions, the fastercluting 
form disappears more rapidly (Fig. 1) suggesting that it is 
the erytlrro isomer. It was also observed that erythro-4- 
Mglu migrated more slowly than the three isomer when 
subjected to paper chro~to~phy in 2-methylbutan-2- 
oI-acetic acid-water (IO:]: 10) (51. Using the same 
solvent system with cellulose TLC plates and three 
successive developments to improve the separation, we 
resolved synthetically prepared CMglu into its two 
diastereoisomers with apparent R, values of 0.45 and 0.49. 
CMglu isolated from S. juponica migrated with the lower 
R, value. Third, we applied the electrophoretic procedure 
of Przybylska and Strong [6] in which they found that 
erythro4Mglu migrated faster toward the anode at pH 
4.4. For this purpose, we prepared 4-Mglu by limited

prepared CMglu (erythro + three isomers) was adjusted to pH 
3.0 with acetic acid and heated to 70”. At the tunes indicated, 10 pl 
samples were withdrawn, neutralixed with triethylamine, dried, 
and the compounds present subjected to pica-tag dcrivatimtion 
and analysis. The ratio is that of the integrated area of the peak at 
2.23 min {the erythro isomer) divided by that at 2.42 mitt (the 
rhreo isomer).

fastereluting isomer when subjected to pica-tag analysis 
and showed the faster electrophoretic mobility (R, value 
= 0.72475 versus 0.69471, relative to aspartic acid). 
Collectivdy. these results are consistent with CMglu from 
S. jupokca being the erythro isomer. This finding con- 
trasts with the accumulation of tkreo4hydroxy-t.- 
glutamic acid in leaves of Phlox decussuta [7,8]. 
4 -substituted gIutamic acids, in SoPhora 2479 
In these studies with S. japonica, we also examined the 
levels of 2-0~0 acids in extracts of 28day-old leaves and 
roots; this was done by high pressure liquid chromato- 
graphy fractionation and characterization of their quin- 
oxalinol derivatives. Derivatives of Z-oxoglutaric acid, 
pyruvic and/or oxalacetic acid, OMG, and an unknown 
acid (possibly 2-oxo4hydroxy4methylgiutaric acid) 
were detected in leaves and roots (Table 2). In addition, a 
small peak at the position of 2~xo4methyleneglutaric 
acid (OMeG) as well as several unidentifi~ peaks of 
similar size were observed in extracts of leaves. A sample 
of leaf extract containing the 2-0~0 acids was subjected to 
transamination by pig heart glutamate:oxalacetateamino- 
transferase (GOT); aspartate served as the amino group 
donor and the oxalacetate formed was reduced with 
NADH in the presence of malate dehydrogenase.7 Any 
oxalacetate present in the original extract was removed by 
a prior incubation with the enzyme system in the absence 
of aspartate. The amount of NADH oxidized was found 
to correspond to the amount of OMG plus the trace of 2- 
oxoglutarate known to be present in the sample; pyruvate 
was not expected to undergo transmination with GOT 
and whatever acids were present in the unknown fraction 
apparently were also not utilized as substrates in this 
system. Analysis of the products of the aminotransferase 
reaction by the pica-tag method showed that erythro-4- 
Mglu had been formed; no CMeglu was detected. Since 
only L-amino acids are utilized or made by pig heart GOT 
[9], the product formed by transamination ofOMG must 
be L-(2S,4R)CMglu. Hence,OMGin theextractsisofthe 
(4R) configuration and the naturalIy occurring cl-Mglu is 
also most likely the (2S, 4R)-isomer. 
To the best of our knowledge, the only route for 4- 
Megln biosynthesis is via amidation of CMeglu as 
catalysed by a highly specific 4-Megln synthetase [lOJ; 
trace amounts may possibly be formed by nonspecific 
action of glutamine synthetase [ 111. Where and when they 
are found in biological tissues, 4-Meglu and CMegln most 
generally occur together (as is true for peanut and honey- 
locust plants). The results reported here for S. japorrica are 
the first in our studies where CMegln is found in the 
absence of any detectable amount of CMegk. If any 4- 
Meglu is actually present, its level is extremely low 
(< 0.1 pmol/g dry wt of tissue) suggesting that either 
efficient coupling between 4-Meglu biosynthesis and 
amidation (possibly via an enzyme complex) occurs in this 
species or a different route exists in Sophora for 4-Megln 
formation. Be that as it may, the concept of 4-MegIt& 
Megln serving as a coupled nitrogen-translocating system, 
as has been suggested for peanut plants [lo, 123, would 
not seem to apply to S. joponica. What the physiological 
significance is of reasonable levels of OMG and erythro4 
Mglu in S.juponica also remains to be determined. It 
seems quite apparent, however, that interesting dif- 
ferences must exist between p&nuts and Sop~oru in the 
metabolism and/or enzymology of ~substitut~ glutamic 
acids and elucidation of such differences could yield 
7 Transamination of synth&aIly-pnpared DL-OMG showed 
a biphasic rate of NADH oxidation; after 50 % reaction, the rate 
decreased to 10% of the initial rate. The product lftcr 50% 
reaction was excIusively eryc&o4MgIu; after c.ompIction of the 
reaction, both isomers were present in equaI amounts.

EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials. Pods of Sophora japonica werecollected from plants 
growing on the campus of The University of Michigan. The seeds 
were washed, mechanically scarified, and hydrated in Hz0 for 
2-3 hr. These seeds were then pIaced on moist filter paper until 
the radicle emerged, subsequently planted in pots containing 
moist vermiculite, and finally placed in a growth chamber with a 
16 hr light period and a temperature schedule of 27” (light) and 
22” (dark). The plants were watered twice weekly with the 
nutrient solution of ref. (131 supplemented with 10 mM KNOJ 
and 1.7 mM NH,HIPO,, and with distilled Hz0 on all other 
occasions. At various times, seedlings or parts thereof were 
removed. weighed, and then extracted for 6 hr at room temp. with 
Ha0 containing 0.5% tolucne Cl43 after the suspension was 
initially heated to ca 80” for ISmin in order to inactivate 
enzymes. Leaves from mature plants were extracted in the same 
manner, whereas washed but unscarified seeds were crushed 
imm~iateIy hefore being extracted. 
Solvents for HPLC were obtained from Burdick and Jackson 
Laboratories (Muskegon, MI), reagents for derivatization and 
analysis of amino acids were from Pierce Chemical Co. 
(Rockford, IL). Cellulose TLC plates were purchased from 
Analtech, Inc. (Newark, DE) and Dowex resins were AR grade 
from BioRad Laboratories (Richmond, CA). Samples of 4-Mglu 
and CMegln, containing all stereoisomers, were synthesized in 
our laboratories and their 29x0 analogues were prepared by 
oxidative dean&&on by the procedure of Maitra and Dckker 
WI. 
Fr~ci~tion and ~~~spr~~~es, A portion oftheextracts 
was first subjected to analysis on the amino acid analyser. The pH 
of another portion, containing co 2-3 pm01 of amino acids, was 
then adjusted to 4.4 and the soln passed through a column (0.7 
x 4 cm) of Dowex- 1X8 resin (acetate phase) with 2-3 ml of H1O. 
The wash fluid containing the neutral and basic compounds was 
saved, the acidii amino acids and organic acids were elutcd from 
the resin with 1.0 N HCI. The eluate was concentrated in uacuo to 
dryness twice, theresiduedissolved in H,O, thepH of themixture 
adjusted to 2.2, and this soln then passed through a column (0.7 
x 4 cm) of Dowex-50X8 resin (H + phase) with 2-3 ml of water. 
The wash fluid was analysed for 2~x0 acids and the acidic amino 
acids were eiuted from the resin with 0.5 N NH,OH. The pH of 
2480 H. C. W~meu and E E. DEKKER 
the wash fluid containing the neutral and basic compounds was 
adjusted to 2.2 and this soln passed through a similar column of 
Dowcx-50 resin. Now the wash fluid was discarded whik the 
adsorbed amino acids were cluted with 1.0 N NH,OH. The 
eluate was concentrated to dryness in uucuo several times and the 
final residue dissolved in a small vol. of water. This fractionation 
procedure was used to avoid possibk hydrolysis of the amino 
acid amides by exposure to extremes of pH and provided 
quantitative recovery of all amino acids except arginine. Portions 
of the neutral amino acid fraction were hydrolysed in 6 N HCI at 
1 IO” for 16 hr and the acidic amino acids so released were again 
fractionated on a column of Dowex-1 resin as before. 
Amino acid analyses were carried out on a modified Beckman 
amino acid analyser as previously described [16]. Pheny- 
thiocarbamykttion and the separation of PTC-amino acids by 
HPLC were accomplished with the standard pica-tag system [4] 
except that the pH of solvent A was adjusted with HOAc to give 
the retention times indicated earlier. Waters Associates (Milford, 
MA) HPLC equipment was used for pica-tag analyses at a 
pressure of 133 kg/cm2 and UV detection. A solvent system of n- 
BuOH-propionic acid-H,0 (8:4:5) or of the composition 
specifically indicated was used for TLC on 250~ Avicel 
cellulose plates. Thin-layer ekctrophoresis was performed on the 
same type of plates in a Pharmacia FBE-U)OO apparatus at ca 
800 V and 50 W for 1.5 hr using the buffer of ref. [6]. 
Dekwni~rion oj2-0~0 acids. organic acids in the appropriate 
fraction were derivatized and analysed by a modification of the 
method of ref. [17]. Cone HCI (0.15 ml) and 0.15 ml of an o- 
phenylenediamine soln (5OmM recrystallized o-phenyl- 
enediamine in 2 N HCI containing 5 pl of 2-mercaptccthanol per 
ml of soln) were added to a 0.6 ml sample containing co 1 pmol of 
2-0~0 acids. After the reaction was allowed to occur for 20 hr at 
room temp. 0.2 ml of 30% (w/v) NH&I soln was added and the 
mixture then extracted with EtOAc (4 ml x 3). The combined 
EtOAc extracts were dried to a film with a stream of argon. For 
analysis, the dried samples were dissolved in 0.1 ml MeOH 
(HPLC grade), diluted with 0.4 ml HsO, and 10 PI aliquots of 
these solns were fractionated on an Altex Ultrasphere ODS 
HPLC column (0.46 x 25 cm) with the following solvents and 
elution system (Waters Associates HPLC equipment, 200 k@cm’ 
pressure, UV detection). Initial conditions consisted of 15% 
solvent A (0.15 M NH,OAc plus 85 % solvent B (MeCN); linear 
gradients up to 80 % solvent A + 20 % solvent B in 2 min and then 
up to 100 % solvent B in 8 min followed in turn; 100 % solvent B 
was finally maintained for 10 min. By this procedum, the elution 
times shown for 2-0~0 acids listed in Table 2 were obtained at a 
flow rate of 1.2 ml/min.
