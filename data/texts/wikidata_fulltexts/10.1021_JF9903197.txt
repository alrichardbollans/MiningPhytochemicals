Study of the Phenolic Profile of Cider Apple Cultivars at Maturityby Multivariate TechniquesJuan J. Mangas,* Roberto Rodrı́guez, Belén Suárez, Anna Picinelli, and Enrique DapenaCentro de Investigación Aplicada y Tecnologı́a Agroalimentaria, Apartado 13, E-33300 Villaviciosa,Asturias, SpainPhenolic compounds in 46 Spanish cider apple varieties were determined by RP-HPLC with directinjection. Several pattern recognition procedures, including principal component analysis (PCA),linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and partial least squares (PLS-1), were applied to the data inan attempt to classify the samples into bitter and nonbitter categories. Reliable decision rules wereobtained by both LDA and PLS-1. LDA achieved 91.3 and 85.7% correct classification respectively,for internal and external evaluation of the model.Keywords: Cider apple; polyphenols; direct injection HPLC; chemometricINTRODUCTIONVarious types of phenolic compounds are found incider apple cultivars, namely, hydroxycinnamic acidderivatives, monomeric and oligomeric flavan-3-ols,dihydrochalcones, and flavonols (Picinelli et al., 1997;Guyot et al., 1998; Escarpa and González, 1998). Theyplay an important role in browning processes and in theformation of hazes and sediments, they contribute tothe flavor of processed apple products, and from thepoint of view of health, some of them, such as hydroxy-cinnamates, are an important source of antioxidants andfree radical scavengers (Okuda, 1993; Chen and Ho,1997; Donovan et al., 1998).Many studies have dealt with the phenolic composi-tion of apples and its relation to browning susceptibility.Enzymatic browning occurs in fruits and vegetables asa result of enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compoundsinto quinones, which subsequently polymerize intobrown products (Nicolas et al., 1994). Quinones arehighly unstable and can undergo reactions with otherphenolic compounds, giving rise to dimers with ano-diphenolic structure; they can later undergo oxidationenzymatically or by coupled oxidation with o-quinones(Macheix et al., 1990a). At the same time, other non-phenolic substances such as amino or thiol groups canreact with quinones, giving rise to a new o-diphenolicstructure that, once oxidized, can form intensely coloredproducts.Polyphenol-protein interaction (based on hydrogenand/or hydrophobic bonding) is involved in haze forma-tion in fruit juices and alcoholic beverages, the amountof haze formed being related to polyphenol and proteinlevels and to their ratio (Siebert et al., 1996a). At thesame time, the percentage of proline in polypeptides hasalso been shown to be very important in haze produc-tion; in fact, polypeptides with a high content of prolineproduced more haze. The nature of polyphenols is alsoinvolved in the formation of haze. In this sense, flavan-3-ols dimers of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin werefound to be implicated in the formation of haze inalcoholic beverages and apple juice (Siebert et al.,1996b).The taste of cider is dependent on the presence offlavan-3-ol derivatives. Bitterness and astringency arerelated to the degree of polymerization of procyanidins(Lea, 1990), the most astringent being the most polym-erized procyanidins. At the same time, certain hydroxy-cinnamic acids are bitter (Macheix et al., 1990b) andmonomers of flavan-3-ols such as (+)-catechin wererated bitter and astringent (Robichaud and Noble,1990).Polyphenol analysis is generally accomplished by RP-HPLC with UV-vis detection. Due to the complexity ofthe analysis, two methods for polyphenol fractionationhave traditionally been used: liquid-liquid extraction(Salagoity-Auguste and Bertrand, 1984; Suárez et al.,1994) and solid-liquid extraction (Lee and Jaworski,1987; Suárez et al., 1996). However, analysis of majorpolyphenols of low molecular mass can be carried outby direct injection following a simple treatment of thesample (Betés-Saura et al., 1996; Suárez et al., 1998).Likewise, the optimization of analytical information canbe carried out by means of chemometric techniqueswhen a large amount of data is available. For example,exploratory data analysis can be used to search for“natural” groupings of samples and to reduce dimen-sionality. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowsreduction of the number of variables and visualizationof the data structure. Linear discriminant analysis(LDA) computes a decision rule to predict the class towhich a sample belongs. Partial least squares (PLS)regression allows prediction of the values of one or moredependent variables from a set of predictor variables(Massart et al., 1988; Martens and Naes, 1989; Melounet al., 1992). When the dependent variable is the classidentity, the procedure is called PLS discriminantanalysis.Although classification of cider apple varieties intotechnological groups has been successfully done in thepast using data for total polyphenols and total acidity(Beech and Carr, 1977), the information obtained bymeans of the analysis of global parameters can be* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed(telephone 34-85890066; fax 34-85891854; e-mail juanjoma@princast.es).4046 J.

Because a balanced phenolic profile is desirableboth to control microbiological spoilage and to guaranteeflavor quality of ciders, a study of the phenolic profileof apple varieties should be necessary.The purpose of the present work was to carry out atechnological characterization of various Spanish ciderapple varieties traditionally used in cider-making on thebasis of their phenolic profiles.MATERIALS AND METHODSSamples. Spanish cider apple cultivars, grown during the1994 (42 varieties) and 1995 (46 varieties) seasons in theexperimental orchard of the CIATA (Villaviciosa, Asturias,Spain), were harvested at maturity and directly sampled (2.0-2.5 kg of fresh apples; ∼24 fruits). Apples from each varietywere milled with a hammer mill and pressed by means of asmall hydraulic press; the apple musts obtained were subse-quently clarified by centrifugation (12000g; 5 min) and frozenat -20 °C until analysis. Ascorbic acid (10 g/L) was added tothe apple juices prior to filtration through a 0.45 µm celluloseacetate membrane filter (Teknokroma, Barcelona, Spain)before chromatographic analysis.Total polyphenols were determined according to the Mon-treau method (1972) and expressed as grams of tannic acidper liter; total acidity was done determined by using the AOACprocedure (AOAC, 1984) and calculated as grams of sulfuricacid per liter.Reagents. Standards for polyphenols [chlorogenic acid, (-)-epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, and phloridzin] were obtainedfrom Sigma, Spain. Procyanidin B2 and phloretin 2-xyloglu-coside were provided by Dr. Lea (Reading, U.K.) and used foridentification purposes only. Methanol and acetic acid wereof HPLC quality (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) and degassedwith helium prior to use.Chromatography. Experimental data were obtained usingan HPLC system (Kontron Instruments S.A., Madrid, Spain)equipped with a 465 autosampler (Vi ) 25 µL), two 422 pumps,a 440 diode array detector, and a KromaSystem 2000 softwaredata module. Analytical separation of phenolic compounds wascarried out on a Spherisorb ODS-2 column (250 mm × 4 mm,3 µm; Teknokroma, Barcelona, Spain) at 35 °C, using 2% aceticacid (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) as mobile solutions.The elution conditions were as follows: starting from 0%solvent B, one linear step of increase of solvent B in solvent Auntil 45% B in 55 min; flow rate ) 0.7 mL/min. Identificationof polyphenols was achieved by comparing their spectra andretention times and by spiking with the available compoundsunder the same conditions. Quantitation was done at 280 nmby the external standard method. For those analytes havingno standard available, standards of the same family were used;thus, procyanidin B2 was quantitated as (-)-epicatechin,phloretin 2-xyloglucoside and the unknown dihydrochalconewere determined as phloridzin, and the unknown phenolic acidderivatives (compounds referred to as PHA) were determinedas p-coumaric acid. A chromatogram of the phenolic com-pounds of low molecular mass is displayed in Figure 1.Data Processing. Data were processed by means of thePARVUS statistical package (Forina et al., 1988). We con-structed a data matrix (46 × 9) in which the rows (46)represented cider apple varieties harvested in 1995, and thecolumns (9) corresponded to phenolic compounds [an unknownphenolic acid derivative, PHA1 (λmax ) 316.7 nm), procyanidinB2, chlorogenic acid, (-)-epicatechin, an unknown phenolicacid derivative, PHA2 (λmax ) 312 nm), phloretin 2-xyloglu-coside, an unknown dihydrochalcone (λmax ) 283 nm), phlo-ridzin (phloretin glucoside), and an unknown phenolic acidderivative, PHA3 (λmax ) 312 nm)]. In addition, samples werecategorized as bitter (B) or nonbitter (N), according to theirtotal pholyphenol contents. Samples included in the bittercategory presented total phenol levels >1.5 g/L, whereas thenonbitter category were <1.5 g/L. The data were autoscaledbefore multivariate analysis. A binary variable (Y) was definedto construct the PLS model, with the following values: Y ) 1for the nonbitter class and Y ) 2 for the bitter class. The 42cider apple varieties harvested in 1994 were included in anevaluation set to evaluate the LDA analysis.RESULTSData for polyphenol compounds, total phenols, andtotal acidity are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Majorphenols were chlorogenic acid, (-)-epicatechin, andprocyanidin B2. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was, in general,the main compound among the phenols determined;only a few samples exhibited higher contents for (-)-epicatechin and procyanidin B2 (varieties referred to as12, 13, 14 and 34, both in 1995 and 1994, as seen inTables 1 and 2). Mean contents of procyanidin B2 and(-)-epicatechin were 38.37 and 44.27 mg/L, respectively.Among phenolic acid derivatives, that referred to asPHA2 was the main one, with mean contents of 10.44mg/L, ranging between 0.00 and 68.34 mg/L duringharvest of 1994.Dihydrochalcone glucosides, such as phloridzin andphloretin 2-xyloglucoside, are characteristic of apples.Phloretin 2-xyloglucoside contents were usually higherthan those for phloridzin, whereas the unknown dihy-drochalcone was absent in several varieties. The t testshowed no significant differences for phenolic compoundcontents between years at the 95% confidence level.Total phenols and total acidity are represented ashistograms in Figure 2 for the 88 observations. As seenin Figure 2a, the main group of varieties (62.5%) wasrepresented in the range from 0.8 to 1.3 g/L, whereasonly 11.4% of the samples presented total phenolcontents >1.9 g/L. Total acidity was mainly comprisedbetween 4.00 and 5.50 g/L (55.7%, Figure 2b). Theseparameters are usually employed for the classificationof apples into technological groups; however, this infor-mation can be limited, because nothing is said aboutdifferences in the quantitative phenolic profiles of applevarieties.Figure 1.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 47, No. 10, 1999 4047PCA. PCA was carried out to reduce the number ofvariables and to define the structure of the data. Threesignificant components, which accounted for 74.9% ofthe variance, were computed and validated by meansof a single-cross full-validation procedure that uses thesearch for a local minimum prediction residual errorsquare sum (PRESS) as criterion. Phloridzin, (-)-epicatechin, and the unknown dihydrochalcone wereremoved from the original data matrix because theycontributed to the same information as PHA1, procya-nidin B2, and phloretin 2-xyloglucoside, respectively.Then, a new PCA was carried out by taking into accountonly the six relevant variables. The same explainedvariance was obtained using the first three significantfactors. A biplot constructed from the first two principalcomponents is displayed in Figure 3. As can be seen inthis figure, we were able to establish two groups ofvariables: on the one hand, PHA1, B2, and PHA2 werecorrelated to the first factor, and, on the other, chloro-genic acid and phloretin 2-xyloglucoside were correlatedto the second factor. Likewise, a structure of data canbe assessed from this plot. For instance, the PardaBlanquera (12) variety was placed in the upper right-hand corner of the factorial plane, because this varietyshowed a high content of procyanidin B2, PHA1, andPHA2; however, its chlorogenic acid content was rela-tively low. In contrast, the Cristalina (28) and Perezosa(38) varieties were placed in the upper left-hand cornerof the factorial plane, which shows that these varietieshave a low content of polyphenols of low molecular mass(Table 1). The Cristalina and Perezosa varieties, to-gether with the Dolores and No Prieta Antigua varietiesTable 1.

It was also possibleto visualize other groupings of samples: varieties witha high content of chlorogenic acid (5, 16, 18, 23, and 31)scored negatively with respect to the second principalcomponent; other varieties, however, such as Loroñe,Meana, and Regona (13, 14, and 41), which showed ahigh content of PHA1 and a relatively low chlorogenicacid content, were placed in the upper right-handquadrant of the factorial plane.At the same time, it was possible to draw a borderlinein Figure 3 to differentiate the cider apple varieties withbitter and nonbitter properties. We categorized thesamples from the structure visualized in the factorialplot as follows: the bitter class (B, 15 varieties), samplesinside the borderline, and the nonbitter class (N, 31varieties), samples outside the border; 87% of samplesbelonging to the bitter category presented contents fortotal phenol >1.5 g/L, and 90% of samples belonging tothe nonbitter category presented total phenol contents<1.5 g/L (Tables 1 and 2).LDA. The use of the LDA technique allowed us tocorrectly discriminate apple varieties belonging to theB and N categories (correct classifications ) 100%). Themathematical rule computed was validated using threegroups for cancellation; the prediction matrix obtainedis shown in Table 3. As can be seen, correct predictionswere 91.3%, which allows us to assert that this clas-sification procedure is sufficiently robust. The mostrelevant variables for discriminating both categorieswere PHA1, chlorogenic acid, and phloretin 2-xyloglu-coside. At the same time, the 42 cider apple varieties(harvested in 1994) included in the evaluation set (Table2) were used in the external validation of the math-ematical procedure computed. As can be seen in Table4, the predictive ability of the LDA method was ad-equate because 85.7% of the samples included in theevaluation set were correctly predicted.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 47, No. 10, 1999 4049referred to as 12 was removed from the PLS-1 modelbecause it was a leverage point. The PLS-1 modelconstructed consisted of one latent variable, the mostrelevant variables being, in order of importance, PHA1,phloretin 2-xyloglucoside, and chlorogenic acid, whichis in accordance with the discriminant analysis. Themodel was validated by means of a cross-validationprocedure, using three groups for cancellation, andexhibited a maximum cross-validated explained vari-ance of 71.8% and a multiple linear correlation coef-ficient of 75.0% with one latent variable. Multiple boxand whisker plots for PLS computed values are repre-sented in Figure 4, showing a satisfactory differentiationof the two categories (bitter and nonbitter).DISCUSSIONThe contents of CA in our samples were higher thanthose reported by Delage et al. (1991) for some Frenchcider varieties, even for the bitter ones, such as thecultivar Kermerrien, which should be related to thesample preparation procedure, consisting of extractionof polyphenols with ethyl acetate. Contents for flavanolssuch as (-)-epicatechin and procyanidin B2 were lowerthan those reported by Lea (1990) for English varietiesbut higher than those by Delage et al. (1991).As said, total phenols and total acidity are used forclassification of apple varieties into technological groups;however, important differences for phenolic profiles canbe found. For example, the varieties named as bitterpresented differences that are important to the techno-logical point of view. As said, the most discriminantvariables were PHA1, chlorogenic acid, and phloretin2-xyloglucoside. Samples incorrectly assigned as bitterin the LDA model presented in the evaluation set highercontents for PHA1, CA, and phloretin 2-xyloglucoside;thus, they were included in the bitter category, althoughtheir total phenol levels were lower in the 1994 harvestthan in the 1995 harvest (except for the Solarinavariety). Among these phenolics, chlorogenic acid is oneof the most important substrates for polyphenol oxidase(PPO); its oxidation gives rise to pigments that can co-oxidize other substances (Amiot et al., 1992). Therefore,cider apple varieties with a low concentration of chlo-Figure 2.

For this reason, wecould say that varieties referred to as 5, 9, 16, 18, 23and 31 (Figure 3) are not suitable for apple juicemaking.Phenolic acids also contribute to cider flavor; on theone hand, they can act as precursors for volatile phenols,due to the metabolism of bacteria of the genus Lacto-bacillus and yeasts of the genera Saccharomyces andBrettanomyces (Beech and Carr, 1977; Chatonnet et al.,1992, 1993), which can produce undesirable off-flavorsif they surpass the acceptability threshold. On the otherhand, phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid can havea subtle contribution to the astringency of beverages(Naish et al., 1993).Flavan-3-ols are also substrates for PPO, althoughless so than chlorogenic acid, and can also be oxidizedby the o-quinone of chlorogenic acid by a coupledmechanism, giving rise to highly colored pigments. Infact, the degree of browning of apples was found to bedependent on the relationship hydroxycinnamic deriva-tives/flavan-3-ols (Amiot et al., 1992). These authorssuggested that both the chlorogenic acid and the relativebalance of hydroxycinnamics to flavanols should beconsidered in the susceptibility to browning. All of thevarieties analyzed presented lower (-)-epicatechin andprocyanidin B2 levels than the English ones used forcider-making (Lea, 1990). Although lower contents inflavan-3-ols should be considered an advantage in termsof the stability of cider with respect to haze, we alsohave to keep in mind both their positive contributionto the taste of cider and the ability of these polyphenolsto control microbiological spoilage. In this sense, itshould be pointed out that the use of cider applevarieties with very low contents of polyphenols (e.g., theCristalina and Perezosa varieties) could promote severalfaults caused by lactic acid bacteria such as acidification,mannitol taint, and ropiness.CONCLUSIONSThe analysis of polyphenols of low molecular mass inSpanish cider apple varieties has been successfullyaccomplished by HPLC with direct injection. In generalterms, the content of flavanols was lower than thatreported for English cider apple varieties but higherthan that described in some French cider apples. Theuse of PCA allowed us to visualize technological groupsof the varieties based on their phenolic profiles and toidentify their potential use for manufacturing processedapple products. Finally, the mathematical decision rulecomputed by LDA and the PLS-1 model constructedallowed us to carry out a suitable prediction of thecategory to which the cider apple varieties belong.Chlorogenic acid, phloretin 2-xyloglucoside, and thecompound referred to as PHA-1 were the most relevantvariables for discriminating apple varieties into bitterand nonbitter categories.LITERATURE CITEDAmiot, M.
