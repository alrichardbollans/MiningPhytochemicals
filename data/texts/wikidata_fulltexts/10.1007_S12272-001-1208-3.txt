Many species of the genus Dracaena are used inAfrican traditional medicine for the treatment of a varietyof diseases. Dracaena mannii bark’s decoction is used bythe native people of the western highlands of Cameroonagainst abdominal pains. Furthermore, the mixture of itsroots with “palm wine” is used in Cameroonian ethno-medicine for the treatment of male impotency (Noumi etal., 1998). The occurrence of steroidal saponins in severalDracaenaceae plants is well documented (Mimaki et al.,1999; Okunji et al., 1991). Steroidal saponins are a classof natural products with strong biological and pharmaco-logical effects. Some recently isolated steroidal saponinshave been shown to possess antifungal, cytotoxic andantitumor effects (Zhang et al., 2006; Sautour et al; 2004;2007) but only very few reports have been made regardingtheir anti-inflammatory effect. In our ongoing search fornew and/or potentially bioactive saponins from Camerounianmedicinal plants (Tapondjou et al., 2002; 2003; 2005;Teponno et al., 2006), the stem bark of D. mannii growingin the western highlands of Cameroon has been studied.In this study we found that the extracts of D. manniiexhibited significant in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. Inthe present paper we describe the isolation and structuralelucidation of steroidal saponins from D. mannii and theirstructure-activity relationships on the in vivo anti-inflam-matory test.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneral procedure1H-NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents(CD3OD and pyridine-d5) on a Brucker AMX-400 Spectro-meter at 400 MHz while 13C-NMR spectra were recordedin the same solvents and the same apparatus at 100MHz. All chemical shifts (d) are given in ppm units withreference to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standardand the coupling constants (J) are in Hz. ESI-MS weretaken on a LCQ Thermofiningan Apparatus. IR spectrawere measured as a film on a KBr pellet using a FTIR-8400S Shimadzu spectrometer. Column chromatography1was performed using silica gel 60 Merck (0.040-0.063 mm)and sephadex LH-20. TLC was carried out on precoatedKieselgel 60 F254 (Merck) plates which were first viewedwith an ultraviolet lamp MULTIBAND UV- 254/365 nm forfluorescent spots and thereafter developed by sprayingwith 50% H2SO4 and heating for 10 mins at 110oC. Solventswere distilled prior to use.Plants materialThe stem bark of Dracaena mannii was collected inDschang (West province of Cameroon) in March 2006and authentified by Dr G. Achoundong of the CameroonNational Herbarium, Yaoundé where specimens document-ing the collection are deposited (Ref:12485/SRF/CAM).Extraction and isolationThe dried and pulverized stem bark of Dracaena mannii(2.5 Kg) was extracted three times (each time for 24 h)with 95% EtOH. The filtrate obtained was concentratedunder reduced pressure to yield a dark residue (252 g).Part of this extract (160 g) was suspended in water (300mL) and extracted with EtOAc (26.3 g) and n-butanol(66.8 g), respectively. Part of the n-butanol extract (64.1 g)was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel,with EtOAc-MeOH-H2O (85:15:5) as eluent, yielding fourfractions (A-D). The fraction (B, 11.9 g) with steroid saponinswas further subjected to repeated silica gel column chro-matography (EtOAc-MeOH-H2O, 95:5:2) to afford com-pounds 3 (20 mg), 1 (900 mg), and 4 (9.57 g). Part of theEtOAc extract (24.4 g) was subjected to silica gel columnchromatography and elution was performed with hexane-EtOAc increasing polarity to afford five main fractions (I-V). From fraction II (Hexane-EtOAc (8:2)) (4.00 g), com-pound 2 (152 mg) was obtained after further purificationover silica gel column chromatography eluted with hexane-EtOAc (8:2) and recrystallisation in CH2Cl2.Pennogenin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-glucopyranoside (1)White amorphous powder; ESI-MS: m/z 761 [M+Na]+, IR (cm-1): 3325, 2950, 1733, 1456, 1081; 1H-NMR (400MHz, pyridine-d5):  0.55 (3H, d, J = 5.0 Hz, H-27), 0.77(3H, s, H-19), 0.82 (3H, s, H-18), 1.08 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz,H-21), 1.57 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-6''), 3.74 (1H, m, H-3),4.76 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1'), 5.15 (1H, brs, H-6), 6.10(1H, brs, H-1''; 13C-NMR (100 MHz, pyridine-d5) : Table I.maxKBrTable I. 13C-NMR data (ppm, 125 MHz) of compounds 1-4 isolated from the Dracaena mannii stem barkCarbon 1 2 3 4 Carbon 1 2 3 41 37.5 38.5 37.8 37.4 24 28.7 29.4 29.1 28.62 30.0 33.2 30.3 29.9 25 30.3 33.3 30.7 30.33 78.1 72.4 78.1 77.9 26 66.6 67.7 67.0 66.74 39.2 43.0 38.9 38.6 27 17.1 17.5 17.6 17.25 140.7 142.3 141.0 140.7 3-O-Gluc 1' 102.1 105.9 99.86 121.7 122.1 122.2 121.7 3-O-Gluc 2' 75.6 75.9 78.27 32.2 32.3 32.4 31.7 3-O-Gluc 3' 83.5 78.7 87.48 32.4 32.8 32.7 32.0 3-O-Gluc 4' 69.8 71.8 70.59 50.0 51.4 50.5 50.1 3-O-Gluc 5' 78.2 78.4 77.710 36.9 37.7 37.4 37.0 3-O-Gluc 6' 62.4 62.9 62.211 20.9 21.7 21.2 20.8 3'-O-Rha 1'' 102.8 102.512 31.9 32.5 32.1 31.9 3'-O-Rha 2'' 72.5 72.313 45.0 45.5 45.5 45.0 3'-O-Rha 3'' 72.6 72.514 53.0 53.9 53.3 52.9 3'-O-Rha 4'' 74.1 73.515 31.9 31.2 32.1 31.9 3'-O-Rha 5'' 69.6 69.816 89.9 90.6 90.3 89.9 3'-O-Rha 6'' 18.6 18.317 90.0 91.2 90.5 90.0 2'-O-Rha 1''' 103.718 17.1 17.4 17.5 17.0 2'-O-Rha 2''' 72.419 19.3 18.8 19.7 19.3 2'-O-Rha 3''' 72.720 44.7 45.8 45.1 44.7 2'-O-Rha 4''' 73.721 9.6 9.0 10.1 9.6 2'-O-Rha 5''' 69.822 109.7 110.9 110.2 109.7 2'-O-Rha 6''' 18.523 32.4 32.0 32.7 32.3Solvent C5D5N CD3OD C5D5N C5D5N Solvent C5D5N CD3OD C5D5N C5D5N2Pennogenin (2)White amorphous powder; ESI-MS: m/z 883 [2M+Na]+,413 [M-H-H2O]-; IR  (cm-1): 3531, 2871, 1728, 1456,1057; 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD):  0.80 (3H, d, J = 5.6Hz, H-27), 0.84 (3H, s, H-18), 0.89 (3H, d, J = 7.1 Hz, H-21), 1.07 (3H, s, H-19), 3.26 (1H, m, H-3), 3.86 (1H, t, J =7.8, H-16), 5.20 (1H, brs, H-6); 13C-NMR (100 MHz,CD3OD) : Table I.Pennogenin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (floribundasap-onin A) (3)White amorphous powder; ESI-MS: m/z 615 [M+Na]+; IR (cm-1): 3415, 2971, 1725, 1430, 1050; 1H-NMR (400MHz, pyridine-d5):  0.70 (3H, d, J = 5.7 Hz, H-27), 0.98(3H, s, H-18), 1.09 (3H, s, H-19), 1.26 (3H, d, J = 7.2 Hz,H-21), 1.57 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-6”), 3.85 (1H, m, H-3),4.90 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz, H-1'), 5.28 (1H, brs, H-6); 13C-NMR (100 MHz, pyridine-d5) : Table I.Pennogenin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)]-β-D-glucopyranoside(spiroconazole A) (4)White amorphous powder; ESI-MS: m/z 883 [M - H]-, 737[M - H - 146], 591 [M - H - 2  146]; IR  (cm-1): 3435,3006, 2918, 1660, 1437, 1406, 1029, 955, 706; 1H-NMR(400 MHz, pyridine-d5):  0.55 (3H, d, J = 5.5 Hz, H-27),0.82 (3H, s, H-19), 0.94 (3H, s, H-18), 1.09 (3H, d, J = 7.5Hz, H-21), 1.50 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-6''), 1.61 (3H, d, J =6.5 Hz, H-6'''), 3.74 (1H, m, H-3), 4.90 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz,H-1'), 5.18 (1H, brs, H-6), 5.77 (1H, brs, H-1'''), 5.87 (1H,brs, H-1''); 13C-NMR (100 MHz, pyridine-d5) : Table I.Acid hydrolysis of compound 1Compound 1 was hydrolysed in 5% H2SO4 under refluxfor 3 h. After neutralization with NH4OH followed by ex-traction with CHCl3, the aqueous layer was evaporated invacuo to give a crude sugar residue. The resulting residuewas analysed by TLC (silica gel, CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (64:40:8) in comparison with standard sugars. The spots ofthe product on TLC were identical to those of D-glucose(Rf 0.32) and L-rhamnose (Rf 0.51).Experimental animalsWistar rats of either sex, aged between 12 and 16 weeksand weighing about 200 g obtained from the animalhouse of the Faculty of Science, University of Dschang,were used in these studies. The animals were housed incolony cages. They were exposed to daily 12 h light-darkcycle and have free access to standard laboratory dietand water. The ethic committee of the Cameroon Ministryof Scientific Research and Technology which has adoptedthe guidelines established by the European Union onAnimal Care and Experimentation (CEE Council 86/609),approved all experimental procedures.Carrageenan-induced paw edemaThe experiment was conducted as described by Winteret al. (1962). Animals were divided in 10 groups of 6 ratseach. Groups 1 ad 2 served as negative controls andreceived vehicles (distilled water, control1 and the mixtureof 2.5% DMSO and 2.5% tween 80, control2). Groups 3and 4 (positive controls) received indomethacin (10 mg/kg) and aspirin (10 mg/kg) respectively. Groups 5 and 6were treated respectively with the ethanol and n-butanolextracts at the dose of 600 mg/kg. Groups 7–10 receivedcompounds 1 to 4 at the dose of 10 mg/kg. All thetreatments were administered orally thirty minutes prior tothe administration of 0.1 mL of carrageenan (1%, sub-plantarly). The volume of the paw was measured beforetreatments (V0) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after carra-geenan injection (Vt) with the aid of a Ugo Basil Plethys-maxKBrmaxKBrmaxKBrFig. 1.

The edema was expressed as anincrease in the volume of paw, and the percentage ofinhibition for each rat and group was obtained as follow(Lanhers et al, 1991):RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder.Its ESIMS (positive mode) showed the pseudomolecular[M+Na]+ ion peak at m/z 761 corresponding to the mole-cular formula C39H62O13. The glycoside nature of 3 wasshown by strong IR absorptions at 3325 and 1051 cm-1characteristic of hydroxyl groups and glycosidic linkagesrespectively (Dong et al., 2001). The 13C-NMR spectrumshowed 39 signals (Table I) among which 27 were assign-ed to the aglycone; the remaining 12 signals were indica-tive of the presence of two hexoses. The salient featuresof this spectrum were the presence of three signals at 140.7 (C-5), 121.7(C-6) and 109.7(C-22) characteristic of5-spirostene type sapogenin (Agrawal et al. 1985). Thestructure of the aglycone moiety was recognized to bepennogenin (3,17-dihydroxyspirost-5-ene) by 1H- and13C-NMR analysis (Table I) using connectivities observedin 1H-1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC spectra and was in fullagreement with the literature data (Mahato et al., 1981;Hufford et al., 1988). TLC of the mild acid hydrolyzed 1revealed the presence of glucose and rhamnose. Twoanomeric carbon atoms detected at  102.9 (C-1'') and102.2 (C-1') in the 13C-NMR spectrum, were shown to beattached to proton signals at  6.10 (1H, brs) and 4.76(1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz), respectively, in the HSQC experiment.The ring proton of each monosaccharide residue wasassigned starting from the readily identifiable anomericproton using 1H-1H COSY spectrum. Analysis of 2D ex-periments (1H-1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC) followed bycomparison of 1H- and 13C-NMR data of the sugar moietywith those reported in the literature (Dong et al., 2001;Hufford et al., 1988; Teponno et al., 2006) revealed thepresence of an inner glucopyranosyl residue and a terminalrhamnose (Table I). The coupling constants observed forthe two anomeric proton signals at 4.76 (1H, d, J = 7.5Hz) and 6.10 (1H, brs) suggested that the linkages of theglucose and rhamnose were of the  and  forms, respec-tively. The sequence of the sugar chains were obtained byHMBC experiment.

Statistically significant compared to negative control2.44.76 (H-1') and the carbon atom at C 78.1 (C-3) showedthat the glucopyranosyl moiety is linked at C-3 of theaglycone. The cross peak correlation observed betweenthe signal of the anomeric proton at H 6.10 (H-1'') and thecarbon atom of the glucopyranosyl moiety at C 83.5 (C-3') suggested the location of the rhamnopyranosyl unit atC-3'. The common D-configuration for glucose and L-configuration for rhamnose were assumed to be those ofthe most commonly encountered analogues in the plantkingdom. Thus, the structure of compound 1 was elucidatedas pennogenin-3-O--L-rhamnopyranosyl-(13)--D-glu-copyranoside, a new natural secondary metabolite towhich we assigned the trivial name mannioside A.Compound 2 was isolated as white amorphous powder.It was identified as pennogenin by comparison of the ESI-MS, 1H- and 13C-NMR data with those previously reportedin the literature (McAnuff et al., 2005). Compounds 3 and4 were also obtained as white amorphous powders. Theywere respectively identified as pennogenin-3-O--D-glu-copyranoside (floribundasaponin A) and pennogenin-3-O--L-rhamnopyranosyl-(12)-[-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(13)]--D-glucopyranoside (spiroconazole A) by comparison oftheir ESIMS, 1H- and 13C-NMR data with those previouslyreported in the literature (Mahato et al., 1981; Teponno etal., 2006).The sub-plantar injection of the carrageenan producedan inflammatory edema which increased gradually, re-aching its maximum at the 4th hour after injection of thephlogistic agent (Table II). All the extracts presented signi-ficant (P < 0.001) anti-inflammatory effects with maximumactivity observed within 2 h. The ethanol and the n-butanolextracts exhibited an inhibitory percentage of 74 and 65%,respectively. The tested compounds showed, one hourafter carrageenan injection, a maximum inhibitory activityof 80.57%, 71.22%, 66.19%, and 30.21% for compounds1, 3, 4 and 2, respectively. Although reduced, the signi-ficant activity was maintained during all the experimentalperiod for compounds 1, 3 and 4. The indomethacin pro-duced an anti-inflammatory activity which increased grad-ually to reach a maximum of inhibition (62.36%, P < 0.001)at the 4th hour.Additional information could be deduced from the struc-ture-activity relationship of the tested pennogenin gly-cosides. Globally all the pennogenin glycosides (1, 3 and4) were more potent than pennogenin (2). Attachment ofD-glucose to pennogenin was observed to significantlyimprove (from 30.21% to 71.22% edema reduction) theanti-inflammatory activity (compound 3). One sugar moiety(rhamnose) substitution to C-3 of D-glucose in compound1 led to a little higher activity (from 71.22% to 80.57%edema reduction) than that of compound 3 whereas, incompound 4, two rhamnose moieties attached at bothsites of C-2 and C-3 of D-glucose in compound 3 slightlyreduced the activity (from 71.22% to 66.19% edemareduction).Although further studies are needed to ascertain thebiomedical and molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of these compounds, the presentstudy has documented the anti-inflammatory properties ofDracaena mannii stem bark. Furthermore, it has beendemonstrated that pennogenin glycosides play a signifi-cant role in the overall anti-inflammatory response inducedby this plant.
