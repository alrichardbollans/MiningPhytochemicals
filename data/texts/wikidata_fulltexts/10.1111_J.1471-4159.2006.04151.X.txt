Abstract
The naturally-occurring compound, n-butylidenephthalide
(BP), which is isolated from the chloroform extract of Angelica
sinensis (AS-C), has been investigated with respect to the
treatment of angina. In this study, we have examined the anti-
tumor effects of n-butylidenephthalide on glioblastoma multi-
forme (GBM) brain tumors both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro,
GBM cells were treated with BP, and the effects of prolifer-
ation, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined. In vivo,
DBTRG-05MG, the human GBM tumor, and RG2, the rat
GBM tumor, were injected subcutaneously or intracerebrally
with BP. The effects on tumor growth were determined by
tumor volumes, magnetic resonance imaging and survival
rate. Here, we report on the potency of BP in suppressing
growth of malignant brain tumor cells without simultaneous
ﬁbroblast cytotocixity. BP up-regulated the expression of
Cyclin Kinase Inhibitor (CKI), including p21 and p27, to
decrease phosphorylation of Rb proteins, and down-regulated
the cell-cycle regulators, resulting in cell arrest at the G0/G1
phase for DBTRG-05MG and RG2 cells, respectively. The
apoptosis-associated proteins were dramatically increased
and activated by BP in DBTRG-05MG cells and RG2 cells, but
RG2 cells did not express p53 protein. In vitro results showed
that BP triggered both p53-dependent and independent path-
ways for apoptosis. In vivo, BP not only suppressed growth of
subcutaneous rat and human brain tumors but also, reduced
the volume of GBM tumors in situ, signiﬁcantly prolonging
survival rate. These in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects
indicate that BP could serve as a new anti-brain tumor drug.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the extreme expression of
anaplasia among the glial neoplasmas, accounts for 40% of
all primary intracranial tumors (Mahaley et al. 1989; Graham
and Lantos 2002). The diffusely invasive properties of GBM
mean that total resection is almost impossible and therefore,
surgery plus radiotherapy, and eventual chemotherapy, is the
standard treatment (Santarius et al. 1997; Graham and
Lantos 2002; Giese et al. 2003). Nonetheless, the clinical
course rarely exceeds 18 months from the time of diagnosis,

Graham and Lantos 2002).
Chemotherapy is usually reserved for recurrent tumors that
have already been treated with surgery and radiotherapy, or
for tumors in which surgery was only partial or infeasible and
the effect of radiotherapy was limited (Blacklock et al. 1986;
Shapiro and Green 1987). Various chemotherapy schemes
have been used, with most consisting of administering drugs
at high doses (Shapiro and Green 1987). The present
chemotherapy regimens are limited for several reasons,
including development of toxicity and drug resistance,
limited success in overcoming the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) and limited therapeutics (Blacklock et al. 1986;
Shapiro and Green 1987; Elliott et al. 1996; Bello et al.
2001; Cheng et al. 2004).
Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS; dong quai; also called
danggui), a traditional Chinese medicine for menopausal
symptoms (Ye et al., 2001a; Ye et al., 2001b; Yim et al.
2002), has been clinically administrated for several gynec-
ological symptoms in the US (Abebe 2002). In our previous
study, the chloroform extract of A. sinensis (AS-C) also
showed a dramatic anti-tumor effect, causing growth resting
and apoptosis of malignant brain tumors in vitro and in vivo,
and both p53-dependent and -independent pathways of
apoptosis were involved in the cytotoxic mechanisms (Tsai
et al. 2005). Thus far six major compounds have been
isolated form A. sinensis: (E)-liguistilide, (Z)-ligustilide, (Z)-
n-butylidenephthalide, palmitic acid, beta-sitosterol and
ferulic acid (Wang et al. 1998). n-Butylidenephthalide (BP,
BdPh or K1; molecular weight approximately 188.22)
derived from AS-C was the major component (over 30%
of AS-C crude) and was therefore chosen in this further study
to verify its anti-tumor activity.
Several medicinal properties of BP, such as the anti-
platelet effect, are due mainly to an inhibitory effect on
cyclo-oxygenase (Teng et al. 1987). It also provides relief
from angina (Ko et al. 1998, 2002). In addition, it has been
suggested that the anti-proliferation effect of synthetic BP-42
(3-butylidene-4,5-dihydroxyphthalide), which was modiﬁed
by adding the hydroxyl molecules in the phthalide group of
BP, could be used as an anti-atherosclerotic treatment
(Mimura et al. 1995). However, the anti-tumor activities of
BP have not yet been determined. In this study, the anti-
tumor effects of BP on malignant brain tumors in vitro and
in vivo were investigated. The results revealed that the
signiﬁcant therapeutic anti-tumor efﬁcacy of BP on GBM
tumors involved the induction of cell-cycle rest and apoptosis.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
n-Butylidenephthalide (BP; molecular weight: 188.23), purchased
from Lancaster Synthesis Ltd (Newgate, Morecambe, UK) and
carmustine (BCNU; Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA)
were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and ethanol, incuba-
ted with shaking at 25 C for 1 h, and stored at 4 C before each
in vitro experiment.
Cell lines and cell culture
The DBTRG-05MG line of human GBM cells, RG2 line of rat
GBM cells, SK-N-AS line of human neuroblastoma cells, SVEC
line of mouse vascular endothelial cells and Balb/3T3 line of mouse
ﬁbroblast cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). G5T/VGH human GBM cells,
GBM 8401 human GBM cells, GBM 8901 human GBM cells, A549
human lung adenocarcinoma cells, PA-1 human teratoma cells, B16/
F10 mouse melanoma cells, HL-60 human leukemia cells and N18
mouse neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the Bioresources
Collection and Research Center (BCRC, Hsin Chu, Taiwan). The J5
line of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and BCM-1 line of
human breast cancer cells were kindly provided by Drs M. J. Chou
and C. S. Yang (Sherr and Robert 1995) and Dr D. S. Yu (Reed
et al. 1994; Dobashi et al. 2003), respectively. The DBTRG-05MG,
GBM8401, GBM8901, BCM-1, HL-60, A549, PA-1 and J5 cells
were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) medium with 10% fetal
bovine serum, at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. The G5T/VGH, RG2, SK-N-AS, N18, B16/F10, SVEC and
Balb/3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Cytotoxicity analysis
Viable cells were evaluated by a modiﬁed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Brieﬂy,
5 · 10
3 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate,
incubated overnight with 100 lL growth medium in 96-well
plates, then treated with 100 lL BP dissolved in the medium
(0–250 lg/mL). The concentration of DMSO was £ 0.02% in
each preparation. After 24, 48 or 72 h of BP treatment, the
medium was replaced with 50 lL fresh medium containing MTT
(400 lg/mL) for 6–8 h. The MTT medium was then removed and
100 lL DMSO added to each well. The solutions were detected
using an MRX Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynax Technolo-
gies, Chantilly, VA, USA) at 550 nm. Absorbance of untreated
cells was considered as 100%. The 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was the concentration that caused a 50% decrease in the
optical density of drug-treated cells with respect to untreated
cells.
Analysis of cell-cycle distribution
The GBM tumor cell lines DBTRG-05MG and RG2 were cultured
with drug diluent for 48 h; DMSO content was controlled
at £ 0.02% and BP at 75 lg/mL. Cell-cycle analysis was
performed by DNA staining with propidium iodide (PI) and ﬂow
cytometry. Brieﬂy, cells were harvested, resuspended in 0.8 mL
1 · phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added to 200 lLP I
solution (50 lg/mL PI + 0.05 mg/mL RNase A; Sigma Chemical
Co.). After overnight incubation at 4 C, cells were kept at 25 C
for 2 h. The cells were then passed through FACScan (Becton
Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) to
measure the DNA content.

  2006 The AuthorsDetermination of apoptosis
Apoptosis was assayed using an in Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
POD (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, DBTRG-05MG and RG2 cells were
cultured in culture dishes and analyzed at the indicated time points
(24, 48, 72 h) after BP (75 lg/mL) treatment. In the BP-treated
cell group, suspended cells were collected; in the control group,
adherent cells were collected. Cells were ﬁxed at 25 C for 15 min
with 3.7% formaldehyde, smeared on silane-coated glass slides
(Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), washed once in 1 · PBS
and incubated in cold permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton
X-100 + 0.1% sodium citrate) after reducing endogenous peroxi-
dase enzyme activity with 3% H2O2. Then, cells were incubated
with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 C,
and counterstained with PI for determination of the cell count. To
quantify cell apoptosis, the slides were viewed under ﬂuorescence
microscopy (Nikon, Kawasaki, Japan).
Western blot analysis
DBTRG-05MG and RG2 cells were seeded in a six-well plate and
later treated with BP (75 lg/mL) for different times (0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12,
24 or 48 h; 0 h as a vehicle control). Cell pellets were resuspended
in lysis buffer [10 nM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EGTA, 0.5%
3-[3-(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate,10%
(v/v) glycerol, 5 mM b-2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM phenyl-
methylsulfonyl ﬂuoride] and incubated on ice for 30 min. After
centrifugation at 13 000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 C, total cell lysates
were collected. The protein concentration of the cell lysates was
measured with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Aliquots (20 lg) of the cell lysates were separated by 10–12%
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–
PAGE; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to polyvinyl-
idenediﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Lifesciences,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5%
skim milk for 1 h at 25 C, then incubated with the respective
antibodies. The antibodies included anti-Fas, anti-Fas-L, anti-
caspase 3, anti-caspase 8, anti-caspase 9, anti-Bax, anti-AIF, anti-
p16, anti-p21, anti-p27, anti-p53, anti-cdk2, anti-cdk4, anti-cdk6,
anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin E, anti-actin (1/200 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA); anti-phospho-p53
(Ser15; 1/2000 dilution), and anti-phospho-RB (Ser795; 1/2000
dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA).The
immobilized primary antigen-antibody complex was detected with
the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-
rabbit or anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (1/1000 dilution; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 25 C, then visualized with an
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus chemiluminescence sys-
tem (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). The degree of protein
expression was calculated as the expression index. The expression
indexes were calculated as [(sample intensity/sample b-actin inten-
sity)/(vehicle control intensity/vehicle control b-actin intensity)].
Animal studies
To examine the anti-tumor effects of BP in vivo, RG2 rat GBM cells
were used in male F344 rat (230–260 g) experiments, and DBTRG-
05MG human GBM cells were used in male Foxn1 nu/nu mouse
(10–12 weeks) experiments. The rats and mice were purchased from
the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All
procedures were performed in compliance with the standard
operating procedures of the Laboratory Animal Center of Tzu Chi
University (Hualien, Taiwan).
In vitro cultured RG2 cells (1 · 10
6) were injected s.c. into the
back of syngeneic F344 rats. Six animals in each vehicle or BP
group were treated on days 3, 6 and 9 after tumor cell implantation
by s.c. injection of BP (500 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (10 mg/mL
Tween-80 and 50 mg/mL propylene glycol in distilled water;
Standard Chem. & Pharm., Tainan, Taiwan), far from the inoculated
tumor cell sites (> 1.5 cm). In addition, DBTRG-05MG cells
(2.5 · 10
6) were injected s.c. into the backs of nude mice (ﬁve to
six/group), and treated with vehicle, BP)70, )150, )300, )500
and )800 mg/kg/day (s.c.) respectively. The injection site was far
from the inoculated tumor sites (>1.5 cm away from treated site),
on days 4 , 5, 6, 7 and 8 after tumor cell implantation. Tumor size
was measured with calipers and the volume was calculated as
L · H · W · 0.5236 (Bardon et al. 2002). Animals were killed
when the tumor volume exceeded 25 cm
3 in rats and 1500 mm
3 in
mice; the day on which an animal was killed was designated as the
ﬁnal survival day for the rats and mice.
The anti-tumor effects of BP on in situ tumors were determined
with RG2 cells. The RG2 cells were injected i.c. into the striatum of
syngenic rats (six/group) and treated with BP (300 mg/kg/day) or
vehicle s.c. on days 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 after tumor cell implantation.
Tumor volume was measured using 3-T unit magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI; General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) with
echo-planar imaging capability (Fukuoka et al. 2000) (Signa LX 3.8;
General Electric) in Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital (Hualien,
Taiwan). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/mL, 1 mL/100 g). Functional MRI scanning was conduc-
ted with a fast spin echo and an echo-planar acquisition sequence in
which the repetition time was 6000 ms, the echo time 102 ms, the
matrix image 256 · 256 pixels, the ﬁeld of view 5 · 5 cm and the
in-plane resolution, 80 lm. Twenty slices, each 1.5 mm thick, were
obtained every 19.5 s for a total time of 6.5 min/rat.
Immunohistochemical staining
All tumor tissues (s.c. or i.c. GBM tumors with or without BP
treatments) were harvested and ﬁxed. Parafﬁn-embedded sections
(7 lm/section) were obtained from the tumors and processed for
immunohistochemical staining. A goat polyclonal anti-Ki-67 anti-
body (M-19; 1/100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and a
rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175) antibody (1/1000
dilution; Cell Signaling Technology.) were used in immunohisto-
chemical studies with 4 C overnight incubation. The immune
complexes were visualized using the horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gatedanti-goatIgGsecondaryantibodies(1/1000dilution;SantaCruz
Biotechnology Inc.) and LSAB2 system (DAKO, Corp., Carpinteria,
CA, USA), respectively, and then incubated for 10 min with 0.5 mg/
mLdiaminobenzidineand0.03%(v/v)H2O2inPBS.Finally,sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, observed under a
light microscope at magniﬁcations of 400·, and photographed.

Results
Cytotoxic effects of BP on tumor and other cell lines
The anti-proliferative effects of BP on cells from GBM,
neuroblastoma, lung cancer, melanoma, teratoma, leukemia,
breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as from
normal ﬁbroblast and vascular endothelial cells, were
determined. The IC50 values of BP after a 48 h incubation
with tumor cell lines (IC50: 15–67 lg/mL) were signiﬁcantly
lower than the values for normal ﬁbroblast cells (IC50:
>100 lg/mL, p < 0.0001) or carmustine (BCNU)-treated
tumor cells (IC50:4 0  100 lg/mL, p < 0.001; Table 1). In
the two normal cell types, vascular endothelial cells (IC50 ¼
25.0 ± 2.0 lg/mL) were more sensitive to BP than ﬁbroblast
cells (IC50 > 100 lg/mL) (p<0.0001). Brieﬂy, these
experiments showed that BP could induce high cytotoxicity
against brain and other tumor cells but only low, or no
cytotoxicity against normal ﬁbroblast cells.
The morphology of GBM tumor cells gradually changed
with detachment from the bottom of the culture plates, after
BP treatment (data not shown). The TUNEL assay was used
to verify the viability of detached cells and the results
showed that the cells were in the process of apoptosis at 48 h
(Figs 1a and b). Therefore, BP has a cytotoxic ability against
tumor cells.
The effects of BP on cell cycle of GBM cells
Cell-cycle analysis with GBM cells demonstrated that 75 lg/
mL BP treatment resulted in cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1
phase (> 90% and > 70%; Figs 1c and d). BP induced a
signiﬁcant proportion of cells to arrest at the G0/G1 phase,
accompanied by a concurrent decrease of S phase from 12 to
24 h (p<0.05). In addition, BP also led to a decrease in the
proportion of the DBTRG-05MG cells that entered the G2/M
phase, though more cells accumulated at G2/M phase in RG2
cells. The results at 48 and 72 h were similar to those at 24 h
(data not shown).
Apoptotic pathways in GBM cells induced by BP
To investigate apoptotic pathways induced by BP treatment,
phosphorylation of p53 and Rb proteins were ﬁrst evaluated
by immunoblotting. The DBTRG-05MG and DBTRG 8401
line of human GBM cells, and RG2 line of rat GBM cells,
were used for comparison. BP caused levels of phosphoryl-
ated p53 protein to increase (9.4-fold) 3 h after treatment
(Fig. 2a). Furthermore, total p53 protein increased (twofold)
at 12 h in DBTRG-05MG and DBTRG 8401 (twofold)
increased at 3 h. In RG2 cells, the genes of p53 and p16 are
impaired and exhibit homologous deletion, and these were
undetectable in immunoblotting analysis. However, levels of
phosphorylated Rb proteins were decreased after BP treat-
ment in DBTRG-05MG and DBTRG 8401 cells; in RG2
cells, the levels were decreased (0.8-fold) at 1.5 h, with
phosphorylated proteins undetectable as early as 3 h after BP
treatment (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that BP can trigger

  2006 The Authorscell-cycle checkpoint machinery. Levels of p16, p21, Bax
and AIF protein in BP-treated GBM cells were therefore
measured, and protein expression levels of all four proteins
increased in DBTRG-05MG and DBTRG 8401 cells; similar
results for p27, Bax and AIF were detected in RG2 cells after
treatment with BP (Figs 2b and c). The protein expression of
cdk2, cdk4, cdk6, cyclin D1 and cyclin E in BP-treated GBM
cells was also measured, and all ﬁve proteins were decreased
in DBTRG-05MG and DBTRG 8401 cells; similar results for
cdk2, cdk4, cdk6, cyclin D1, cyclin E and p21 were detected
in RG2 cells after treatment with BP (Fig. 2b).
Expression of the proteins Fas and Fas-L in treated
DBTRG-05MG, DBTRG 8401 and RG2 cells was studied.
Results showed that BP signiﬁcantly induced Fas expression
(from one to 41.3-fold vs. one to 7.7-fold in DBTRG-05MG
and RG2 cells, respectively) but not Fas-L expression. In
addition, activation of death receptor-induced apoptosis-
related caspase 8 protein was monitored. Levels of caspase 8
in DBTRG-05MG and DBTRG 8401 were increased in a
dose-dependent manner from 6 to 48 h after BP treatment,
whereas the maximum expression of caspase 8 in RG2 cells
at 24 h (Fig. 2d).
Finally, activation of pro-caspase 9 and procaspase 3 was
also determined (Figs 2c and d). Both procaspase 9 and
procaspase 3 were highly activated in DBTRG-05MG,
DBTRG 8401 and RG2 cells after BP treatment.
Anti-tumor effects of BP on survival of animals bearing
subcutaneous GBM tumor
To investigate BP anti-tumor activity, in vivo animal
experiments were carried out. There was a signiﬁcantly
higher inhibitory effect on RG2 tumor growth in the
BP-treated group than in the control (vehicle only) group
(Fig. 3a; p < 0.005). The average tumor size at day 26 was
20.7 ± 1.5 cm
3 for the control group, in contrast to a size
of only 9.6 ± 0.4 cm
3 for the BP-treated group. Survival of
rats in the BP treatment group was signiﬁcantly prolonged
compared with survival in the control group (30 ± 2.1 days
vs. 41.5 ± 4.2 days; Fig. 3b; p < 0.0001). There were no
signiﬁcant differences between the control and BP-treated
groups with respect to the body weight of the rats after BP
treatment (Fig. 3c). There were remarkable decreases in
Ki-67 (a cell proliferation marker) protein expression in
this study, which indicated that BP had anti-proliferation
activity in vivo. Cleaved caspase 3 is an apoptotic marker,
and the results showed that BP treatment increased the
cleavage of caspase 3 protein to induce apoptosis of tumor
cells in vivo (Fig. 3d). Both the inhibition of tumor cell
growth and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis pathways
were mediated by BP treatment in vitro and in vivo. With
s.c. injection of BP at a dose of 500 mg/kg, no drug-
related toxicity was observed based on the histological
analysis of organs in animals treated with BP (data not
shown).
Anti-tumor effects of BP on in situ GBM tumor of rats
To verify the BP anti-tumor effects on the in situ GBM
tumors in rats, F344 rats were implanted i.c. (striatum) with
5 · 10
4 RG2 cells and treated with s.c. BP (300 mg/kg/day)
on days 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. MRI data revealed that the in situ
tumor volumes in the BP-treated group were smaller than
those in the control group (Fig. 4a). There were signiﬁcant
declines in tumor volume for the treated group relative to the
untreated group (Fig. 4b; p < 0.05). The mean tumor
volumes at days 14 and 16 were 70.0 ± 4.8 mm
3 and
126.4 ± 11.1 mm
3 for the control group vs. 46.6 ± 1.8 mm
3
and 91.7 ± 8.3 mm
3 for the BP-treated group. The immu-
nohistochemistry results on day 16 after BP treatment
showed a decrease in Ki-67 protein expression, an increase
in cleaved caspase 3 protein expression and an increase in
apoptosis in tumor cells relative to the control group in vivo
(Fig. 4c); these results are similar to those shown in the
subcutaneous RG2 tumor model. Survival was signiﬁcantly
prolonged for the BP-treated rats compared with rats of the
control group. At day 19 after BP treatment, BP caused
higher survival rates (50%, 3/6) than the untreated group
(16.7%, 1/6) (p ¼ 0.0016; data not shown).
Anti-tumor effects of BP on xenograft tumor growth
To determine whether BP can suppress human GBM tumor
growth, nude mice were inoculated with human DBTRG-
05MG cells and treated with BP (70, 150, 300, 500 and
800 mg/kg in the BP-70, BP-50, BP-300, BP-500 and BP-
800 groups, respectively.) on days 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Signiﬁcant
suppression of tumor growth with respect to the untreated
group was observed in the BP-70-, BP-150-, BP-300-, BP-
500- and BP-800-treated groups. At day 200, the tumor
growth rates were 100% (6/6), 80% (4/5), 80% (4/5), 50% (3/
6), 33.3% (2/6) and 16.7% (1/6) in the untreated, BP-70, BP-
150-, BP-300-, BP-500- and BP-800-treated groups, respect-
ively (p<0.05). The mean tumor sizes at day 89 were
>1000 mm
3 in the control group, 605.8 ± 98.8 mm
3 in the
BP-70-treated group, 504.4 ± 38.9 mm
3 in the BP-150-
treated group, 415 ± 130 mm
3 in the BP-300-treated group,
365.8 ± 116.7 mm
3 in the BP-500-treated group and
171.6 mm
3 in the BP-800-treated group (Fig. 5a; p < 0.05).
Survival was signiﬁcantly prolonged for nude mice in the BP-
treated with respect to the control group (Fig. 5b; p < 0.001).
At day 200, survival rates were 0% (0/6), 20% (1/5), 40% (2/
5), 50% (3/6), 66.7% (4/6) and 83.3% (5/6) in the untreated,
BP-70-, BP-150-, BP-300-, BP-500- and BP-800-treated
groups, respectively. After tumor inoculation, tumor masses
(average volume ¼ 41.84 ± 4.45 mm
3) were developed on
the backs of every mouse, but the tumors of mice with BP
treatment shrank or completely regressed to be undetectable
on day 150. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the
control and BP-treated groups with respect to the body weight
of the animals (Fig. 5c). Evenwith a high BP dose of 800 mg/
kg for 5 days of serial treatment, very low or no drug-related

histological analyses of various organs (data not shown). The
human GBM tumor tissues with BP treatment in vivo also
displayed decreases in Ki-67 expression, and increases in

Discussion
n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) contributes to a range of biolo-
gical activities, including diminution of angina, platelet
aggregation, proliferation, non-speciﬁc spasmosis (Ko 1980;
Teng et al. 1987; Mimura et al. 1995; Ko et al. 1998; 2002).
In this study, we demonstrated that BP also acts strongly

  2006 The Authors
Journal Compilation   2006 International Society for Neurochemistry, J. Neurochem. (2006) 99, 1251–1262against GBM tumors in vitro and in vivo. This anti-tumor
effect is encouraging, as very few drugs currently show
efﬁcacy against malignant brain tumors.
To explore what mechanism might account for the effects
of BP on GBM tumor cells, the cell cycles were monitored.
Our results are entirely consistent with an inhibition of tumor
growth by BP due to cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and
the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1). The pattern of increased
and decreased protein expression during cell-cycle arrest is
best explained by the BP-mediated regulation of gene

  2006 The Authorsexpression involving the cyclin/CDK/CKI cell cycle regula-
tory system (Figs 2a and b). The p53 molecule is a negative
regulator of cell division. In response to DNA damage,
oncogenic activation of other proteins and other stresses, p53
levels rise and prevent cells from entering the S phase of the
cell cycle (Reed et al. 1994; Sherr and Robert 1995). The p16
and p21 proteins are cdk inhibitors that negatively regulate
cdk or cyclin/cdk complexes (Sherr et al. 1995). The p16
protein, a member of the INK4 family, binds to cdk4 or cdk6
to block the kinase activities at the mid-G1 phase (Reed et al.
1994). The p21 protein binds to the cyclin/cdk complex,
resulting in the inhibition of the G1 to S phase transition
(Dobashi et al. 2003) via the abrogation of Rb phosphory-
lation by the cyclin/cdk complex. Therefore, the decrease in
phosphorylated Rb should be due to a BP-triggered expres-
sion of the cdk inhibitors, which decreases the activities of the
cyclin/cdk complex. A precedent for this mechanism exists
with monoterpene, an essential oil of plants (like BP) that is a
natural anti-cancer compound, which causes G1 arrest and
leads to an increase in p21 expression (Bardon et al. 2002).
Another example is aragusterol A. This compound, isolated
from marine sponges, is a potent anti-cancer marine steroid
that causes G1 arrest by down-regulation of Rb phosphory-
lation (Fukuoka et al. 2000).
The immunoblotting results inferred the possible mecha-
nisms of apoptosis induced by BP in GBM tumor cells. First,
the p53-dependent apoptosis pathway was supposed because
BP treatment could promote the phosphorylation of p53 in
the DBTRG tumor cells and increase p53 expression, which
peaked at 12 h (Fig. 2a). Phosphorylation at the N-terminal
region of p53 abolishes Mdm2 inhibition, which causes an
increase in Bax transcription (Fig. 2c shows that Bax
proteins were increased) and an inhibition of Bcl-2 tran-
scription. Because of Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, Bax can form an
active homodimer to trigger cleavage of procaspase 9
(Fig. 2c shows that caspase 9 was increased) and sequen-
tially results in procaspase 3 activation (Fig. 2d also shows
that caspase 3 was increased) to proceed apoptosis processes.
Second, the Fas–FasL-induced apoptosis pathway may also
be involved in BP-induced apoptosis. After BP treatment,
increasing expression of Fas was observed (Fig. 2d). Fas is
the death receptor responsible for signaling from the cell
membrane, which triggers the activation of procaspase 8
(Fig. 2d shows that caspase 8 was increased) and subse-
quently, promotes procaspase 3 activation resulting in
apoptosis. In order to examine these parameter cause related,
different pharmcological blockers had been approach.
Brieﬂy, we pre-treated DBTRG cells with the Fas/FasL
antagonist, 341291 (Calbiochem), or the Bax-inhibiting
peptide, 196810 (Calbiochem), then treated the cells with
BP to determine the effects of these inhibitors. We found that
neither Fas/Fas L nor Bax-inhibiting peptide could reverse
BP-induced growth inhibition. However, BP-induced growth
inhibition effect might be attenuated by the MGMT (O
6-
methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) tranfection assay
(data not shown). MGMT is a recognized DNA repair gene
(Tano et al. 1997). These results suggest that BP might be an
alkylating agent. It could directly injure tumor DNA and
cause tumor cell arrest at the G0/G1 phase in order to repair
the damage. Our study using blocking agents indicated that
Fas/Fas L and Bax were not cause tumor apoptosis
molecules. The upper regulation of Fas and Bax protein
was an association phenomenon.
RG2 cells have impaired p53 expression and homozygous
deletions at the p16/Cdkn2a/Ink4a gene locus. Therefore,
BP-induced apoptosis should be caused via a p53-indepedent
pathway (Fas-induced apoptosis pathway) but not a
p53-depedent pathway. However, although RG2 cells were
impaired for p53 and p16, p27 and procaspase 9 expression
induced by BP were increased in these cells. Thus, certain
mechanisms of p53-independent activation of procaspase
9 and p27 induction may be involved in BP-induced cell
apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. The molecular proﬁle
shown in Fig. (2) between DBTRG8401 and DBTRG-05 is
much similar to RG2. The RG2 cells had no p53 protein
expression. It might be the possibility of different proﬁle of
caspase-9 and p27 activation between DBTRG and RG2
cells.
Transdermally-applied BP quickly permeates the periph-
eral circulation system without accumulating in the skin; it is
then distributed into the lung, liver, bile, brain and kidney.
Total radioactivity, however, is decreased due to its excretion
into the urine. In the case of intravenous administration, 80%
of the administered BP is excreted into the urine within 24 h,
while only 5% is excreted into the feces. The metabolite in
urine is a cysteine conjugate (Sekiya et al. 2000). In our
experiment, DBTRG-05MG cells (2.5 · 10
6) were injected
s.c. into the backs of nude mice (ﬁve to six/group) and
treated with BP on days 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 after tumor cell
implantation. Survival of nude mice was signiﬁcantly
prolonged in the BP-treated groups, relative to the control
group (Fig. 5b; p < 0.001). On day 200, the survival rate in
the BP-800 mg/kg-treated group was 83.3% (5/6). Because
BP is excreted into the urine within 24 h, it is interesting to
note that ﬁve continuous doses showed signiﬁcant tumor
inhibition.
In conclusion, BP has potent anti-cancer effects on cell-
cycle arrest and apoptosis. The present results provide new
hope for chemotherapy of malignant brain cancer. This may
lead to new therapeutic options in the treatment of malignant
brain cancer, and an improved understanding of the interac-
tions between phytochemicals with the genes that are critical
to the regulation of brain cancer cells.
