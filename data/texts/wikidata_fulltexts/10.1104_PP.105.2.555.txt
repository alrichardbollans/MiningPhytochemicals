However, the preparation of intact symbiosomes from different legumes (Herrada et al., 1989; Udvardi and D ~ ~ ,  1989; Rosendahl et 1992) has provided interesting infomation conceming the selectivity of the PBM and has lead to a reappraisal of the tyPe of substrates available to the bacteroid' Thusf the absence Of carriers for glutamate (Udvardi et 1988; Herrada et 1989) Or Pro (Udvardi et al.f 1990) on the PBM stronglY lifits the possibilitY that these mokcules are SOurceS of energy for bacteroids. In the same way, the abundance of certain carbohydrates in the nodule cytosol does not necessarily imply that it is utilized by the bacteroid. This situation occurs for &ate and ben- zoate, which is found in soybean (Glycine max L.) (Streeter, 1991), but these molecules are unable to cross the PBM (Herrada et al., 1989). In this paper we report the presence of high concentrations Of oxalate in broad bean (Vicia fabQ L.1 nodules and examine the ability of oxalate to CrOSS the PBM and the bacteroid membranes. In addition, we studied the capacity for oxalate to support C2H2 reduction and respiration in symbiosomes and free bacteroids in the presence of leghemoglobin. We report the presence of oxalate in the organic acid fraction of broad bean (Vicia faba 1.) nodule cytosol. Using both high- performance liquid chromatography and enzymic assays, high lev- els of oxalate were detected (70.4 f 2.4 mM). To study the potential role of oxalate as an energy-yielding substrate for nitrogenase activity, free bacteroids were isolated from nodules and found to oxidize oxalate in support of C2Hz reduction under O2 tensions that were lower than those required to oxidize succinate, another dicarboxylate commonly detected in legume nodules. Symbiosomes of broad bean, isolated for the first time from amide-producing nodules, were provided with ['4C]oxalate and found to have uptake kinetics with a lower affinity [K,(oxalate) = 330 p ~ ]  than that for free bacteroids [K,,,(oxalate) = 130 PM]. In anaerobic preparations of symbiosomes supplied with purified oxyleghemoglobin, 0 2  con- sumption was stimulated by oxalate from 20.2 f 0.8 nmol 0, min-' remained lower than the rate of 0, consumption in free bacteroids (32.2 f 1.4 nmol O, min-' mg-l protein).

These data support the suggestion that oxalate may play a role as a carbon substrate in support of N, fixation in broad bean nodules. mg-' protein to 24.5 f nnlol O2 min-' mg-' protein but always 1987) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) nodules (Fougère et al., The Rhizobium-legume symbiosis is characteked by nu- merous and complex interactions between the two partners. Besides the exchange of signals during the recognition (Long, 1989; Dénarié et al., 1992) and the differentiation of nodules (Truchet et al., 1991), the microsymbionts receive reduced C and, in retum, provide the host cell with ammonia. The infected cells contain large numbers of bacteroids that express nitrogenase, and a piasmalemma-type membrane that sepa- rates the bacteroids from the host cytosol. This PBM defines the bacteroid-containing compartment known as a 'symbio- some" (Roth et al., 1988). Studies of N2 fixation at the cellular leve1 in nodules have involved, until now, isolation of bacteroids and the provision of succinate or malate as the energy-yielding substrates (Ber- gersen and Tumer, 1975b). Besides the essential role played by organic acids to support N2 fixation (Day and Copeland, 1991; Streeter, 1991), studies have explored the ability of other molecules such as Glc (Trinchant et al., 1981; Trinchant MATERIALS AND METHODS ,,iant Culture Broad beans (Vicia faba L. var minor cv Soravi) were grown in a glasshouse in a sand:vermiculite mixture (3:1, v/v) under the conditions reported elsewhere (Guérin et al., 1990). Seed- lings were inoculated 5 and 7 d after planting with a mixture of three strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv uiciae (FH 25, FH 34, and FH 20S1), kindly provided by N. Amarger (Insti- tut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Dijon, France). Nodules appeared on the roots about 1 week after inocula- tion, and during the growth of the plants they received a nitrogen-free nutrient medium (Rigaud and Puppo, 1975) adjusted to pH 7.5. Nodules were harvested when they were 5 to 6 weeks old.

Vol. 105, 1994 Preparation of Bacteroids and Symbiosomes About 20 g (fresh weight) of freshly harvested root nodules were anaerobically crushed with a pestle and mortar in a glove box filled with Ar as previously described (Trinchant and Rigaud, 1987). After washing in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.3 M Suc and 2 m~ MgSO,, bacter- oids were resuspended in phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4) to give a final concentration of about 8.8 mg protein mL-' (40 mg dry weight mL-I). For symbiosome preparations, about 30 g (fresh weight) of nodules were homogenized in a glass mortar at 4OC in 100 mL of Mes-Tris buffer (25 mM, pH 7.2) containing 2.5% (w/v) Fico11 400, 5% (w/v) Dextran T40, 5 IIIM MgS04, 2.5 m~ EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and adjusted to 450 mosmol L-' with mannitol (Herrada et al., 1992). The ho- mogenate was filtered through a 200-pm nylon mesh. A first centrifugation (40g, 10 min) at 4OC eliminated cell debris, and after a second centrifugation (500g, 10 min) most of the symbiosomes were sedimented. The pellet was gently resus- pended in Mes-Tris buffer (25 IIIM, pH 7.2) containing only mannitol and MgSO, (mannitol buffer). This fraction was layered over a Percoll step gradient containing, from the bottom to the top, 3 mL of 80% Percoll (v/v), 3 mL of 60% Percoll, and 3 mL of 30% Perco11 in a solution of Mes-Tris buffer (25 mM, pH 7.2) containing 6.5% (w/v) mannitol, 5 m~ MgSO,, and 5 mM DTT (Day et al., 1989). After centrif- ugation in a swing-out rotor at 4000g for 30 min at 4OC, the symbiosome fraction was located at the interface between the 30 and 60% Percoll and a small pellet of naked bacteroids at the bottom of the tube. The symbiosome fraction was collected, diluted in mannitol buffer, and pelleted at 500g (3 min, 4OC) to exclude Percoll. Symbiosomes were then resus- pended in the same buffer and maintained for 30 min at 25OC before use. The corresponding bacteroids were obtained by vigorously vortexing symbiosome suspensions for 5 min to rupture PBMs. The degree of purity of symbiosome prep- arations was regularly monitored by EM, and mitochondrial contamination was checked on the basis of NADH oxidase activity (Day et al., 1986) and microscopic examinations. Symbiosomes and corresponding bacteroids were prepared aerobically for metabolite transport studies and anaerobically for nitrogenase assays. In this latter case, nodules were crushed in a glove box filled with Ar, and a11 the centrifuga- tions were carried out in screw-capped tubes filled with Ar. Percoll solutions were degassed under vacuum and saturated with Ar. EM Immediately after preparation, symbiosomes were fixed in 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and postfixed with 1% (w/v) oso4 in 0.3 M Na-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). Samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (25-100%, v/v) and washed twice with propylene oxide before infiltration under vacuum in a graded Epon's resin. Ultrathin sections were stained in 7% (w/v) uranyl acetate in methanol and in 3.52% (w/v) lead citrate and observed on an electron micro- scope (CM12, Philips, Cambridge, UK). N itrogeriase Assa ys Nitrog,enase activity was detennined by C2H! reduction using a gas chromatograph (Pye-Unicam 4500, Philips) ' equippetl with a column of Porapak T (80-100 mesh) as previously described (Rigaud, 1976). The reacticln mixtures (1 mL) containing bacteroids (2.2 mg of protem) and an energy-yielding substrate (5 mM) in phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4) were placed in rubber-capped vials (7.2 rriL), thereby leaving a gas phase in the headspace of the vials. The gas phase contained 5% (v/v) C2H2 and O2 at different partia1 pressures in Ar. Experiments without a gas phase were done in glass tcuvettes (10-mm light path) closed with serum stop- pers and flushed with Ar (Bergersen and Tumer, 1975a). The cuvettes were completely filled with reaction solution (3.5 mL) containing 80 ~ L M  oxyleghemoglobin and an energy- yielding substrate (5 IIIM) in mannitol buffer equilibrated with 20% (v/v) C2H2. Reaction was started by injectirtg bacteroid or symbiosome suspensions (0.4 mg of protein) into the cuvettes. At time intervals during O2 consumpticln (10 min), the total reaction mixtures were slowly withdravrn from the cuvettes and degassed under vacuum as previous ly described (Trinchant et al., 1981). The amount of ethyiene in the evolved gas was detennined by GC. Leghemoglobin Leghemoglobin was purified from the red jupematant obtained by centrifugation of nodule homogenates according to Puppo and Rigaud (1975). The purification consisted of (NH4)*S04 precipitations (55-80%) and elution tluough a G- 100 Sephadex column (80 x 2.5 cm). After reduction by Na2S20.,, the purified leghemoglobin was oxygenated by elution through a G-15 Sephadex column (25 X 2.5 cm). Oxyleghemoglobin was concentrated to 400 to ti00 PM over an Amicon UM 10 membrane (Wittenberg et al.,. 1974), and samples (1 mL) were stored in liquid N2 until use (Bergersen and Turner, 1979). Leghemoglobin concentratiori was deter- mined by the pyridine hemochromogen assays (Bergersen et al., 1973). Measurlement of O2 Consumption In incubations without gas phase, bacteroid 2nd symbio- some O2 consumption was assayed, during C2H2 reduction, by following spectrophotometrically the deoxygenation of oxyleghemoglobin at 576 nm (the a peak of the hemoprotein) and 5612 nm (the trough between the a and (3 peaks) as proposed by Bergersen and Tumer (1975a) and 'Trinchant et al. (198'1). The calculation of free dissolved O2 concentrations from the oxygenation state of leghemoglobin and the con- stants used were as reported by Bergersen and Tumer (1979). Transport Studies Bacteroids or symbiosomes were incubated at 25OC under aerobic conditions in mannitol buffer containing increasing concentrations of Na-oxalate or Na-succinate eririched with [U-'4C]oxalic acid (1.65 GBq mmol-') or [U-'4C]:;uccini~ acid (5.55 GBq mmol-') purchased from Commissariat i l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France).

Filters were then rinsed with 5 mL of the corre- sponding assay mixture minus labeled substrate and counted in 4 mL of Aqualuma Plus (Lumac, Olen, Belgium) in a liquid scintillation counter (model LS 6000 SC, Beckman Instru- ments, Gagny, France). Determination of Oxalate Concentration in Nodule Cytosol Using ion-exchange chromatography, crude extracts of nodule cytosol were resolved in three fractions containing organic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates (Streeter, 1987). Organic acids were analyzed as phenacyl ester deriv- atives using an HPLC system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) equipped with a 3.9 X 150 mm Novapack Cls column eluted by a mobile-phase system consisting of solvent A (35% [v/v] methanol) and solvent B (100% methanol). The polarity of the elution mixture was modified by a linear or exponential increase of the percentage of solvent A in solvent B in the range of 5 to 100%. The retention time of about 10 organic acids was defined from standard solutions or from a standard mixture (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Elution was run at 25OC at a flow rate of 1 mL min-’ and detection was realized at 245 nm with a 490E UV-visible detector (Waters). Concentration of oxalate was also determined enzymically using an oxalate oxidase assay. The hydrogen peroxide pro- duced reacted with 3-methyl-2-benzothiozolidone hydra- zone in the presence of peroxidase, yielding an indamime dye absorbing at 590 nm (Sigma diagnostic kit 591C). Protein Estimation The protein content of bacteroids and symbiosomes was determined after solubilizing in 0.01% (w/v) Triton X-100 according to Bearden (1978) with BSA as a standard. tained about 85% water, and if the oxalate concentration was uniformly distributed, an oxalate concentration of 70.4 -+ 2.4 m~ would result. C2Hz Reduction by lsolated Bacteroids Anaerobic preparations of bacteroids were incubated in the presence of increasing O2 tensions in the gas phase. Endog- enous reserves supported only a low rate of C2H2 reduction, which was strongly enhanced by addition of 5 mM oxalate (Fig. 2). Oxalate-supported C2H2 reduction was optimal at 4 kPa p 0 2  whatever its concentration in the range 0.5 to 5 m. The same leve1 of activity (28.5 f 2.5 nmol C2H4 min-’ mg-’ protein) was reached when Glc or succinate replaced oxalate as the energy-yielding substrate. However, the O2 require- ment for the optimal activity supported by succinate was twice as high (8 kPa). In contrast, oxalate and Glc efficiency was restricted to a narrow range of low p02. In experiments conducted under the same conditions with bacteroids isolated from nodules of French bean or soybean cultivated as previously described (Trinchant et al., 1981), oxalate was unable to stimulate C2H2 reduction activity (data not shown). Uptake of Oxalate by lsolated Symbiosomes and the Corresponding Free Bacteroids On Perco11 gradients, broad bean symbiosomes were con- centrated in a single band located at the 30 to 60% interface. As shown on the micrograph (Fig. 3), the symbiosomes contained a single bacteroid, a general feature reported in indeteminate nodules (Bergersen, 1982). In contrast, groups of two or more bacteroids were enclosed in symbiosomes of determinate nodules such as soybean or French bean. This heterogeneity in the number of bacteroids within a symbio- some could explain the observation that symbiosomes of RESULTS Occurrence of Oxalate in Broad Bean Nodule Cytosol The elution profile of the organic acid fraction obtained from the cytosolic fraction of 6-week-old broad bean nodules always exhibited a large peak with a retention time of 8 to 15 min, with the actual retention time determined by the elution gradient used. In a11 cases, these retention times corresponded to standard oxalic acid chromatographed alone or in a mixture of organic acids. The gradient providing the best separation of oxalate from other organic acids detected in broad bean nodules was obtained using 9 to 70% of solvent B in solvent A (Fig. 1). Oxalate was present in very high quantities (59.8 f 2.1 pmol g-’ fresh weight) in comparison with other organic acids commonly present in broad bean or in other legume nodules, such as soybean (Streeter, 1987) or alfalfa (Fougère et al., 1991). Using an enzymic assay specific for oxalate (see “Materials and Methods”), we confirmed the presence of oxalate in the organic acid fraction of broad bean nodule cytosol. The quantities determined by this method were very similar (61.6 k 3.8 pmol g-’ fresh weight) to those measured by the HPLC technique.

Each experiment was in triplicate.soybean or French bean are resolved into two bands onPercoll gradients (Day et al., 1989; Herrada et al., 1992). Itshould also be noted in Figure 3 that the bacteroids were Y--shaped, a characteristic of bacteroids from nodules inducedby Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae and previously ob-served in Pisum (Bisseling et al., 1977). Another interestingfeature concerning broad bean bacteroids was their generallack of PHB whatever the age of nodules. Observations ofseveral sections from different blocks of symbiosome prepa-rations revealed a very slight (less than 2%) contaminationby free bacteroids (Fig. 3). The preparations also appeared tobe free of mitochondria on the basis of NADH oxidase activity(Day et al., 1986) and microscopic examination (data notshown).Uptake experiments in purified symbiosome preparationsand in free bacteroids obtained by vortexing symbiosomepreparations were conducted using increasing concentrationsof labeled oxalate. Typical saturation curves were found forboth symbiosomes and bacteroids (Fig. 4). The affinity foroxalate was 2.5 times higher in bacteroids than in symbio-somes having the same value of Vmax (Table I). When succi-nate was used as the substrate, the Km for symbiosomes was2.8 rimes that for bacteroids (Table I). However, the Vmaxvalue for succinate transport was 7.4 and 4 times higher thanfor oxalate transport in the bacteroids and symbiosomes,respectively.C2H2 Reduction by Symbiosomes in the Presence ofOxyleghemoglobinThe changes in absorption spectra that occurred during thedeoxygenation of leghemoglobin by symbiosomes or freebacteroids in assays performed without a gas phase wererecorded at 576 and 562 nm. Free dissolved O2 concentration,calculated from these deoxygenation experiments, rapidlydeclined with time in both bacteroid and symbiosome incu-bations (Fig. 5). However, this phenomenon was alwaysfaster for free bacteroids than for symbiosomes, regardless ofwhether the substrates were supplied endogenously (Fig. 5A)or exogenously (Fig. 5, B and C). From these values of freeO2 concentration in the incubations, O2 consumption bybacteroids and symbiosomes was determined (Table II).

C2Hz reduction activity was determined during O2 deple- tion in incubations without a gas phase, after degassing the total incubation mixture. When the experiments started, free O2 concentration was about 10 PM, and no nitrogenase activ- ity was detected (Fig. 5 ) .  In both bacteroids and symbiosomes, this activity progressively increased as the free O2 concentra- tion declined. The addition of oxalate or succinate increased the rate of O2 depletion and shortened the lag before the start of CZH4 generation (Fig. 5,  B and C). After 6 min, the free bacteroids exhibited higher C2H2 reduction activities than symbiosomes (Table 11). Oxalate enhanced nitrogenase activ- ity by bacteroids and symbiosomes 1.4-fold, whereas succi- nate increased the endogenous activity by about 3 times (Table 11). DlSCUSSlON High concentrations of oxalate (70.4 f 2.4 m) were de- tected by both HPLC and enzymic assays in the organic acid fraction of 6-week-old broad bean nodules. This concentra- tion corresponds to about 80% of the organic acid content of these NZ fixing, amide-producing nodules. In other amide- producing nodules (e.g. alfalfa, Fougère et al., 1991) or ureide-producing nodules (e.g. soybean, Streeter, 1987), cit- rate, malate, and malonate were the most commonly reported organic acids, representing more than 85% of the organic acid pool. Succinate was always detected, but at low levels, and there was no report of oxalate in nodules in these studies. The possibility that oxalate may support Nt fixation by isolated bacteroids was demonstrated in incubations with a gas phase (Fig. 2). In bacteroids supplied with oxalate, the maximum nitrogenase activity (28.5 +_ 2.5 nmol CzH4 min-' mg-' protein) was similar to that obtained with succinate, but required a lower O2 tension (4 instead of 8 kPa). Oxalate appeared as a nove1 and specific substrate in broad bean, since it was unable to stimulate C2HZ reduction in soybean and French bean bacteroids, whatever the O2 tension. A direct explanation for this failure has been reported in uptake experiments that showed that although ['4C]oxalate was taken up into symbiosomes of soybean and French bean, it was not taken up by free bacteroids (Herrada, 1992). Increas- ing concentrations of oxalate, in the range of 0.5 to 5 m, have also been assayed in our study without affecting bac- teroid C2H2 reduction activity. A recent report by Bergersen  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 2, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.560 Trinchant et al. Plant Physiol. Vol. 105, 1994 and Tumer (1993) indicated that an excess of succinate or malate inhibited nitrogenase activity in soybean bacteroids in flow chamber experiments. The authors explained the result as the involvement of NADP malic enzyme or NAD malic enzyme of bacteroids in response to the effects of malate concentration on C flow into endogenous reserves of PHB. This situation may occur in soybean nodules, where the concentration of this polymer can reach 70% of the bacteroid dry mass (Bergersen and Turner, 1990). Under our experi- mental conditions, nitrogenase was not inhibited by high concentrations of oxalate or succinate, and this fact could be related to the lack of PHB in broad bean bacteroids, as shown in Figure 3. The absence of this endogenous reserve may account for the poor C2H2 reduction activities that were observed in incubations lacking an exogenous substrate (Fig. 2). The capacity of broad bean bacteroids to oxidize oxalate has been examined in relation to the existence of a PBM whose selective role has been emphasized (Price et al., 1987; Herrada et al., 1989). The isolation of symbiosomes exhibiting a functional nitrogenase in amide-producing nodules was realized in this study. Uptake experiments with these prepa- rations showed that the PBM was able to take up oxalate rapidly, supporting the possibility that this dicarboxylate may play a role in vivo as an energy-yielding substrate for NZ fixation. The kinetic parameters for bacteroids and symbio- somes strongly suggested the existence of distinct oxalate transport activities on the two membranes. Furthermore, the camers exhibiting similar values of V,,, (Table I) ensure the rapid transport of oxalate from the plant cytosol into the bacteroids, thereby avoiding oxalate accumulation in the peribacteroid space. The availability of O2 for bacteroid respiration has often been considered as a major limiting factor for nitrogen fixa- tion (Hunt and Layzell, 1993). In using oxyleghemoglobin to mimic the natural conditions and to provide O2 to the bac- teroids, accurate measurements of free O2 concentrations during C2H2 reduction were realized (Table 11; Fig. 5). In the absence of exogenous substrates, O2 consumption in symbio- somes was 25% lower than that occumng in free bacteroids. The presence of oxalate in the incubation did not modify this percentage. This difference in O2 consumption in favor of free bacteroids was attributed to the presence of the PBM surrounding the single bacteroid inside the symbiosome. The potential role of oxalate to support N2 fixation has been demonstrated in symbiosome preparations having a specific activity of 9.7 k 0.7 nmol CzH2 min-' mg-' protein, a value that was 67% of that reported with free bacteroids (Table 11). Under our conditions, the rate of C2H2 reduction activity increased as the free O2 concentration declined (Fig. 58). This progressive activity could be due to the occurrence of an optimal ratio between nonlimiting concentrations of dicarboxylates and 02, a situation recently well defined by Bergersen and Tumer (1993), who used a flow chamber that allowed the detennination of a K, value of about 20 nM for O2 in bacteroid preparations of soybean.
