Os óleos essenciais de folhas de Poiretia latifolia Vogel nativas e cultivadas (amostras A e B, 
respectivamente) e de flores nativas (amostra C), foram obtidos por hidrodestilação e analisados 
por CG, CG/EM, e através de cromatografia gasosa em fase quiral (CGFQ). Vinte e quatro 
componentes foram identificados, representando 99,25, 99,26 e 99,23% dos óleos, respectivamente. 
Os maiores constituintes dos óleos foram os monoterpenos (S)-(-)-limoneno (16,05, 27,60, 15,60%, 
respectivamente), (1R, 4R)-trans-(+)-diidrocarvona (18,05, 0,66, 77,80%, respectivamente) e 
(R)-(-)-carvona (61,05, 64,20, 4,50%, respectivamente).   Os óleos essenciais apresentaram uma 
atividade antimicrobiana moderada quando avaliados frente a bactérias e Gram-positivas, Gram-
negativas  e fungos.
The essential oils of Poiretia latifolia Vogel, native and cultivated leaves (Samples A and B, 
respectively) and native flowers (sample C), were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed 
by GC, GC/MS and chiral phase gas chromatography (CPGC). Twenty-four compounds were 
identified, representing 99.25, 99.26 and 99.23% of the oils, respectively. The major constituents 
of the oils were the monoterpenes (S)-(-)-limonene (16.05, 27.60, 15.60%, respectively), (1R, 
4R)-trans-(+)-dihydrocarvone (18.05, 0.66 and 77.80%, respectively) and (R)-(-)-carvone (61.05, 
64.20 and 4.50%, respectively). The essential oils were evaluated against some strains of Gram 
(+) and Gram (-) bacteria, and yeast, but displayed only modest antimicrobial activity.

Introduction
Poiretia, a genus of the Papilionoidae-Leguminosae 
family, is found throughout the equatorial and subtropical 
regions of the Americas. In Brazil, it comprises about 
12 species found in the Southwestern region.1 Poiretia 
latifolia Vogel, locally called “erva-de-touro”, is native to 
South America (Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and 
Argentina). In Brazil, Poiretia latifolia is generally used 
in popular medicine for the treatment of hemorrhoids, 
renal diseases, dysentery, and as an aphrodisiac.2 As a 
continuation of our research on the essential oils of aromatic 
plants from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, we now report 
on the chemical constituents of the essential oils obtained 
from leaves and flowers of native and cultivated P. latifolia. 
The identification of the chemical constituents was based 
on comparison of their relative retention times and mass 
spectra with those obtained from authentic samples and/
or the Wiley/Nist libraries and those published by Adams.3 
The stereochemistry of the main chiral compounds present 
in the oils (limonene, carvone and dihydrocarvone) was 
determined by chiral phase gas chromatography (CPGC), 
and by chemical reactions.
The oxygenated monoterpenes carvone and 
dihydrocarvone are potential inhibitors of bacterial,4-6 
fungal growth,7 as well as prospective insect repellents.8 The 
most important technical application of carvone is its use 
as a reversible suppressant of sprouting in stored potatoes 
or flower bulbs.5 Carvone and dihydrocarvone have shown 
insecticidal activities against the rice weevil Sitophilus 
oryzae (L), one of the most widespread insect pests of 
stored cereals.9 Carvone is present in the S-(+)-enantiomer 
Porto et al. 783Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010
in oils from caraway seeds (Carum carvi; 50-70% presence) 
and from dill seeds (Anethum graveolens; 40-60%), though 
it is not always pure.10-12 (R)-(-)-carvone is the principal 
constituent in spearmint oil (Mentha spicata) and some 
oils, such as gingergrass oil, contain racemic carvone.13 
(S)-(+)-carvone is usually obtained from caraway seeds, 
while (R)-(-)-carvone is obtained from spearmint oil. 
Biosynthetically, (R)-(-)-carvone is formed by 
cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to (-)-limonene, 
hydroxylation to (-)-trans-carveol and dehydrogenation to 
(-)-carvone.14 According Croteau et al.15 this transformation 
requires four enzymatic steps, including geranyl diphosphate 
synthase (prenyltransfer), limonene synthase (cyclization), 
cytochrome P450 limonene hydroxylase (oxygenation) and 
carveol dehydrogenase (redox transformation). On the other 
hand, (1R, 4R)-trans-(+)-dihydrocarvone might be derived 
from (R)-(-)-carvone, in which the C=C bond is reduced 
enantioselectively to dihydrocarvone.16 
Experimental
Plant material
 
Native Poiretia latifolia was collected in the town of São 
Pedro do Sul, RS, Brazil (29º 37’ 14” S, 54º 10’ 44’’ W). 
Cultivated P. latifolia was obtained from the botanical 
garden of the University of Santa Maria, RS, Brazil (29° 
42’ 39” S, 53° 41’ 32” W). Leaves and flowers of native and 
cultivated P. latifolia were collected in the flowering stage 
(November-December 2005) from the same population, 
respectively, and identified by a single author (T. C. D.). 
Voucher specimens (SMDB 952-954) have been deposited 
at the Herbarium of the Federal University of Santa Maria.
Chemical analysis
  
Fresh native (sample A, 100 g) and cultivated (sample B, 
100 g) leaves from nine and seven individuals, respectively, 
and fresh native flowers from four individuals (sample C, 
10 g) from P. latifolia were subjected to hydrodistillation 
for 4 h using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus, and 
followed by extraction with diethyl ether. After solvent 
removal, crude oil yields were 0.60%, 0.55% and 0.10% 
(m/m) for samples A {d20: 0.89 g mL-1; h20 = 1.4701; [a]
D
25
 = -32.4 (c 0.08, CHCl3)}, B {d20: 0.91 g mL-1; h20 = 1.5502; 
[a]D25 = -30.2 (c 0.10, CHCl3)} and C {d20: 0.85g. mL-1; 
h20 = 1.4821), respectively. Part of the resulting oil 
(Sample A, 100 mg) was further subjected to column 
chromatography on silica gel (10 g, 230-400 mesh), eluting 
with hexane and increasing concentrations of diethyl 
ether (100%, 98:2, 95:5, 90:10 and 80:20). Ten fractions 
of about 50 mL each were obtained. Fractions 2 and 3 
(100% n-hexane) afforded limonene (15 mg). Fraction 
5 (98:2) afforded dihydrocarvone (12 mg), and fractions 
6 and 7 (95:5) afforded carvone (35 mg). The identity of 
the isolated was established by co-injection (GC) with 
standards available in our laboratories. 
The oils were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. GC analyses 
were performed using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph 
with a data handling system, FID detector and SE-54 
fused-silica column (25 m x 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 
0.25 mm). Operation conditions were as follow: injector 
and detector temperatures, 220 and 280 oC, respectively; 
carrier gas, H2; oven temperature program from 50 oC to 
250 oC at 4 oC min-1. GC-MS analyses were performed using 
a VARIAN model 3800 Saturn system operating in the EI 
mode at 70 eV equipped with CP-SIL cross-linked capillary 
columns (25 m x 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 mm). The 
identity of the oil components was established from their 
GC retention times and comparison of their MS spectra with 
those reported in the literature,3 and by computer matching 
with the Wiley 5 mass spectra library, and as well as by 
co-injection with standards available in our laboratories 
whenever possible.
Chiral monoterpene constituents (a-pinene, limonene, 
trans-dyhidrocarvone and carvone) of P. latifolia oils were 
identified by peak enrichment by enantioselective capillary 
GC with two fused capillary columns, 25 m × 0.25 mm, coated 
with the new phase heptakis (3-O-pentafluoropropionyl-
2,6-di-O-pentyl)-b-cyclodextrin17 and octakis(3-O-butiryl-
2,6-di-O-pentyl)-g-CD (Lipodex- E),18 each diluted with 
polysiloxane OV-1701. Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph 
was used for the analyses; all runs were performed with the 
temperature program 35 °C for 15 min, and from 35 oC to 
180 oC at 3 oC min-1.
   
Dihydrocarvones
Dihydrocarvones were prepared from (R)-(-)-carvone 
and (S)-(+)-carvone as described previously,19-20 as a 1:4.5 
mixture (65-80 %) of C-1 epimers (cis-1,4 and trans-1,4, 
respectively). 
  
Antimicrobial bioassay
The MICs of samples A and B and limonene, carvone, 
and trans-dihydrocarvone, were determined on 96-well culture 
plates by a micro dilution method using a microorganism 
suspension at a density of 105 CFU mL-1 with Casein Soy 
Broth incubated for 24 h at 37 oC for bacteria, and Sabouraud 
Broth incubated for 72 h at 25 oC for yeasts. The cultures 
that did not present growth were used to inoculate plates of 
(R)-(-)-Carvone and (1R, 4R)-trans-(+)-Dihydrocarvone from Poiretia latifolia Vogel J. Braz. Chem. Soc.784
solid medium (Muller Hinton Agar and Sabouraud Agar) in 
order to determine the minimal lethal concentration (MLC). 
A collection of eleven microorganisms were used, including 
three Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 
6538p), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), 
Bacillus subtillis (ATCC 6633); four Gram-negative bacteria: 
Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 10031), Escherichia coli 
(ATCC 25792), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) 
and Salmonella setubal (ATCC 19796), and four yeasts: 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC 2601), Candida albicans 
(ATCC 10231), Candida dubliniensis (Isolated clinical SM-
26) and Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 28952). Standard 
strains of microorganisms were obtained from American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and standard antibiotics, 
chloramphenicol and nystatin, were used in order to control 
the sensitivity of the microbial test.21 Proper blanks were 
assayed simultaneously and samples were tested in triplicate. 
Technical data have been described previously.22-24
Results and Discussion
As shown in Table 1, the qualitative and quantitative 
composition of samples A, B and C, displayed significant 
differences. More than 20 components were detected in 
the essential oils, making up 99.25, 99.26, and 99.23% 
of the total oil of samples A, B and C, respectively. 
Monoterpenes (ca. 99%), mainly limonene, carvone, and 
trans-dihydrocarvone, were predominant in the essential 
oils of all the leaves and flowers studied. In leaves of 
cultivated P. latifolia (sample B), trans-dihydrocarvone 
was found in lower abundance (0.66%), while in flowers 
of native P. latifolia (sample C), trans-dihydrocarvone 
was the main component (77.80%) and there was a lower 
abundance of carvone (4.50%). These monoterpenes 
are very important to the flavor and fragrance industry. 
Because the biological activity, smell and organoleptic 
properties of these compounds are determined by their 
stereochemistry,25 in this study the absolute configuration 
of a-pinene, limonene and carvone was determined by 
enantioselective capillary gas chromatography using 
heptakis (3-O-pentafluoropropionyl-2,6-di-O-pentyl)-b-
cyclodextrin17 as the chiral stationary phase (Figure S1). 
The absolute configuration of dihydrocarvone was 
determined by enantioselective chemical transformation 
of carvone to dihydrocarvone. For this purpose, (S)-(+) 
and (R)-(-)-carvones were submitted to reduction 
with Zn in methanol-water19,20 to afford a mixture of 
diastereoisomers of cis- and trans-dihydrocarvones in a 
1:4.5 ratio, respectively (Figure 1), by GC experiment. 
The four stereoisomers of dihydrocarvone were used as 
CPGC standards. By comparison of the chromatograms 
of the standards with the chromatograms of the oils and 
by co-injection, it was possible to assign unambiguously 
the absolute configuration of dihydrocarvone as (1R, 
4R)-trans. To conduct this study, octakis(3-O-butiryl-2,6-
di-O-pentyl)-g-CD (Lipodex- E)18 was used as the chiral 
stationary phase. (Figure S2). All monoterpenes analyzed 
were present in the oils as only one isomer (ee > 99%). 
Thus, the absolute configuration of the monoterpenes was 
determined as (S)-(-)-a-pinene, (S)-(-)-limonene, (R)-(-)-
carvone, and (1R, 4R)-trans-(+)-dihydrocarvone. 
The antimicrobial activity of the oils and of the 
isolated (R)-(-)-carvone and (1R, 4R)-trans-(+)-
dihydrocarvone, was evaluated by determining the 
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The results, 
between 1.25-10.0 mg mL-1), showed that the oils of 
samples A and B, (R)-(-)-carvone and (1R, 4R)-trans-
(+)-dihydrocarvone have only a modest antimicrobial 
activity against the tested microorganisms compared 
to chloramphenicol for bacteria and nystatin for yeasts 
(Table 2). Because of the small amounts of sample C 
available, we were unable to obtain information about 
their antimicrobial activity.
