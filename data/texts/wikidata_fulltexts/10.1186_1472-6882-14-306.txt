mediated by total alkaloid extract from
Corydalis yanhusuo
Jingjing Yan1, Xin He1,2*, Shan Feng1, Yiran Zhai1, Yetao Ma1, Sheng Liang1 and Chunhuan Jin1Abstract
Background: Yanhusuo (Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang; YHS), is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal medicine,
has been used in China for treating pain including chest pain, epigastric pain, and dysmenorrhea. Its alkaloid
ingredients including tetrahydropalmatine are reported to inhibit cytochromes P450 (CYPs) activity in vitro. The
present study is aimed to assess the potential of total alkaloid extract (TAE) from YHS to effect the activity and
mRNA levels of five cytochromes P450 (CYPs) in rat.
Methods: Rats were administered TAE from YHS (0, 6, 30, and 150 mg/kg, daily) for 14 days, alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels in serum were assayed, and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the liver were prepared for light
microscopy. The effects of TAE on five CYPs activity and mRNA levels were quantitated by cocktail probe drugs
using a rapid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively.
Results: In general, serum ALT levels showed no significant changes, and the histopathology appeared largely
normal compared with that in the control rats. At 30 and 150 mg/kg TAE dosages, an increase in liver CYP2E1 and
CYP3A1 enzyme activity were observed. Moreover, the mRNA levels of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 in the rat liver, lung, and
intestine were significantly up-regulated with TAE from 6 and 30 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with
TAE (150 mg/kg) enhanced the activities and the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2C11 in rats. However, the activity
or mRNA level of CYP2D1 remained unchanged.
Conclusions: These results suggest that TAE-induced CYPs activity in the rat liver results from the elevated mRNA
levels of CYPs. Co-administration of prescriptions containing YHS should consider a potential herb (drug)–drug
interaction mediated by the induction of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 enzymes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/306The effects of YHS on drug-metabolizing enzymes
such as cytochromes P450 (CYPs), which are important
in controlling xenobiotic metabolism, have occasionally
been reported. CYPs is a group of hemoproteins that are
important for oxidative metabolism (phase I) of clinically
used drugs and other xenobiotics [11]. Co-administration
of drugs that are metabolized by CYPs as well as those
that induce or inhibit CYPs can cause drug–drug interac-
tions, and these interactions may lead to severe effects
[12]. A few alkaloid constituents of YHS have been re-
ported to induce or inhibit CYPs. For example, tetrahydro-
palmatine (THP) inhibited recombinant human CYP2D6
(IC50 = 3.04 μM± 0.26 μM) and recombinant human
CYP3A4 (IC50 = 41.5 μM±3.8 μM) activities [13]; THP en-
antiomers were metabolized mainly by CYP3A4/5 and
CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes (HLMs), and l-THP
significantly inhibited CYP2D6 activity [14]; protopine and
allocryptopin induce CYP1A1 expression but have no in-
fluence on its enzyme activity in HepG2 cells [15].
However, information about whether total alkaloid ex-
tract (TAE) from YHS influences CYPs in vivo, especially
after repeated administration, is limited. In the present
study, a range of dosages of TAE from YHS (0, 6, 30, and
150 mg/kg) were orally administered to male Sprague–
Dawley rats. The effects of TAE on the expression of
five drug-processing genes including CYP1A2, CYP2C11,
CYP2D1, CYP2E1, and CYP3A1 were investigated. More-
over, CYPs activities and hepatotoxicity were characterized.

Pluswater purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA,
USA). All other regents were of analytical grade.Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (age, 5-7 weeks; weight, 210-
230 g) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal
Science and Technology of Tianjin Shanchuanhong Co.,
Ltd (Tianjin, China, Certificate No. SCXK-2013-0004).
All rats were kept under a standard 12-h dark/light cycle
with water and food provided ad libitum. All procedures
involving animals were conducted in conformity with
the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments
(ARRIVE) guidelines, and were approved by the Academy
of Military Medical Science Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (Certificate No. SCXK620076004).
Sample preparation and analysis
The dried and pulverized tubers of yanhusuo (2 Kg) were
refluxed with 70% alcohol for three times. The pooled
extract was concentrated under vacuum drying at 50°C.
The dry powder was then dissolved in 200 mL water.
The extracted solution was purified using 732 strong
acid cation exchange resin, and the following elution
program was used: six times water, and six times 70%
ethanol:water containing 5% ammonia. A solution of
70% ethanol:water containing 5% ammonia was ob-
tained, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure. Preliminary analysis of the extracts was per-
formed using an Agilent 1200 series high perform-
ance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument (Agilent
Technologies, USA). Chromatographic separation was
performed using an Agilent Zorbax HC-C18 (4.6 mm ×
250 mm × 5 μm) column (Agilent, USA). The mobile
phase were (A) 0.5% phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and
(B) methanol and the elution system was as follows:
0 - 25 min, from 85% A to 70% A; 25 - 75 min, from 70%
A to 65% A; 75 -103 min, from 65% A to 25% A; 103 -
105 min, from 25% A to 20% A; 105 - 115 min, from 20%
A to 85% A;115 - 125 min, 85% A. The flow rate was
1.0 mL/min, and the UV wavelength was 280 nm. The
major alkaloids in YHS extract were quantified, and
HPLC (Figure 1) showed that the contents (w/w) of pro-
topine, allocryptopin, dehydrocorydaline, tetrahydropal-
matine, corydaline, tetrahydroberberine, and glaucine
were 2.52%, 1.67%, 0.34%, 3.58%, 3.0%, 0.22%, and 0.66%,
respectively. Figure 2 presents the structures of the alkal-
oid components. The total alkaloid content (>45% in the
extract) was determined by UV spectroscopy.
Experimental procedure
Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (total 50 rats,
n = 10): three TAE-treated groups, the control group,
and the positive control group, respectively. In 14 con-
secutive days, TAE-treated groups were given TAE orally
at doses of 6, 30, 150 mg/kg once daily, the positive con-
trol group was intraperitoneal injection with phenobar-
bital (80 mg/kg) once daily [16], whereas the control

methylcellulose solution (5 mL/kg) once daily. After two
weeks, the rats were quickly anaesthetized with urethane
(140 mg/kg, 20% w/v solution in 0.9% NaCl) and then
sacrificed by exsanguination of aorta abdominalis. The
blood samples were centrifuged at 10000 g for 5 min at
4°C. Serum was collected immediately after each spin
and stored at -80°C until the time of assay. Livers, kid-
neys, lungs and intestines were removed immediatelyand rinsed with physiological saline. Liver was cut into
small pieces to get the liver tissue. Renal cortex was re-
moved and minced in slices to get the kidneys tissue.
Lung was cut into samll pieces to get the lung tissue. To
get the intestinal mucosa, pieces of intestine were placed
on an ice-cold glass plate, and the intestinal mucosa
gently squeezed out. All the tissues were stored at -80°C
for further analysis (the TAE dosage of 30 mg/kg was
calculated to equivalent to the clinical dosage).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/306Histopathology and blood biochemistry
Following the 14-day treatment, livers were removed
from the rats, fixed in 10% neural buffered formalin for
48 h, processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at
4 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
histological evaluation. Incidence of hepatic lesions was
determined by histologically examining the same liver
section from each animal [12]. Serum alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) levels were determined using a com-
mercial kit, GPT-UV test Nanjing jiancheng (Nanjing
jiancheng Bioengineering Institute). The potential hep-
atotoxicity to animals treated with different TAE dosages
was determined.
Microsomal CYPs activity detection
Microsomes were isolated from the rats livers (approxi-
mately 2 g) as described [17]. A rapid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was ap-
plied for determination of the activity of five CYPs in the
rat liver [18]. The HPLC system consisted of an LC-
20 AD pump, a DGU-20 A3 degasser, an SIL-20 AC
autosampler and a CTO-20A column oven (Shimadzu,
Japan). The separation was performed on an Agilent
ZORBAX XDB-C18 column (50 mm× 2.1 mm× 3.5 μm,
Agilent). The flow rate was 0.45 mL/min and consisted
of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and methonal with
0.1% formic acid (B) using a gradient elution (0.0 -
0.5 min, 98% A; 0.5 - 1.0 min, from 98% A to 2% A; 1.0 -
2.5 min, 2% A; 2.5 - 2.51 min, from 2% A to 98% A;
2.51 - 4.0 min, 98% A) were used for analysis. An API
4000 Qtrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with electrospray ion
(ESI) source was used for mass analysis and detection.
Following optimization of the setting parameters, the
ESI source was operated in both poitive mode for (PAR,
DEXP, OHMDZ, OHTOL, and carbamazepine) andnegative mode for (OHCHL) with the curtain, nebulizer
and turbo-gas (all nitrogen) set at 15, 60 and 55 psi, re-
spectively. The source temperature was 550°C and the ion
spray needle voltage was 5000 V in poitive mode and
-4200 V in negative mode. PHE (CYP1A2), TOL
(CYP2C11), DEXM (CYP2D1), CHL (CYP2E1), and MDZ
(CYP3A1) were selected as the CYPs isoform probe sub-
strates for the current study. The multiple reaction moni-
toring (MRM) mode was chosen for quantification of the
metabolites of the probe substrates (Table 1). The recovery
(extraction efficiency) of PAR, OHTOL, DEXP, OHCHL,
and OHMDZ from HLMs were determined at three differ-
ent concentrations of quality control samples ( they were
0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 μM). The internal standard was carba-
mazepine (75 ng/ml). The extraction recoveries of PAR,
OHTOL, DEXP, OHCHL and OHMDZ were 86.3 ± 2.0%,
92.1 ± 1.6%, 87.2 ± 1.3%, 93.3 ± 2.0%, and 90.8 ± 1.9%,
respectively.
Incubation mixtures (200 μL) containing 0.1 M potas-
sium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.25 mg/mL rat micro-
somal protein, and 10/100/2.5/20/5 μM PHE/TOL/
DEXM/CHL/MDZ were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C
in a water bath with gentle shaking. The reaction was
initiated by addition of 1 mM NADPH and terminated
with 400 μL chilled methanol (contained the internal
standard of carbamazepine, 75 ng/ml) after 20 min incu-
bation. After shaking (2 min) and centrifugation (5000 g,
10 min), the organic phase was separated and dried. The
residues were dissolved in 200 μL of methanol and water
(50:50, v/v) and centrifuged at 10000 g for 5 min. A 10 μL
aliquot of supernatant was injected for determination of
the metabolites of five CYPs probe substrates (PAR/
OHTOL/DEXP/OHCHL/ OHMDZ) by LC-MS/MS.
RT-PCR
Total RNA were extracted from the samples of liver
(approximately 50 mg), kidney (approximately 50 mg),
lung (approximately 50 mg) and intestine (approximately
50 mg) were extracted using Trizol reagent (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the proto-
col provided by the manufacturer. The concentration of
RNA was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm.
RNA samples (2 μg) were reverse transcribed using the
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems, USA) to obtain cDNA according to the manu-
facture,s recommendations. Quantification of mRNA was
performed on the Applied Biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Foster, CA, USA) using SYBR Select Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacture,s
recommendations. PCR reactions contains an initial dena-
turating cycle at 95°C for 10 min , followed by 40 amplifi-
cation cycles: 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The primer
pairs for five CYPs and β-actin genes and predicted size of
PCR products are shown in Table 2.

Values are expressed as mean ± SD. The enzyme activity
was calculated as follows: enzyme activity = Cmetabolite ×
Lincubation/Tincubation /(CHLMs × Lincubtiaon), in which Cme-
tabolites represents the concentration of metabolites of
CYPs probe substrates, Lincubation represents the volume of
incubation system, Tincubation represents the incubation
time, and CHLMs represents the concentration of HLMs.
Values were expressed in units of pmol · min-1 · mg-1.
Independent-sample t-test was used to analyze the differ-
ences between the enzyme activities, gene expression
values with control values by SPSS 13.0. Differences were
considered significant at P < 0.05.

Influence of TAE on CYPs activity in the rat liver
After TAE treatment, CYPs activities in the rat liver
were quantified using a cocktail of probe drugs and LC-
MS/MS. TAE significantly increased the enzyme activ-
ities of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1. In the treated rats, the
three TAE dosages (6, 30, and 150 mg/kg, daily) signifi-
cantly increased the enzyme activity of CYP2E1 by 20%,
68.2%, and 146.1%, respectively, and the three TAE dosagesFigure 3 Histopathological examination of liver sections

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/306increased the levels of CYP3A1 by 27.84%, 40.3% and
51.9%, respectively, compared with those in the control
rats. The highest TAE dosage (150 mg/kg, daily) increased
the enzyme activity of CYP1A2 by 44.9% and the enzyme
activity of CYP2C11 by 35.4%. The three TAE-treated
groups were not significantly different from the control
groups in terms of CYP2D1 expression (P > 0.05; Table 3).Regulation of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 mRNA by TAE in the
rat liver, kidney, lung, and intestine
Figure 4 presents the effects of TAE on the mRNA levels
of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1. TAE at 6 and 30 mg/kg
markedly increased the mRNA levels of CYP2E1 and
CYP3A1, respectively, whereas TAE at 150 mg/kg in-
creased the mRNA levels of CYP3A1 in the rat kidney.
The mRNA levels of CYP2E1 in the rat kidney remained
unchanged. At the highest dosage, the mRNA levels of
CYP2E1 increased 2.0-, 2.9-, and 4.6-fold in the rat liver,
lung, and intestine, respectively, when normalized to the
mRNA level of β-actin. The gene expression levels of
CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 increased dosage dependently.Regulation of CYP1A2, CYP2C11, and CYP2D1 mRNA by
TAE in the rat liver, kidney, lung, and intestine
Changes in the mRNA levels of CYP1A2, CYP2C11, and
CYP2D1 were evaluated by real-time PCR. As shown in
Figure 5, TAE increased the mRNA levels of CYP1A2 at
the highest dosage and showed 2.9-, 2.4-, and 2.2-fold
increase in the CYP1A2/β-actin mRNA levels in the rat
liver, lung, and intestine. No effect of the two lower dos-
ages of TAE was observed on the gene expression levels
of CYP2C11 (P > 0.05), and only up-regulation of the
gene expression levels of CYP2C11 at the highest dosage
was significant in the rat liver, which showed 2.3-fold
increase in the CYP1A2/β-actin mRNA levels. We were
unable to detect changes in the mRNA levels of CYP2C11
in the rat kidney, lung, and intestines because of the low
gene expression levels of CYP2C11 in these organs. The
mRNA levels of CYP2D1 did not change significantly
among the three TAE dosages.Table 3 Effects of TAE from YHS on CYPs activity in the rat liv

CYP2E1 induction associated with TAE toxicity
In traditional Chinese herbal medicine, YHS is generally
used to dispel stasis and move qi, reinforce vital energy,
and relieve painful conditions such as headache, chest
pain, and abdominal pain [19]. The main active ingredient
of YHS is alkaloids; therefore, it is necessary to elucidate
the possible interactions of alkaloids with the metabolism
of drugs and other xenobiotics.
To date, some compounds in YHS have been found to
exert the inhibitory or inductive effects on CYPs [20,21], but
little is known about the effect of TAE from YHS on CYPs
expression. The present study was designed to investigate
whether TAE from YHS affects the expression of CYP1A2,
CYP2C11, CYP2D1, CYP2E1, and CYP3A1 in rats.
CYP2E1 catalyzes the biotransformation of almost 2%
of all clinically used drugs in humans [22]. Rat CYP2E1
is a homolog of human CYP2E1 [23] and is expressed in
many tissues including the liver [11]. CYP2E1 is a clas-
sical ethanol-inducible CYPs and has been extensively
studied for long because of it catalyzes the bioactivation
of several procarcinogens and protoxins including
N-nitrosodimethylamine, benzene, and carbon tetra-
chloride [24]. CYP2E1-mediated metabolism generates
reactive oxygen species, such as oxygen and hydroxyl
radicals, when these exceed the cellular detoxification
systems, it results in oxidative stress with its various
pathologic consequences [11]. Oxygen radicals play a
key role in liver injury because of their interaction with
cellular proteins or DNA [11,25]. CYP2E1 overexpres-
sion generated oxidative stress in a human hepatoma
cell line and induced cytotoxicity to the cells [26], and
CYP2E1 induction could alter immune system re-
sponses, leading to increased susceptibility to viral in-
fection [27]. Furan is metabolized by CYP2E1 to a toxic
metabolite, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial, that may interact with
proteins to cause cytotoxicity or react with nucleosides
to form substituted deoxyguanosine adducts [28].
Cases of human poisoning have occurred because of
unregulated use of proprietary biopharmaceuticals con-
taining purified THP. Several case reports associate the
development of acute or chronic hepatitis with theer

Huan Anodyne Tablets” [29,30], which contains purified,
concentrated l-THP, and the plant alkaloid responsible
for its toxicity [9,30]. In the present study, after the
treatment of rats for 14 days with TAE, both the enzyme
activity and mRNA level of CYP2E1 were significantly
increased at all three TAE dosages. The liver injury
caused by YHS may thus have resulted from the induc-
tion of the drug metabolic enzyme CYP2E1 by long-
term administration of YHS. Drug-drug interactions are
of concern when low-dosage TAE from YHS as well as
substrates of CYP2E1 are administered.
Induction ability of TAE on CYP3A1 in rats
The CYP3A subfamily is the most important hepatic
metabolic enzyme in the metabolism of 40% to 60% ofall drugs [31]. CYP3A4 is the most abundant CYP in the
human liver, where it accounts for 30% of CYPs [22],
and rat CYP3A1 is a homolog of human CYP3A4 [32].
CYP3A1 can catalyse the 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/306[33] and the metabolism of a large variety of clinical medi-
cations, including many pediatric drugs [34], cyclosporin A
[35]. Induction of CYP3A4 expression accelerated the
clearance of several clinically important drugs including
midazolam, amitriptyline, cyclosporin, and oral contracep-
tives [36]. Ginkgolide A and ginkgolide B induced the pro-
tein expression and enzyme activity of CYP3A in the
primary cultures of human hepatocytes at 30 μmol/L [37].
In the present study, CYP3A1 was significantly induced in
the rat liver, lung, and intestine at 30 mg/kg (equivalent to
the clinical dosage), suggesting that TAE has the potential
to produce CYP3A-mediated drug–drug interactions. Con-
sumption of YHS or YHS-containing products with the
substrates of CYP3A should be taken more attention be-
cause of the possibility of drug-drug interactions.
The influence of TAE on other CYPs
After the treatment of rats for 14 days with different
dosages of TAE, significant increases were observed in
the mRNA expression and enzyme activities of CYP1A2
and CYP2C11 at 150 mg/kg TAE, but the mRNA levels
and enzyme activities of CYP2D1 did not change signifi-
cantly among the three TAE dosages. In the human liver,
CYP1A2, CYP2C and CYP2D6 are involved in the me-
tabolism of 4%, 16%, and 30%, respectively, of drugs on
the market [11]. CYP1A2 is regulated primarily by the
aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and CYP1A2 is
induced by AhR-mediated transactivation following lig-
and binding and nuclear translocation [38]. AhR activa-
tion and the significant induction of the enzyme activity
of CYP1A can accelerate the biotransformation of differ-
ent procarcinogens and promutagens to carcinogens and
mutagens that bind covalently to important functional
macromolecules such as DNA, resulting in the carcino-
genic transformation of cells [12]. However, in the
present study, only rats treated with high-dosage TAE
showed an increase in the mRNA levels and enzyme ac-
tivity of CYP1A2, indicating that TAE has low potential
to produce CYP1A-mediated drug–drug interactions.
Human CYP2C9 is the major CYP2C form, accounting
for 60% of total human CYP2C [11]. Rat CYP2C11 is
considered the counterpart of human CYP2C9 and me-
tabolizes many drugs including S-warfarin and widely
used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclo-
fenac [39]. CYP2D1 is the rat orthologue of human
CYP2D6, and CYP2D6 has been the most studied hu-
man genetic polymorphism in drug metabolism [11]. In
vivo clearance of CYP2D6 substrates in poor metaboli-
zers is generally much lower than in extensive metaboli-
zers, leding to higher plasma concentrations and the
potential for clinical toxicities with therapeutic doses
[40]. Our results suggest that TAE can induce the mRNA
levels and enzyme activity of CYP2C11 in the rat liver
only at the higher concentrations tested, suggesting thatclinically important CYP2C11-mediated drug-herb inter-
actions are unlikely to be induced by TAE from YHS.
And TAE did not affect CYP2D1 mRNA level and activ-
ity in three doses, the finding suggests that the use of
products containing YHS may be considered safe when
co-administration with CYP2D1 substrates.
Conclusions
TAE from YHS significantly induced the mRNA expression
and enzyme activity of CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 in the rat
liver, lung, and intestine. Furthermore, enzyme activity cor-
related well with mRNA expression. The results of the
present dose–response study in rats suggest that potential
CYP2E1 and CYP3A drug-drug interactions are unlikely at
clinical dosages of TAE, but need to be considered when
high dosages of TAE or TAE-containing products are co-
administered with substrates of CYP1A2 or CYP2C11.
Complex herb (drug)-drug interactions may ensue from
the co-administration of YHS with other drugs, which is
mediated by CYP2E1 and CYP3A1 enzymes.
