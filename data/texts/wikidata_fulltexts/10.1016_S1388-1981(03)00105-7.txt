Potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Bintje) were stored at 20 jC for 210 days without desprouting to study the lipoxygenase pathway
during aging. After 15 days of storage, potato tubers sprouted, while after 45–60 days, apical dominance was lost and multiple sprouts
developed. Analysis of the fatty acid hydroperoxides (HPOs) revealed that 9-S-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid (9-HPOD) was the main
oxylipin formed. Between 45 and 60 days of storage, increases in the levels of 9-HPOD and colneleic acid were observed. Analysis of
phospholipids and galactolipids by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) showed that a decrease in the levels of
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), and monoga-
lactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) occurred between 0 and 45 days of aging. The decrease in the amount of linoleic acid in complex lipids
correlates well with the amount of 9-HPOD and colneleic acid produced.D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Keywords: Oxylipin; Phospholipid; Lipoxygenase pathway; Solanum tuberosum L.; Potato tuber; Colneleic acid1. Introduction
Fatty acid hydroperoxides (HPOs) are formed by autox-
idation or by the action of enzymes such as lipoxygenase
(LOX) or a-dioxygenase on polyunsaturated fatty acids [1].
HPOs are key intermediates in the LOX pathway; they can
be converted enzymatically to a variety of compounds
called oxylipins. At least seven enzymatic pathways use
HPOs as substrates: hydroperoxide lyase that cleaves HPO1388-1981/03/$ - see front matter D 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

forms precursors of a- and g-ketols and jasmonic acid,
peroxygenase that causes epoxidation and reduction of
HPO, epoxy alcohol synthase that transforms HPO into
epoxy hydroxy fatty acids, the reductase pathway that
reduces HPO into hydroxyderivatives, divinyl ether syn-
thase (DES) that produces divinyl ethers, and finally, LOX
that acts on HPO to give keto derivatives [2].
Colneleic acid and colnelenic acid are oxylipins formed
by the action of DES on the 9-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid
(9-HPOD) and the 9-hydroperoxide of linolenic acid (9-
HPOT), respectively [3]. The DES pathway was discovered
in potato tubers by Galliard and Phillips in 1972 [4].
Afterwards, colneleic and colnelenic acids were identified
in tomato roots [5] and potato leaves [6]. The 13-hydro-
peroxides of linoleic (13-HPOD) and linolenic (13-HPOT)
acid can also serve as substrates for DES, resulting in
etheroleic and etherolenic acid in garlic bulbs [7] or Ra-
nunculus plants [8,9]. DES activity has also been demon-
strated in algae [10,11].
Oxylipins are believed to play an important role in plant
defence against pathogens and in response to stress con-
M.-L. Fauconnier et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1633 (2003) 118–126 119ditions such as injury [1,12]. Volatile oxylipins have also
been shown to act as signaling molecules between plants
[13]. While there has been much study of jasmonic acid in
the past decade, recently the importance of other oxylipin
pathways in plant resistance to pathogens has been
revealed. In potato plants, Weber et al. [6] showed that
the divinyl ethers colneleic and colnelenic acids had an
inhibitory effect on Phytophthora infestans, the causal
agent of late blight disease, suggesting a function in plant
defence for DES. In potato cell suspension cultures treated
with elicitor from P. infestans, the DES pathway was the
major pathway induced [14–16].
Although our knowledge of oxylipins’ role in the
defence of plants against pathogens and stress is increas-
ing rapidly, almost nothing is known about the role of
these molecules in aging and senescence. Even though
LOX is often proposed to be responsible for peroxidative
damage to membrane lipids during aging and senescence,
its role is far from clear. LOX activity increases during
senescence of rose petals [17], daylily petals [18], carna-
tion petals [19], and pea foliage [20], but clearly
decreases during soybean seed aging [21], soybean coty-
ledon senescence [22] or in detached wheat and rye
leaves [23]. In a previous study [24], we showed that
in potato tubers stored at 20 jC, LOX activity and the
total HPO content decreased during aging, even during
the period after 120 days when membrane integrity
dropped drastically. The few previous studies on the
LOX pathway during aging or senescence have deter-
mined only total LOX activity; in this study, we have
characterised in detail the fatty acid HPOs and their
products that accumulated during tuber storage. We have
also investigated the origin of the precursors of HPO, i.e.
the polyunsaturated fatty acids that are potentially derived
from phospholipids and galactolipids.2. Materials and methods
2.1. Plant material and sampling
Potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Bintje) were
obtained at harvest from a local market. Tubers with
lengths between 60 and 65 mm were selected for the
study. The selected tubers were washed and stored for 2
weeks at room temperature to allow wound healing. The
ages were calculated from the end of the wound-healing
period. The tubers were stored for 210 days at 20 jC
with a relative humidity of 90% in the dark without
desprouting. Samples were taken after 0, 15, 30, 45, 60,
90, 120, 150, 180 and 210 days. For each sampling, 10
tubers were randomly taken and cut into two parts
transversely; sprouts, when present, were removed be-
fore sampling. In each tuber half, a core was taken with
a punch (18 mm in diameter) perpendicular to the
cutting axis. The cylinders were then cut, and materialfrom the centre of the tuber was discarded, so that the
remaining core weighed 10 g. The samples were imme-
diately frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered in a mill and
stored at  80 jC. The last operations were performed
rapidly to minimize wounding responses during sampling.
Analysis of a sample that had not been stored at 20 jC,
after 0, 6, and 12 months at  80 jC indicated that
storage at  80 jC did not result in autoxidation of
lipids.
2.2. Phospholipid and galactolipid analysis
2.2.1. Extraction
Two milliliters of isopropanol (0.01% w/v BHT) at 75 jC
were added to 1 g of potato powder. The mixture was
incubated at 75 jC for 15 min, followed by addition of 1
ml of chloroform and 0.8 ml of distilled water. The tubes
were shaken for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged
10 min at 1200 g. The liquid was removed and the plant
material was re-extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1)
containing 0.01% w/v BHT for 30 min. This last operation
was repeated five times and the extraction liquids were
combined, washed with 2 ml of 1 M KCl, filtered, and
evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The lipid extract was
redissolved in 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The
lipid extracts were stored at  80 jC until analysis.
2.2.2. Analysis
Phospholipid and galactolipid analyses were performed
by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-
MS/MS) using internal standards as described in [25],
except that, for phospholipid analysis, 150 Al of extract
were used, and for galactolipid analysis, 225 Al of extract
were used. The extraction and analysis were performed on
five independent samples of potato tubers at each time point.
Each lipid species amount shown is the mean of the five
determinations + standard deviation.
2.3. Quantitation of 9- and 13-HPOD, HPOT, colneleic
acid, and colnelenic acid by HPLC
2.3.1. Extraction
Four hundred microliters of 1.8 10 4 M 15-HEDE
(15-hydroxy-11,13 eicosadienoic acid, internal standard)
were added to 5 g of potato tuber powder that was
extracted with 15 ml of diethyl ether at room temperature
for 10 min. The powder was re-extracted with 10 ml of
diethyl ether for 10 min at room temperature and the ether
fractions were pooled and dried with anhydrous sodium
sulfate. Extraction yields, which were determined by
addition of a known amount of each compound to potato
powder before analysis, were 87F 3% (n = 5) for 15-
HEDE (the internal standard), 85F 2.5% (n = 5) for 13-
HPOT, and 82F 4% (n = 5) for colneleic acid. The solvent
was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and the extracted
compounds were redissolved in 100 Al of acetonitrile. A
M.-L. Fauconnier et al. / Biochimica et Bi120blank was made with the same protocol omitting the potato
powder.
2.3.2. Analysis
The analysis was performed with a Hewlett Packard
series 1050 HPLC (with a diode array detector) on an
Inertsil 250 4.6 mm 5 ODS-2 column (Chrompack,
Middelburg, The Netherlands) with a flow rate of 0.7
ml/min. Solvent A was water containing 0.01% v/v tri-
fluoroacetic acid; solvent B was acetonitrile containing
0.01% v/v trifluoroacetic acid. Elution conditions were:
0–61 min, 47% solvent A; 61–63 min, a gradient from
47% A to 20% A; 63–74 min, 20% A; 74–75 min, from
20% A to 0% A; 75–95 min, 100% B. For re-equilibra-
tion, the flow was continued from 95 to 100 min with a
gradient from 0% A to 47% A and from 100 to 105 min at
47% A. Identification of 9- and 13-HPOD and HPOT and
of colneleic and colneleic acid was based on their UV
spectra and retention time by comparison with pure com-
pounds synthesised, extracted, purified by preparative
HPLC, derivatised, and characterised by gas chromatogra-
phy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis according to
Fauconnier et al. [26] for HPO and to Weber et al. [6]
for colneleic and colnelenic acid. All the experiments were
performed in triplicate (on three independent potato tuber
extracts) and the results shown are the meansF standard
deviations.
2.4. Quantitation of HPO formed by autoxidation
2.4.1. Extraction
Four hundred microliters of 1.8 10 4 M 15-HEDE
(15-hydroxy-11,13-eicosadienoic acid, internal standard)
were added to 1 g of potato tuber powder which was
homogenised with 2 ml of 0.2 N NaOH containing 5%
(w/v) of NaBH4 at 4 jC for 45 s with a Waring blender. The
mixture was acidified with 60% HClO4 (v/v) to pH 4 and
extracted with 5 ml of methanol/chloroform (50:50, v/v).
The mixture was centrifuged 5 min at 1200 g to allow
phase separation; the chloroform phase was removed and
the upper phase was re-extracted twice with 4 ml of
chloroform. The chloroform phases were pooled and evap-
orated to dryness with a rotary evaporator at room temper-
ature. The extract was redissolved in 1.5 ml of hexane/
diethyl ether (70:30, v/v). It can be noted that preformed
hydroxy acids, present in very low amounts in potato, were
included in the determination of fatty acid HPOs, when this
reduction method was utilized.
2.4.2. Analysis
Non-enzymatic formation of oxylipins was assessed by
comparing the amounts of species that are formed both
enzymatically and non-enzymatically with the amount of
species that are formed only non-enzymatically. HPO were
quantified as their hydroxyderivatives by HPLC using stand-
ards to identify HPO isomers [27].2.5. Chiral analysis of HPOs
2.5.1. Extraction
The extraction was performed as described in Section
2.3, but using 25 g of potato tubers and redissolving the
extracts in 3 ml of acetonitrile.
2.5.2. Purification of 9- and 13-HPOD by preparative
HPLC
The purification was performed on a Hewlett Packard HP
1050 HPLC using a diode array detector with detection at
234 nm. The separation was performed on an Inertsil 5
ODS-2 (250 10 mm) column. Five hundred microliters
were injected, and the flow rate was 2.6 ml/min. Solvent A
was water containing trifluoroacetic acid at 0.01% v/v,
solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.01% v/v trifluoro-
acetic acid. The solvent sequence for elution was: 0–4 min,
50% A to 40% A; 4–30 min, 40% A; 30–32 min, 40–35%
A; 32–39 min 35% A; 39–40 min, 35–0% A; 40–55 min,
100% B. For re-equilibration, the flow was continued from
55 to 60 min with a gradient from 0% to 50% A, and from
60 to 65 min at 50% A. The fractions were collected based
on their retention time and UV spectra. Solvent was evap-
orated to dryness, and the samples were redissolved in 1 ml
of diethyl ether and reduced by addition of 2 mg of NaBH4.
After 10 min of reaction at 4 jC, the ether fraction was
removed, and the solvent was evaporated to dryness under
nitrogen. The samples were redissolved in 1 ml of methanol.
2.5.3. Chiral analysis of hydroxyderivatives
The analysis was performed with a Chiralcel OD column
(250 4.6 mm from Diacel Chemical Industries, Interchim,
France) [28].
2.6. GC-MS analysis of oxylipins
2.6.1. Extraction and esterification
Potato tuber powder (25 g) was extracted with 75 ml of
diethyl ether at room temperature for 10 min. The organic
phase was removed and the potato powder was extracted
again with 75 ml of diethyl ether. The ether extracts were
pooled, filtered and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate.
The solvent was evaporated to dryness with a rotary
evaporator and redissolved in 1.5 ml of diethyl ether. The
extract was esterified with 2 ml of diazomethane for 10 min
at 0 jC.
2.6.2. Analysis
Analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies
6890 GC-MS with a Agilent Technologies HP 5 MS column
(30 m 0.25 mm with a phase thickness of 0.25 Am). The
splitless injector was at 275 jC, and the temperature
programme was: 1 min at 35 jC, then from 35 to 300 jC
at 5 jC per minute. The ionisation potential was fixed at 70
eV with a mass range of 50–550 a.m.u. The injected
volume was 1 Al. The acquisition was also performed in

3.1. Physiological changes during potato tuber aging
Potato tubers are organs of vegetative propagation that
can maintain viability up to 3 years under optimal storage
conditions: low temperature and high relative humidity.
Under our experimental conditions (20 jC), potato tubers
sprout rapidly and undergo accelerated aging. After 210
days of storage, the fresh weight of the tubers decreased
22F 2% (average of 10 determinations). During storage of
potato tubers, four stages of physiological development
could be described [29]: (1) dormancy, during which there
is no sprouting even under favourable conditions, which
corresponded to the period from 0 to 15 days under our
conditions, (2) apical dominance, in which only one sprout
develops, which corresponded to the period from 15 to 45
days, (3) the multiple sprout stage, in which apical domi-
nance is released and more than one bud sprouts at the
same time, which began around 45–60 days, and (4) the
daughter tuber stage, in which sprouts are replaced by
daughter tubers appearing directly on the mother tuber; this
stage did not occur during the 210 days of aging in our
experiments.
3.2. HPOs during aging of potato tubers
The extraction and HPLC method that we have devel-
oped allow the rapid and single-step determination of
individual HPOs, colneleic and colnelenic acid. As we
previously described [30], because potato tubers don’t
contain large amount of HPO lyase, HPOs can be extracted
and quantified without reduction to the correspondingFig. 1. Fatty acid hydroperoxide concentrations during aging of potato
tubers. HPO were extracted by diethyl ether without reduction and
analysed by HPLC. The analysis was performed on three independent
extracts. 9-HPOD, 9-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid; 9-HPOT, 9-hydro-
peroxide of linolenic acid; 13-HPOD, 13 hydroperoxide of linoleic acid;
13-HPOT, 13-hydroperoxide of linolenic acid.alcohols. Omitting the reduction step is more rapid and
allows separate determination of hydroxy fatty acids that
may be formed in the plant. Hydroxy fatty acids were
identified in the samples on the basis of their retention
time and UV spectrum, compared to standards, but the
hydroxy fatty acid concentration was so low that the
quantification was not possible. The HPO concentration
during storage is presented in Fig. 1 (nmol/g fresh weight).
Calculation of these quantities took extraction yield into
account, as hydroperoxides, represented by 13-HPOT, and
15-HEDE (the internal standard) were determined to have
similar extraction yields: 85F 3% (n = 5) for 13-HPOT and
87F 3% (n = 5) for 15-HEDE. The 9-isomers of HPO, in
particular 9-HPOD, were the main species formed in
potato tubers. The formation of higher levels of HPOD
than HPOT is consistent with the higher levels of HPOD’s
precursor, 18:2, than HPOT’s precursor, 18:3, in potato
tubers [24]. 13-HPOD was present in the tuber at very low
concentration, but its levels are not shown in the figure, as
it is difficult to quantify because its retention time is very
close to that of 9-HPOD. The maximal concentration of 9-
HPOT was reached at 45 days, and the maximal concen-
tration of 9-HPOD was reached at 60 days. Following
these peaks, the HPO concentration dropped and remained
low for all the isomers until the end of the experiment
(210 days).
To determine whether the origins of the HPOs were
enzymatic, analysis of autoxidation products and chiral
analysis of the HPOs were performed. Table 1 shows the
percentage of 12- and 16-HPOT formed by autoxidation
compared to the 9- and 13-HPOD and HPOT that can be
either formed enzymatically or by autoxidation. The low
levels of 12- and 16-HPOT indicated that autoxidation was
only responsible for a small part of the HPO present in the
tuber. During aging, the autoxidation of fatty acids in-
creased, but the phenomenon was still quite limited. In
senescing leaf, non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation has been
demonstrated to play a dominant role in lipid peroxidation
[31], but this was clearly not the case in potato tubers even
after 210 days of storage at 20 jC. Chiral analysis of 9-
and 13-HPOD after HPLC purification of the sample from
0 days of storage confirmed the importance of the enzy-
matic formation of these species. There was a large
enantiomeric excess of the S form; 67% of 13-HPOD
was in the S form, and 91% of the 9-HPOD was in the
M.-L. Fauconnier et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1633 (2003) 118–126122S form. Thus, it is apparent that lipoxygenase and, in
particular, LOX-1 was mainly responsible for the synthesis
of HPO in the tubers. Indeed, the 9-isomers of HPOs were
the major HPOs formed, consistent with the specificity of
LOX-1 [32].
3.3. Oxylipins during aging of potato tubers
HPLC analysis of a crude diethyl ether extract of potato
tuber revealed only the presence of HPOs, colneleic acid,
colnelenic acid, and slight traces of hydroxy fatty acids,
whatever the storage time or the wavelength of the UV
detector (diode array). Colneleic and colnelenic acid content
in the tuber during aging are shown in Fig. 2 (nmol/g fresh
weight). Again, the measured quantities took into account
extraction yield, as the measured extraction yields of colne-
leic acid (82F 4%, n = 5) and of the internal standard, 15-
HEDE (87F 3%, n = 5), were similar. Colneleic acid was
present in larger quantities than colnelenic acid, which is in
agreement with the higher concentration of 9-HPOD, the
precursor of colneleic acid, compared to 9-HPOT, the
precursor of colnelenic acid. The time course of the changes
in colneleic acid levels during the storage was quite similar
to that of the changes in 9-HPOD levels. Although the data
show that at the initial time point, colneleic acid levels are
high and HPOD levels are low, our previous work has
shown that tuber metabolism at the start of storage can be
variable, probably due to postharvest stress [24]. While
initial metabolism may be erratic, changes later in the aging
process are reproducible. Both the colneleic acid and 9-
HPOD levels showed a clear increase around 45 days of
storage, but colneleic acid was always five to ten times less
concentrated than 9-HPOD. The phenomenon could be
explained by two possible mechanisms: 9-HPOD was con-
verted by other enzymatic systems to other oxylipins, or
colneleic acid was the main species formed but it was
converted to other species.
To identify other oxylipins potentially formed, GC-MS
analysis was performed on a diethyl ether extract after
esterification by diazomethane on samples stored 0, 60,Fig. 2. Colneleic and colnelenic acid concentrations during aging of potato
tubers. The acids were extracted with diethyl ether and analysed by HPLC.
The analysis was performed on three independent extracts.and 210 days. This technique confirmed the presence of
HPOD and HPOT and colneleic acid, and identified 9-oxo-
nonanoic acid. HPOD and HPOT identification of individual
species was based on retention time compared with pure
HPOs esterified with diazomethane. GC-MS was used only
for confirmation of the presence of HPOs and not for
quantitation (which was preformed by HPLC), because
HPOs can undergo thermal rearrangements during GC
analysis. Colneleic acid methyl ester was easily identified
on the basis of its retention time (40.5 min) and fragmenta-
tion pattern (m/z = 308 (17), 251 (5), 165 (12), 151 (12), 137
(23), 123 (27), 109 (29), 95 (60), 81 (94), 67 (100), 55 (63))
in comparison with pure compound esterified with diazo-
methane. 9-oxo-nonanoic acid methyl ester was identified in
each of the three extracts (0, 60 and 210 days of storage) on
the basis of its retention time (23 min) and mass spectrum (m/
z = 186 (2), 143 (4), 127 (9), 87 (40), 74 (100), 59 (22), 55
(35)). Because the colneleic acid and 9-oxo nonanoic acid
fragments were identified only in the potato samples and not
when pure HPOs were analyzed under the same conditions, it
is clear that these compounds originated from the tubers. For
highest sensitivity, SIM was employed to search for other
oxylipins potentially formed in the extracts. Three ions
characteristic of the methyl ester of each oxylipin were
monitored (molecular ion and two intense and typical
fragments). Detection of the following compounds was
attempted: methyl esters of ketodienoic acid, methyl ester
of 12-oxo-9Z-dodecenoic acid, methyl ester of 12-oxo-10E
dodecenoic acid, methyl ester of epoxyhydroxyoctadece-
noic, and decadienoic acid, methyl ester of trihydroxiocta-
decenoic acid, a and g ketols, methyl ester of jasmonic acid
and of oxo-phytodienoic acid. Under our extraction and
analysis conditions, none of these species were detected.
Analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether derivatives also did not
result in detection of other oxylipins (data not shown).
It has previously been shown that colneleic acid is the
main oxylipin in potato cells but hydroxy fatty acids and
trihydroxy fatty acids were also identified upon elicitor
treatment [14]. Colneleic acid is clearly involved in plant
defence against pathogens [6,14] and is also an inhibitor of
LOX activity [33], but this work is the first indication for a
role of colneleic acid during the normal life cycle of the
tuber, and for a potential role of colneleic acid in sprout
development. It is unlikely that the 9-oxo-nonanoic acid
methyl ester in the extracts was formed by the action of
HPO lyase on 9-HPOD and HPOT, because it has been
demonstrated that potato tuber HPO lyase is specific for 13-
HPOD and HPOT [30,34], and the tubers contained little
13-HPOD and HPOT. Moreover, HPO lyase activity rap-
idly drops to zero during tuber storage [30]. Since 9-oxo-
nonanoic acid is present even after 210 days of aging, we
postulate that it is not formed by HPO lyase, but that it is a
degradation product originating from colneleic acid. It has
been demonstrated that the degradation pathway of colne-
leic and colnelenic acid forms the same products as HPO
lyase does [35].
et Biophysica Acta 1633 (2003) 118–126 1233.4. Phospholipid and galactolipid content of potato tubers
during aging
In order to investigate the origin of the fatty acids that are
substrates for the lipoxygenase pathway, analysis of phos-
pholipids and galactolipids, was undertaken by ESI-MS/
MS, a rapid and sensitive method for quantitative determi-
nation of membrane lipids and their individual molecular
species. Lipid profiling by ESI-MS/MS requires only simple
sample preparation and small amounts of plant material.
This technique has been used previously to profile mem-
brane lipids in a plant stress response [25], and here it is
utilized in a new application. Analysis of lipid extracts by
ESI-MS/MS allowed the identification and quantification of
the principal phospholipids and galactolipids during the
storage of potato tubers. Fig. 3 shows the concentrations
(nmol/g fresh weight) of the main classes of phospholipids
and galactolipids during the storage period. Levels of the
major non-plastidic phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine
(PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylino-
sitol (PI), decreased rapidly between 0 and 45 days of
storage and remained low at 60 days. Between 60 days
and 90 days, when multiple sprouts were growing, the levels
of PC, PE, and PI increased 4–5-fold, then remained
relatively steady from 90 to 210 days. The major plastidic
galactolipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and
digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) followed a similar pat-
tern. Levels of the major plastidic phospholipid, phosphati-
dylglycerol (PG), underwent much smaller changes with
only a small increase toward the end of the storage period.

M.-L. Fauconnier et al. / BiochimicaFig. 3. Phospholipid and galactolipid levels during aging of potato tubers. The an
time point.jC accounted for just a small fraction of the observed
increases in lipid content between 60 and 90 days, and
certainly did not account for the drop in lipid content
between 0 and 45 days. The drop in lipid content between
0 and 45 days is likely to be directly related to the large
increases in 9-HPOD, 9-HPOT, colneleic acid, and colne-
lenic acids, whose levels peaked at 45–60 days. Indeed, the
amount of these compounds present at 45–60 days was
about 100 nmol/g fresh weight (Figs. 1 and 2). This
correlates well with the amount of loss of complex polar
lipids between 0 and 45 days, when the total of these species
dropped 113 nmol/g fresh weight; most of the hydrolysed
lipids were diacyl species containing about 47% 18:2 and
15% 18:3 [24]. On the other hand, the physiological basis
for the increases in PC, PE, PI, PA, MGDG, and DGDG
levels between 60 and 90 days is less clear, and future
investigation of the basis for this increase is warranted.
The relative amounts of the lipid classes also varied
during aging. In decreasing prevalence, the main classes of
lipids are PC>DGDG>PI at 0 days of storage, while
PC>PE>PI after 210 days of storage. These alterations in
the relative amounts of PC, PE, and DGDG are in agreement
with those observed during 38-month storage of the potato
variety De´sire´e at 4 jC by Zabrouskov and Knowles [36],
who found that PC and DGDG were the main lipid classes
in young tubers while PC and PE were dominant in older
samples (38 months). These workers also observed in-
creases in PC and PE levels during storage [36].

phosphatidylglycerol (lysoPG) may be formed by degrada-alysis was performed by ESI-MS/MS on five independent extracts at each
M.-L. Fauconnier et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1633 (2003) 118–126124tion of the other phospholipid classes. These lipids were
present at high levels in potato tuber. Initially, PA accounted
for 9.1F1.1 mol% of the total lipid, while lysoPC, lysoPE,
and lysoPG accounted for 12.2F 2.5%, 4.1F 0.3%, and
0.4F 0.1% of the total lipids, respectively. In contrast to the
other diacyl phospholipids, except PG, PA levels remained
constant for the initial 60 days of storage. Interestingly,
lysoPC and lysoPE levels dropped during this period, like
their diacyl counterparts. These data suggest that the
lipase(s) that produce the free fatty acids used as LOX
substrates must have removed the fatty acids from both the
sn1 and sn2 positions of polar lipids, without accumulation
of lysoPC or lysoPE. In fact, lipases found in potato tuber
vacuoles, the patatins, have low specificity; recently it was
demonstrated that a recombinant patatin-like Arabidopsis
enzyme is capable of hydrolysing acyl groups from both sn1
and sn2 positions of phospholipids [37]. Between 60 and 90
days of aging, PA, lysoPC, and lysoPE levels all increased
2–3-fold. LysoPC and lysoPE levels dropped again between
90 and 210 days of storage. These changes resulted in a
continuous drop throughout the aging period in the mole
percentage of lysoPC and lysoPE in the total lipids, so that
at 210 days, lysoPC accounted for only 1.9F 0.2% and
lysoPE for 0.7F 0.1% of the total lipid.Fig. 4. Phospholipid and galactolipid molecular species during aging of potato tub
masses significantly greater than 0.2 nmol/g fresh weight are shown. (A) Aging fo
performed by ESI-MS/MS on five independent extracts at each time point.The molecular species of membrane lipids at 0, 60, and
210 days are shown in Fig. 4. ESI-MS/MS analysis allows
us to determine the amounts of individual lipid molecular
species. In each head group class, species are identified in
terms of the total number of acyl carbons and the total
number of double bonds. Molecular species containing 34
carbons and two double bonds are major molecular species
of PC, PE, PI, PA, PG, and DGDG, while molecular species
containing 36 carbons and four double bonds are prominent
species of PC, PE, PA, and DGDG. Since potato tubers
contain high levels (47%) of 18:2 and very low levels
(0.5%) of 18:1 [24], the 34:2 species must be largely a
combination of 16:0 and 18:2 (rather than 18:1–18:1),
while the 36:4 species must be largely an 18:2–18:2
combination (rather than 18:1–18:3). The most abundant
lysophospholipid acyl species was 18:2. Examination of
Fig. 4 shows that the ratio of the 36:4 to 34:2 species of PC,
PE, PI, and PA tended to be lower at 60 days than at either 0
or 210 days. This suggests that there may have been some
preferential hydrolysis of 36:4 (18:2–18:2) as compared to
other molecular species of PC, PE, PI, and PA at the time of
formation of 9-HPOD and colneleic acid, and that perhaps
36:4 (18:2–18:2) species were preferentially hydrolysed,
releasing the LOX substrate, 18:2. Similarly, the 18:2ers. Note the differences in the scales among the three graphs. Species with

than the other lyso molecular species between 0 and 60
days, suggesting that these 18:2 lysophospholipids might
also have undergone some preferential hydrolysis. However,
essentially all molecular species of PC, PE, PI, MGDG, and
DGDG were decreased at 60 days compared to 0 days (Figs.
3 and 4; note scales in Fig. 4), and any discrimination
among molecular species by the enzymes that catalysed the
lipid degradation that occurred between 0 and 60 days was a
subtle phenomenon.
In a previous study, we determined that membrane
integrity dropped drastically between 120 and 240 days of
aging [24]. In that study, we showed that that the double
bond index (DBI) of fatty acid species of potato tubers
fluctuated during aging of tubers. ESI-MS/MS analysis of
phospholipids and galactolipids confirmed that there were
no major shifts toward either more unsaturated or saturated
molecular species (Fig. 4). Thus, it is unlikely that changes
in unsaturation contributed significantly to the alterations in
membrane integrity that were observed previously. Since
levels of fatty acid HPOs were also relatively low at the end
of the storage period, it is also unlikely that the presence of
these species contributed to the loss of membrane integrity.
Our ESI-MS/MS data demonstrate that incorporation into
complex lipids was not a major fate of hydroperoxy fatty
acids. No increases were detected during aging in complex
lipid species with masses that might be expected for species
containing hydroperoxides. For example, 18:2-HPOD PC,
would have the same nominal mass as 38:2 PC, and the
species that we have identified as ‘‘38:2 PC’’ could poten-
tially include some 18:2-HPOD PC. However, this species
was present in low amounts (1.4 mol% of PC species), and
there was no increase in the mole percentage of the species
identified as ‘‘38:2 PC’’ during aging (Fig. 4). LysoPCs and
lysoPEs, which can destabilize membrane structure, were
also at their lowest levels at the end of the storage period.
On the other hand, the mole percentages of PE and PA
increased from 12% and 9% of the total polar lipids to 18%
and 16%, respectively, while PC levels dropped slightly,
from 21% to 19% during the aging. These changes might
have led to formation of non-bilayer lipids that destabilized
membrane structure, since both PE and PA have the capacity
to form non-bilayer phases [38,39].4. Concluding remarks
Our results demonstrate that, during aging and sprouting
in potato tubers, the LOX pathway is activated. The LOX
pathway seems to be finely regulated as high enzymatic
activities and product accumulation are restricted to a
narrow window of time during the storage period, with
levels of products peaking at 45–60 days of aging. Gal-
actolipases and phospholipases liberate free fatty acids,
including 18:2, which are peroxidised to HPOs by LOX.
HPOs are then converted by DES to colneleic acid, which isdegraded to 9-oxo-nonanoic acid. The roles of colneleic acid
and 9-oxo-nonanoic acid in tubers during aging remain to be
determined. We have previously demonstrated that mem-
brane integrity drops after 120 days of tuber aging. How-
ever, during that late period of aging, fatty acid HPO content
is low. Thus, oxygenated lipid species are not the main
cause of the loss of membrane integrity.Acknowledgements
