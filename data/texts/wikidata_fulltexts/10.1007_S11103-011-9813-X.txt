Abstract Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum habro-
chaites (f. typicum) accession PI127826 emit a variety of
sesquiterpenes. To identify terpene synthases involved in
the production of these volatile sesquiterpenes, we used
massive parallel pyrosequencing (RNA-seq) to obtain the
transcriptome of the stem trichomes from these plants. This
approach resulted initially in the discovery of six sesqui-
terpene synthase cDNAs from S. lycopersicum and ﬁve
from S. habrochaites. Searches of other databases and the
S. lycopersicum genome resulted in the discovery of two
additional sesquiterpene synthases expressed in trichomes.
The sesquiterpene synthases from S. lycopersicum and
S. habrochaites have high levels of protein identity.
Several of them appeared to encode for non-functional
proteins. Functional recombinant proteins produced ger-
macrenes, b-caryophyllene/a-humulene, viridiﬂorene and
valencene from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate. However, the
activities of these enzymes do not completely explain the
differences in sesquiterpene production between the two
tomato plants. RT-qPCR conﬁrmed high levels of expres-
sion of most of the S. lycopersicum sesquiterpene synthases
in stem trichomes. In addition, one sesquiterpene synthase
was induced by jasmonic acid, while another appeared to
be slightly repressed by the treatment. Our data provide a
foundation to study the evolution of terpene synthases in
cultivated and wild tomato.

Introduction
Terpenoids constitute a large class of chemical compounds
produced by most, if not all, living organisms. Over 23,000
different terpenoid compounds have been characterized
(Sacchettini and Poulter 1997). Plants produce terpenoids
that function in primary metabolism such as phytohor-
mones (abscisic acid, gibberellins, cytokinins, and brassi-
nosteroids), are part of photosynthetic pigments (phytol
and carotenoids), electron carriers (ubiquinone) or consti-
tute structural components of membranes (phytosterol).
However, the majority of plant terpenoids are secondary, or
specialized metabolites, present only in a subset of plant
lineages. They can be active as direct defensive com-
pounds, such as phytoalexins that accumulate upon path-
ogen infection (Akram et al. 2008). In addition, volatile
terpenoids can function as indirect defensive compounds
by attracting predators or parasitoids of the attacking insect

DOI 10.1007/s11103-011-9813-x(Walling 2000). The emission of different terpenoids is
induced by insect herbivory (Kant et al. 2004; Olson et al.
2008; Navia-Gine et al. 2009).
Two distinct pathways leading to the universal terpene
precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl
diphosphate (DMAPP) operate in plants. The mevalonate
(MVA) pathway produces IPP in the cytosol, which can be
converted to DMAPP by IPP isomerase. The 2-C-methyl-D-
erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway produces plastidial
IPP and DMAPP. Head-to-tail elongation of IPP with
DMAPP catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate (GPP) synthase
or by neryl diphosphate (NPP) synthase lead to the for-
mation of GPP and NPP (the (Z,Z)-isomer of GPP; Croteau
and Karp 1979), respectively, which are the precursors for
monoterpenes. (E,E)-Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and
(Z,Z)-Farnesyl diphosphate (Kellog and Poulter 1997)
serve as precursors for sesquiterpenes, and are synthesized
by (Z,Z)- and (E,E)-FPP synthases, respectively. (E,E,E)-
Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase catalyzes
formation of GGPP, the diterpene precursor. The MEP
pathway provides precursors for the synthesis of mono-
terpenes and diterpenes in plastids, whereas sesquiterpenes
are derived from precursors of the MVA pathway in the
cytosol. However, exchange of precursor between cytosol
and plastids has been reported. Snapdragon ﬂowers can
synthesize sesquiterpenes from plastidial isoprenes, indi-
cating transport of IPP from the plastids to the cytosol
(Dudareva et al. 2005). More recently it was shown that
several sesquiterpenes from wild tomato (Solanum habro-
chaites) are synthesized in the plastids from plastidial
(Z,Z)-FPP (Sallaud et al. 2009).
The prenyl diphosphates are converted to terpenes by
the action of terpene synthases (TPSs), a group of struc-
turally and evolutionarily related enzymes (Chen et al.
2011). Induced terpenoid synthesis is often correlated with
induced expression of terpene synthases (Zulak et al. 2009;
Navia-Gine et al. 2009; Herde et al. 2008). Besides regu-
lation at the level of terpene synthases, induction of pre-
cursor biosynthetic genes has also been reported (Kant
et al. 2004; Ament et al. 2004). In vitro, sesquiterpene
synthases can often produce monoterpenes when provided
with GPP as substrate, and monoterpene synthases can
produce sesquiterpenes when provided with FPP. There-
fore, subcellular targeting of terpene synthases determines
which substrate the terpene synthase encounters. For
instance, two nearly identical terpene synthases from
snapdragon both catalyze the conversion of GPP to linalool
and of FPP to nerolidol in vitro. However, only one of
these linalool/nerolidol synthases has a transit peptide,
localizing the protein to the plastids (Nagegowda et al.
2008).
To be effective against pests and diseases, defensive
terpenoid compounds are often produced at the surface of
the plant. Trichomes, which are specialized secretory
structures on the surface of leaves and stems, contain high
levels of terpenes in many species (Chatzivasileiadis et al.
1999; Besser et al. 2009), as well as other secondary
metabolites (van Schie et al. 2007; Fridman et al. 2005;
Ben-Israel et al. 2009). Furthermore, many investigations
have shown that these compounds, including terpenes, are
usually synthesized de novo in the trichomes (Maes et al.
2011; Olsson et al. 2009).
New terpene synthases are often discovered by homol-
ogy-based cloning (van Der Hoeven et al. 2000; Portnoy
et al. 2008; van Schie et al. 2007; Jones et al. 2008), by
random sequencing of cDNAs (van Der Hoeven et al.
2000; Wang et al. 2008) followed by bioinformatic sear-
ches of the resulting EST databases (Keeling et al. 2011)o r
by genome mining (Aubourg et al. 2002; Martin et al.
2010). Terpene synthases that are less abundant in a par-
ticular organ or structure, or have low sequence similarity
to known terpene synthases might not be identiﬁed by these
methods. Therefore, we set out to use massive parallel
pyrosequencing of the tomato trichome transcriptome in
order to ﬁnd new sesquiterpene synthases present in tomato
stem trichomes. The use of massive parallel pyrosequenc-
ing of transcripts, termed ‘‘RNA-seq’’ is becoming more
widely used (Schilmiller et al. 2010; Wilhelm and Landry
2009). The advantage of RNA-seq above the construction
of EST databases is that quantitative expression levels of
transcripts are better estimated due to the larger set of data.
Here we describe the identiﬁcation and characterization
of seven sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from Solanum
lycopersicum and six sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from
Solanum habrochaites, a wild tomato species, by using
RNA-seq on cDNA from stem trichomes. Functional
expression in E. coli provided information on product
speciﬁcity of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs.
Determination of tissue-speciﬁc expression of the culti-
vated tomato sesquiterpene genes showed that the expres-
sion of most of them was highest in tissue containing
trichomes. Furthermore, one sesquiterpene synthase in the
cultivated tomato was induced by jasmonic acid treatment,
suggesting its involvement in herbivore-induced terpenoid
emission.
Materials and methods
Plant material and mRNA isolation
Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cultivar Money-
maker and Solanum habrochaites accession PI127826)
were obtained from Enza Zaden (Enkhuizen, The Nether-
lands) and grown in soil in a greenhouse with day/night
temperatures of 23–18C and a 16/8 h light/dark regime for
324 Plant Mol Biol (2011) 77:323–336
1234 weeks. Cuttings were made, which were placed in soil
and grown for another 3 weeks. Trichomes from the stem
and petioles were collected at the bottom of a 50 ml tube
by vortexing frozen petiole and stem segments in liquid
nitrogen as described before (van Schie et al. 2007). RNA
of trichomes was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy plant
Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mes-
senger RNA was isolated from the pool of total RNA using
the PolyAtract mRNA isolation system III from Promega
(Madison, Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufactur-
ers’ instructions. Messenger RNA was isolated from total
RNA with an efﬁciency between 0.56 and 0.81%. Terpenes
stored in trichomes were sampled by transferring approx-
imately 25 mg trichomes to a 20 ml glass vial containing
2 ml saturated CaCl2 (5 M) buffered in 100 mM Na-Ace-
tate at pH 4.5. Vials were capped immediately and kept at
8C prior to sampling with a Solid Phase Micro Extraction
ﬁber (SPME), as described below.
mRNA ampliﬁcation and double stranded cDNA
synthesis
The MessageAmp II aRNA ampliﬁcation kit from Ambion
(Austin, Texas, USA) was used to amplify trichome
mRNA. An aliquot of 100 ng of mRNA was used as input
for ampliﬁcation. Ampliﬁcation was carried out according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The yield of ampliﬁed anti-
sense strand RNA was 171 lg for S. lycopersicum and 144
lg for S. habrochaites. The size ranged from *400 to
3,000 bases.
First strand cDNA synthesis from the ampliﬁed RNA
was carried out with random hexamer primers. Synthesis
was performed in batches using 10 lg RNA in 20 ll
reactions. Random primers at a ﬁnal concentration of 62.5
nM were combined with ampliﬁed RNA and incubated at
70C for 5 min in a thermo-cycler (Biometra, Go ¨ttingen,
Germany) after which the sample was transferred to ice.
Subsequently, RevertAid M-MulV H
- reverse transcrip-
tase from Fermentas Life Sciences (St. Leon-Rot, Ger-
many) in combination with the supplied buffer was added
with 1 mM nucleotides. First strand cDNA synthesis was
carried out at 42C for 90 min. Directly thereafter, reac-
tions were transferred to ice and second strand synthesis
was performed using Fermentas RNase H and DNA poly-
merase I from E. coli. To each 20 ll reaction tube 8 llo f
the supplied DNA polymerase I reaction buffer was added
along with 1 unit RNase H and 30 units DNA polymerase I.
The reaction volume was increased to 100 ll with water.
All components were added cold and the second strand
synthesis reaction was carried out at 15C for 2 h. Double
stranded cDNA was puriﬁed with the QIAquick PCR
puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen, Germany) and subsequently used
as input for massive parallel pyrosequencing.
Massive parallel pyrosequencing and data analysis
The cDNA samples were analyzed by massive parallel
pyrosequencing using a Genome Sequencer GS20
sequencing platform (Roche Applied Science). First, 6 lg
of each sample was subjected to nebulisation. Further
library preparation was performed according to the stan-
dard GS20 library preparation protocol as supplied by
Roche Applied Bioscience. Emulsion PCR and bead
enrichment were carried out according to the standard
GS20 protocol. One full picotiterplate (PTP; 70 9 75 mm)
with two regions was used. Enriched beads were divided
over both regions. Sequencing was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science).
GS20 data processing was performed on-rig using the
standard GS software, resulting in an average read length
of 89.7 nt, a total number of raw reads of 768,329 and a
total number of Passed Filter reads 377,673.
ThePassedFilterreads(377,673ESTs)werecleanedfrom
low quality regions using SeqClean (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/
tgi/software/).Foursequencesshorterthan40nucleotidesand
422 sequences that consisted mostly of low-complexity suc-
cessions were discarded. The resulting 377,447 high quality
sequenceswereanalyzedusingtheTGIClustering(TGICL),a
software system for fast clustering of large EST datasets
(http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/software/). The parameters used
forclusteringallowedtogroupsequencessharingaminimum
of 95% identity over at least 40 nucleotides with less than 10
bases of mismatched sequence at either end (Quackenbush
et al. 2000). Initially the reads were searched for redundant
sequences and after the megablast of the TGICL, one cluster
with in total 77,050 ESTs was discharged. The reads of this
cluster showed high similarity to chloroplast sequences.
Computationallimitationsdidnotallowforcontigbuildingof
a cluster with this redundancy. The resulting sequences were
searched for repeats using the dicots repeat databases avail-
ableathttp://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/plant.repeats/.However,
thetrichome-derivedESTsdidnotshowsigniﬁcantsimilarity
to these repeats, and the repeat masking step of the unigene
creationwasomitted.Asecondcycleofunigenecreationwas
performed using the output of the ﬁrst cycle as input. This
process created a set of merged contigs constructed by
merging less than 5% of the unigenes from the ﬁrst run of
TGICL. A third cycle of unigene creation did not result in
additional merges. The output of the second cycle contained
18,918unigeneswith2ormoreESTsperunigeneand42,601
singlets.
cDNA library construction and isolation of full length
cDNAs of terpene synthases
cDNA libraries were constructed using the HybriZAP -2.1
XR library construction kit and HybriZAP -2.1 XR cDNA
Plant Mol Biol (2011) 77:323–336 325
123synthesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, Texas, USA).
The size of the primary cDNA library was 3.0 9 10
6 pfu
for S. lycopersicum and 9.9 9 10
6 for S. habrochaites. The
primary libraries were ampliﬁed according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The ampliﬁed cDNA libraries were
excised using the Mass Excision Protocol described by the
manufacturer. Excised cDNA libraries were used to PCR
amplify 30 and 50 fragments of cDNAs of interest identiﬁed
previously in the pyrosequencing database. When neces-
sary, re-ampliﬁcation was performed using nested primers.
After sequence veriﬁcation, the resulting full length can-
didate-sesquiterpene synthases were cloned in-frame into
the pGEX-KG expression vector (Guan and Dixon 1991).
In addition to the cDNAs from S. habrochaites accession
PI127826 as described above, we obtained cDNAs from a
different S. habrochaites accession (PI126449) using a
published EST database (Fridman et al. 2005). Sequence
data can be found in the GenBank database (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) under accession numbers: ShTPS9,
JN402388; ShTPS12, JN402389; ShTPS14a, JN402390;
ShTPS17, JN402391; ShTPS14b, JN402392; ShTPS15b,

Functional expression analysis
Expression constructs were transformed to C41 (DE3)
electro competent E. coli cells (Dumon-Seignovert et al.
2004). From a single colony an overnight culture was
grown at 37C of which 500 ll was inoculated in 50 ml
Terriﬁc Broth containing 100 lgm l
-1 ampicillin. The
culture was grown to an OD600 of 0.5–0.6 at 37C after
which they were placed at 4C for 30 min. Protein
expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thio-
galactopyranoside (IPTG; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). An
empty plasmid was taken along as a negative control. After
incubation for 16 h at 16C at 200 rpm, cells were har-
vested by centrifugation at 4,500 rpm at 4C for 15 min.
The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resus-
pended in 2 ml of assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2,
10 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with added lysozyme
(1 mg ml
-1) and protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-
free; Roche, Basel Switzerland). Cells were incubated on
ice for 30 min after which they were sonicated. Lysates
were centrifuged at 4C for 25 min at 12,000 g. The
supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80C.
Activity assays were performed in 20 ml glass vials in a
total volume of 500 ll containing 50 mM HEPES, pH7.2,
100 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2,2 0lM MgCl2, 5% (v/v)
glycerol, 5 mM DTT with 50 ll protein extract and either
2m M ( E,E)-FPP (E–E-farnesyl diphosphate), (Z,Z)-FPP
(2Z-6Z-farnesyl diphosphate) or GPP (geranyl diphosphate)
as substrate (Echelon Biosciences Incorporated, Salt Lake
City, USA). Vials were immediately closed with a Teﬂon
lined crimp cap and incubated under moderate shaking for
1 h at 30C. Enzyme products were sampled with a Solid
Phase Micro Extraction ﬁber (SPME) for 10 min after the
vial had been agitated and heated to 50C. The ﬁber was
desorbed for 1 min in an Optic injector port (ATAS GL Int.
Zoeterwoude, NL) which was kept at 250C. Compounds
were separated on a DB-5 column (10 m 9 180 lm,
0.18 lm ﬁlm thickness; Hewlett Packard) in an 6890 N gas
chromatograph (Agilent, Amstelveen, NL) with a temper-
ature program set to 40C for 1.5 min, ramp to 250Ca t
30C per minute and 250C for an additional 2.5 min.
Helium was used as a carrier gas, the column ﬂow set to
3 ml per minute for 2 min, and to 1.5 ml per minute
thereafter. Mass spectra were generated with the ion source
set to -70 V at 200C and collected with a Time-of-Flight
MS (Leco, Pegasus III, St. Joseph, MI, USA) at 1,850 V,
with an acquisition rate of 20 scans per second. Because
some terpenes, such as germacrenes, are prone to thermal
conversion (Colby et al. 1998; Faraldos et al. 2007) the
enzyme assays were also extracted with pentane which was
injected at 50C in the injection port. For this, 500 ll lysate
was assayed in the presence of 5 mM DTT and either
(E,E)-FPP, (Z,Z)-FPP or GPP as a substrate, overlaid with
2 ml pentane (Sigma). After 1 h of incubation at 30C the
pentane layer was transferred to a 2 ml glass vial and
concentrated on ice under nitrogen gas, to a ﬁnal volume of
50 ll. Terpenoids were analysed by injection of 2 ll into
the Optic injection port (ATAS GL international) at 50C,
subsequently heated to 275C at a rate of 4Cs
-1 followed
by gas-chromatography and mass-spectrometry as descri-
bed by Bleeker et al. (2009). Boiled protein extract could
not convert any of the precursors and was taken along as a
negative control. No products were formed with GGPP as
substrate. Terpene products were identiﬁed using standards
when possible or by comparing mass spectra, and Kovats
Index (Adams 2002).
The enzymatic assays for ShTPS15 from PI126449 and
SlTPS31 from cultivar M82 and the analyses of their
products were performed as described in Falara et al. (in
press).
Expression analysis
RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, from different
tissues of 4-week-old S. lycopersicum plants. RNA was
isolated from leaves, whole stem (stem pieces with tric-
homes), bald stem (stem pieces with trichomes removed),
stem trichomes, root, fruit and ﬂowers. Additionally, RNA
was isolated from stem trichomes of 4-week-old S. lyco-
persicum plants 24 h after spraying with either 1 mM
326 Plant Mol Biol (2011) 77:323–336
123jasmonic acid (Ducheva Biochemicals) in tap water con-
taining 0.05% SilwetL-77, or water and SilwetL-77 alone.
The RNA was DNase treated (TURBO DNase kit,
Ambion) and the quantity determined with a Nanodrop
spectrofotometer (ND-1000, Thermo Scientiﬁc). First
strand cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 lg of total RNA
using the RevertAid kit from Fermentas according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. For expression analysis the
cDNA equivalent of 100 ng RNA was used as template
with the SYBR Green PCR qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invit-
rogen) and 300 nM of each primer and dispersed as 20 ll
on a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems).
PCRs were performed in the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). The speciﬁcity of the reac-
tion was veriﬁed by dissociation analysis. Expression of
ACTIN (SGN-U579547) was used to normalize and correct
for variance in quality of RNA and quantity of input
cDNA. Primer pair efﬁciencies were estimated by analysis
of ampliﬁcation curves of a standard cDNA dilution range.
Three biological replicates were analyzed individually and
statistical signiﬁcance was tested by ANOVA.
Results
Sequences of sesquiterpene synthases from Solanum
lycopersicum and Solanum habrochaites show high
levels of identity
Massive parallel pyrosequencing of the trichome transcript-
omes resulted in 195,377 reads from cDNA derived from
S. lycopersicum and 182,386 reads from S. habrochaites
accession PI127826, both with an average length of 80
nucleotides. About 0.20% of all reads had high sequence
similarity to known sesquiterpene synthases for S. lycopersi-
cum versus 0.12% for S. habrochaites reads (Table 1). This
resulted in the identiﬁcation of multiple TPS sequences
belonging to the TPS-a clade according to the phylogeny of
theplantTPSfamily(Bohlmannetal.1998;Chenetal.2011).
Recently we have analyzed the nearly completed genomic
sequence of S. lycopersicum, and have identiﬁed a total of 44
TPS genes (Falara et al. in press). This analysis also showed
thatthemajorityofTPSgenesinthetomatogenomeappearto
encode sesquiterpene synthases and most of these putative
sesquiterpene synthases belong to the TPS-a clade. In the
S. lycopersicum database, transcripts for TPS9 (previously
shown to encode germacrene C synthase; van Der Hoeven
et al. 2000), TPS12 (previously shown to encode b-caryo-
phyllene/a-humulene synthase; van Der Hoeven et al. 2000),
TPS15, TPS16 and TPS17 were identiﬁed, as well as low
numbers of reads for TPS31 (TPS31 was formerly known as
LeVS2 (GenBank: AAG09949.1), but the function of LeVS2
wasnotestablished).Itwasnotedthatthefull-lengthcDNAof
TPS15hasaprematurestopatposition228andispredictedto
encode a non-functional protein of 76 amino acids.
Multiple putative sesquiterpene synthases from S. hab-
rochaites accession PI127826 were also observed, and full-
length cDNAs for these genes were isolated. Based on
phylogenetic analysis of their DNA sequences (Fig. 1),
these cDNAs came from the TPS9, TPS12, TPS15, and
TPS17. Again, TPS15 had several premature stop codons
in the 50 region of the cDNA but could putatively encode a
shorter protein of 499 amino acids if the ATG at position
157 is functional as start codon, albeit this protein is
unlikely to have sesquiterpene synthase activity. We were
able to use the primers for S. lycopersicum TPS16 to
amplify the S. habrochaites TPS16 cDNA as well. How-
ever, the ShTPS16 cDNA contained a single nucleotide
deletion at position 459, a mutation that results in a pre-
mature stop at amino acid 153, thus ShTPS16 is predicted
to encode a non-functional enzyme.
Searching the trichome EST database of S. habrochaites
accession PI126449, a line whose trichomes contain high
levels of methylketones but also some sesquiterpenes (Frid-
manetal.2005),identiﬁedasequenceintheTPS-acladewith
high similarity to SlTPS15 (Suppl. Fig. 1) and additionally a
sequence with high similarity to SlTPS14 (Falara et al. in
press). The full-length cDNA of the ShTPS15 had an open
readingframeof540codonswithoutanyapparentmutations.
Apart from the sequence of TPS14 from S. lycopersicum,
expressedprimarilyinroots(Fig. 7),wewereabletoisolatea
full-length cDNA of ShTPS14 from stem trichomes of
accession PI127826 and ﬂowers of accession PI126449.
These two ShTPS14 cDNAs had an open reading frame
putatively encoding proteins of 554 amino acids.
Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) of the newly identiﬁed
and previously characterized tomato TPSs shows that
SlTPS9 clusters together with previously identiﬁed ger-
macrene synthases from cultivated tomatoes (SlVFNT,
SSTLE1, SSTLE2) and ShTPS9 with germacrene syn-
thases from S. habrochaites accession LA1777 (SSTLH1
and SSTLH2). It also indicates that each TPS from

123S. lycopersicum has a higher similarity to its respective
ortholog in S. habrochaites accession PI127826 than to
other tomato TPSs. Both monoterpene synthases TPS5 and
TPS4 (formerly MTS1 and 2; van Schie et al. 2007) cluster
together in the phylogenetic tree, as well as santalene/
bergamotene (sesquiterpene) synthase (ShSBS) from
S. habrochaites, which accepts (Z,Z)-FPP as a substrate
(Sallaud et al. 2009), and phellandrene (monoterpene)
synthase (TPS20, formerly SlPHS1) from cultivated
tomato, which mainly uses NPP as substrate (Schilmiller
et al. 2009). The relationships between the different TPSs
were conﬁrmed by a phylogenetic tree based on the amino
acid sequences (Suppl. Fig. 2). Alignment of the deduced
amino acid sequences of TPS9, TPS12, TPS16 and TPS17,
depicted in Supplemental ﬁgure 3, shows how closely
related TPS9 and TPS12, and TPS16 and TPS17, respec-
tively, are. All proteins contained the RR/P8xW motive
found in most terpene synthases, which is involved in
hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate group and the DDxxD
motive, involved in cofactor binding.
Enzymatic activity of recombinant sesquiterpene
synthases
Proteins isolated from E. coli cells expressing the putative
sesquiterpene synthases were assayed for their ability to
convert (E,E)-FPP into sesquiterpenes. The protein enco-
ded by the Moneymaker allele of SlTPS9 produced ger-
macrene C, and minor amounts of germacrene A, B and D
(Fig. 2a), similar to the protein encoded by this locus in
cultivar VFNT Cherry tomato. ShTPS9 catalyzed the for-
mation of mostly germacrene B and minor amounts of A
and C (Fig. 2b), similar to the products observed in the
reaction catalyzed by a very similar protein, designated
SSTLH1 encoded by a cDNA isolated from S. habrocha-
ites accession LA1777 (van Der Hoeven et al. 2000). Both

123recombinant TPS12 proteins had b-caryophyllene/a-
humulene synthase activity (Fig. 3a, b).
SlTPS17 and ShTPS17, which are 98.6% identical and
99.1% similar on the protein level, produced both mostly
valencene from (E,E)-FPP and also an unidentiﬁed ses-
quiterpene, besides azulene and a- and b-farnesenes
(SlTPS17; Fig. 3c) or b-farnesene (ShTPS17; Fig. 3d). As
predicted, SlTPS15 and ShTPS15 from accession PI127826
had no activity, but the ShTPS15 allele isolated from
accession PI126449 encoded a protein that catalyzed the
formation of mostly germacrene A (Fig. 4). We were
unable to detect activity of SlTPS16 although a soluble
protein of the correct size was expressed in E. coli upon
IPTG induction (data not shown). Remarkably, all recom-
binant proteins that could use (E,E)-FPP as substrate could
also use (Z,Z)-FPP as substrate (Suppl. Fig. 4). SlTPS9
made mostly germacrene C from both (E,E)-FPP as well as
(Z,Z)-FPP whereas ShTPS9 produced germacrene B and
a-humulene with (Z,Z)-FPP (Suppl. Fig. 4a,b). SlTPS12
and ShTPS12 both made curcumene and b-bisabolene from
(Z,Z)-FPP (Suppl. Fig. 4c,d). SlTPS17 and ShTPS17 made
various bisabolenes when activity assays were done with
(Z,Z)-FPP (Suppl. Fig. 4e,f).
Although the TPS14 proteins only differ in a few amino
acids from each other (Suppl. Fig. 5), their capacity to use
(Z,Z)- or (E,E)-FPP as substrate differed substantially.
SlTPS14 could use either (E,E)-FPP or (Z,Z)-FPP equally
well to make mostly (Z)-c-bisabolene or a-bisabolene,
respectively (Falara et al. in press). Interestingly, ShTPS14
from PI126449 appears to have no clear preference for
either (Z,Z)-FPP or (E,E)-FPP. In the presence of (Z,Z)-FPP
the enzyme made predominantly (Z)-b-farnesene, a- and
b-acoradiene and a- and c-bisabolenes, while when assayed
with (E,E)-FPP a-cederene, (Z)-thujopsene, b-farnesene,
b-acoradiene and b-bisabolene were produced (Fig. 5).
ShTPS14 from PI127826 on the other hand clearly favored
(E,E)-FPP to synthesize b-farnesene and a- and b-bisabo-
lene (Fig. 5a, b). SlTPS31 predominantly made viridiﬂo-
rene from (E,E)-FPP (Fig. 6).

Expression of S. lycopersicum sesquiterpene synthases
is differentially regulated
To investigate in which tissues the active S. lycopersicum
sesquiterpene synthases TPS9, TPS12, TPS14, TPS17 and
TPS31 were transcribed, we dissected mature S. lycoper-
sicum plants for RNA isolation and subsequent quantitative
RT-PCR. Expression of all terpene synthases was lowest in
fruits (Fig. 7). TPS9 and TPS17 displayed similar expres-
sion patterns, with highest expression in stem trichomes
(Fig. 7a, d). TPS12 expression was highest in leaves
(Fig. 7b), most likely in the leaf trichomes as shown for
SlTPS12 in the cultivar M82 (Schilmiller et al. 2010). In
S. lycopersicum, TPS14 is expressed mostly in the roots
(Fig. 7c), while in the S. habrochaites accession PI127826
TPS14 transcripts were found in trichomes (data not
shown). Expression of TPS31 was very low overall, but
highest in stem trichomes and leaves (Fig. 7e), most likely
in their trichomes.
Differential expression in response to jasmonate
treatment
Since jasmonic acid (JA) treatment resulted in the induc-
tion of SlMTS1 (SlTPS3) in stem trichomes (van Schie
et al. 2007), we tested whether expression of SlTPS9,
SlTPS12, SlTPS17 or SlTPS31 was induced by JA treat-
ment. Moneymaker plants that were 4 weeks old were
treated with 1 mM JA or left untreated as a control, RNA
was isolated after 24 h, and the levels of transcripts were
measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 8). Only the trichome-speciﬁc
expression of SlTPS31 was signiﬁcantly induced, approx-
imately threefold by JA treatment, just as the positive
control SlMTS1 (SlTPS3, data not shown). Interestingly,
expression of SlTPS17 appeared to be reduced roughly
twofold in JA-treated plants (P = 0.059).
Discussion
Large scale transcript sequencing as tool for gene
discovery
The presence and biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes in S. ly-
copersicum and S. habrochaites had been previously
investigated (Colby et al. 1998; Schilmiller et al. 2010; van
Der Hoeven et al. 2000). Colby et al. (1998) isolated a
cDNA from the cultivar VNFT Cherry and showed that it
encodes germacrene C and van der Hoeven et al. (2000)
showed that synthesis of germacrene C, b-caryophyllene
and a-humulene was controlled by a locus on chromosome

1236. Using the VFNT cDNA of germacrene C as a probe to
screen cDNA libraries, van der Hoeven et al. (2000) also
isolated two cDNAs, designated SSTLE1 and SSTLE2,
that were very similar to VNFT germacrene C. Based on
the sequences of both cDNAs, we can conclude that they
are different alleles (or one of them may be a cloning
artifact) of SlTPS9, which we now know to be located on
chromosome 6 (Falara et al. in press). Van der Hoeven
et al. (2000) also identiﬁed two alleles of TPS9 from
S. habroachaites accession LA1777, designated SSTLH1
and SSTLH2, whose cDNAs encode germacrene B and
germacrene D, respectively.
Subsequently, Schilmiller et al. (2010), using a proteo-
mic approach, identiﬁed a protein sequence in S. lycoper-
sicum cv. M82 trichomes that catalyzed the formation of
b-caryophyllene and a-humulene, and was therefore des-
ignated as CAHS (b-caryophyllene/a-humulene synthase).
Our data indicate that TPS12 encodes CASH. Here we used
massive parallel pyrosequencing as an approach for terpene
synthase transcript discovery in a specialized tissue type
enriched for plant secondary metabolites, the trichomes of

123wild and cultivated tomato plants. Using this approach, we
were able to identify transcripts of not only TPS9 and
TPS12 but also of TPS14, TPS15, TPS16, TPS17 and
TPS31 in the trichomes of S. lycopersicum, S. habrocha-
ites, or both.
Over representation of germacrene synthases
Germacrene synthases have been isolated from species
such as poplar (Arimura et al. 2004), goldenrod (Prosser
et al. 2004), kiwi fruit (Nieuwenhuizen et al. 2009), melon
(Portnoy et al. 2008), Cistus creticus (Falara et al. 2008)
and many others. Often when a gene discovery approach is
used to ﬁnd new terpene synthases, in vitro functional
assays show that multiple genes in a species encode ger-
macrene synthases. For example, a degenerate primer
strategy to ﬁnd sesquiterpenes in lettuce resulted in the
identiﬁcation of only two germacrene A synthases (Bennett
et al. 2002). Recently ﬁve sesquiterpenes from the fungus
Coprinus cinereus were isolated and two of these recom-
binant sesquiterpene synthases catalyze the formation of
germacrene A (Agger et al. 2009). Similarly, two out of
three characterized sesquiterpene synthases from sunﬂower
were identiﬁed as germacrene A synthases (Gopfert et al.
2009). The observation that three of the sesquiterpene
synthases from tomato that we and others have character-
ized—SlTPS9 and ShTPS9, and ShTPS15 from accession
PI126449—produce germacrenes with FPP as the in vitro
substrate is remarkable, since only minor amounts of vol-
atile germacrenes are present in trichomes (Kang et al.
2010; Paetzold et al. 2010; van Der Hoeven et al. 2000)o r
emitted from tomato (Ament et al. 2004; Kant et al. 2004).
It has been postulated that germacrene A is an intermediate
in epi-aristolochene synthase catalysed by tobacco 5-epi-
aristolochene synthase (Rising et al. 2000). Moreover,
certain sesquiterpenes in Medicago trunculata were proven
to be generated predominantly via protonation of the neu-
tral intermediate, germacrene D, as opposed to synthesis
directly via FPP isomerization to nerolidyl diphosphate
(Garms et al. 2010). Likewise, Selina-3,7(11)-diene
(Table 2) is the result of a C6 protonation of germacrene B
(Davis and Croteau 2000). Germacrene A can also be
derivatized by other enzymes as is suggested for germac-
rene A from lettuce (Bennett et al. 2002). Therefore, in
planta assays are necessary to determine whether these
enzymes are bona ﬁde germacrene synthases.
All sesquiterpene synthases accepted both (E,E)-FPP
and (Z,Z)-FPP as substrates
TPS14 synthases from both S. habrochaites accessions
catalyzed the formation of multiple terpenes from (E,E)-
FPP and (Z,Z)-FPP, including farnesenes, acoradienes and
a variety of bisabolenes (Fig. 5). However, it appears that
TPS14 from accession PI127826 exhibited a preference for
the (cytosolic) (E,E) isoform of FPP, whereas intriguingly,
the TPS14 from accession PI126449 appeared to have an
equally high afﬁnity for (Z,Z)-FPP instead. When each
ShTPS14 was assayed with both FPP-isomers present,
compounds derived from both isomers were identiﬁed for
ShTPS14 PI126449 whereas the ShTPS14 PI127826
products were identical to the ones seen when the enzyme
was incubated with (E,E)-FPP alone (data not shown). In
S. lycopersicum, TPS14 accepted (E,E)-FPP and (Z,Z)-FPP
equally well, producing mostly b-bisabolene and a-bisab-
olene, respectively (Falara et al. in press).
ShTPS14 makes multiple products, ((E)-a-bisabolene,
c-bisabolenes and b-bisabolenes and b-farnesenes; Fig. 5)
which, most likely, are direct products of deprotonation of
the bisabolyl cation (C6-ring) formed from FPP via ner-
olidol diphosphate, without other intermediates (Davis and
Croteau 2000). Interestingly, the TPS14 proteins appear to
contain two aspartate-rich DDxxD Mg
2?-binding motifs
(305 and 527; Suppl. Fig. 5) as well as a ‘protonation-
initiated’ mechanism catalytic DxDD motif (in ShTPS14)
(104; Suppl. Fig. 5), both of which are common in di-and
tri-terpene cyclases. The presence of a second DDxxD
motif could be responsible for alternate orientations of the
substrate and therefore synthesis of multiple products
(Davis and Croteau 2000). TPS9, 12 and 17 also accepted
(Z,Z)-FPP as substrate (Suppl. Fig. 4). Our observations of
sesquiterpene synthases reacting with substrates other than
the canonical (E,E)-FPP adds additional weight to previous
intimations of the ﬂexibility of these enzymes. For exam-
ple, Jones et al. (2011) reported a cytosolic sequiterpene
synthase from sandalwood able to use both (E,E) and (Z,Z)
isomers of FPP to produce similar compounds. Such
observations from multiple species suggest that these
properties of the enzyme are not in vitro artifacts but might
have in vivo relevance. However, whether (Z,Z)-FPP is
available in the cytosol of the Solanum trichomes is not
yet known, although evidence has been presented that
S. habrochaites accession LA1777 produces (Z,Z)-FPP in
the plastids (Sallaud et al. 2009).
Albeit with low efﬁciency, all TPSs described here were
able to convert GPP to (mono) terpene products (Suppl.
Fig. 6) indicating a level of plasticity of the active pocket
of the protein. While some sesquiterpene synthases that are
restricted to the use of a single substrate even with regard
to precursors of the same size ((E,E)-FPP or (Z,Z)-FPP;
Besser et al. 2009), there are examples of terpene synthases
that can accommodate both GPP as well as (E,E)-FPP in a
productive manner (van Schie et al. 2007) or even GGPP as
a third possible substrate (Martin et al. 2010; Arimura et al.
2008). It has been proposed that trace amounts of GPP are
present in the cytosol, and minor amounts of (E,E)-FPP are
332 Plant Mol Biol (2011) 77:323–336
123available to plastid-localised terpene synthases (Aharoni
et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006). Hence, the active site plasticity
of some TPS to accommodate isoprenyl diphosphates of
different chain length may be biologically relevant.
Correlations between TPS transcript abundance, TPS
products and sesquiterpene production in trichomes
Despite the fact that monoterpenes appear to dominate
S. lycopersicum volatile emissions (Buttery et al. 1987;
Bleeker et al. 2009), the majority of TPS genes mined from
the tomato genome are sesquiterpene synthases (Falara
et al. in press). Based on the in vitro functional charac-
terization of the group of sesquiterpene synthases whose
transcripts we detected in stem trichomes in S. lycopersi-
cum and S. habrochaites, the presence of most, but not all
of the sesquiterpenes observed in the respective glands can
be explained (Table 2). Most notably, we did not ﬁnd any
terpene synthase that could produce zingiberene, the most
abundant sesquiterpene in S. habrochaites PI127826
(Bleeker et al. 2009). Also, trichomes of S. lycopersicum
contain, albeit at minor amounts, the sesquiterpenes
a-copaene and cuparene that are unaccounted for in the
SlTPS enzymes assayed here.
Since some sesquiterpenes are made by more than one
sesquiterpene synthases in the same species, it is difﬁcult to
determine the direct contribution of each of them to the
observed mixture even when the expression levels of
individual sesquiterpene synthases are examined in detail.
Because we used non-normalized cDNAs in the RNA-seq
experiments, we were able to analyze the data output for
comparison of transcript levels of the different genes
between S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites, and the
results indicate that overall abundance of sesquiterpene
synthase transcripts did not correlate with the total amount
of emitted sesquiterpenes, as S. habrochaites PI127826
emits over 50 lgg
-1 FW sesquiterpenes in 24 h (Bleeker
et al. 2009) whereas S. lycopersicum plants only emits 0.7
lg sesquiterpenes g
-1 FW per day and total read abun-
dance in the RNA-seq was 240 versus 383 respectively
(Table 1). Although transcript abundance need not be
translated into protein abundance, another explanation for
the low sesquiterpene content of S. lycopersicum might be
found in low precursor biosynthesis. Quantitative RT-PCR
on cDNA derived from stem trichomes of S. lycopersicum
and S. habrochaites LA1777 showed that expression of
HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the MEP pathway,
is approx. sevenfold higher in S. habrochaites (Besser et al.
2009). Our own RNA-seq data also show that transcript
levels of HMG-CoA reductase are much higher (180 reads)
in S. habrochaites than in S. lycopersicum (24 reads). It is
possible that the in planta function of terpene synthases
may differ from the in vivo function we found in our
enzymatic assays though a more likely explanation for the
discrepancy between the total sesquiterpene emission and
the level of expression of synthases found might be that we
have not annotated all sesquiterpene sythase sequences in
our dataset. In this study we have conﬁned our analysis of
sesquiterpene biosynthesis to sesquiterpene synthases that
belong to the TPS-a clade and have no plastid-targeting
transit sequences. In S. habrochaites accession LA1777, a
member of the TPS-e/f clade designated SBS is known to
be localized in the plastid and to catalyze the formation of
the sesquiterpenes santalene and bergamotene synthase
from (Z,Z)-FPP (Sallaud et al. 2009), and although our
RNA-seq database contains sequences that are highly
similar to SBS, we did not characterize them further.
In addition to divergence in the enzymatic properties of
S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites alleles of respective
TPS genes described above, the two species also differ in
the set of sesquiterpene synthase genes that are expressed
in their trichomes. For example, TPS14 is expressed in
S. habrochaites trichomes but not in the S. lycopersicum
trichomes, whereas TPS31 is expressed in the latter but not
in the former, although in both cases the expression of
these genes was relatively low. Thus, we can conclude that
the differences in the repertoire of sesquiterpenes produced
in these two Solanum species is due both to evolution of
enzymatic activity and regulation of gene expression.
Finally, we were also able to show that the major product
of SlTPS17 and ShTPS17 is valencene (Fig. 3). This
compound is detected in S. habrochaites trichomes, but not

product of SlTPS31, viridiﬂorene (Fig. 6), we could not
detect in trichomes of either species (Table 2).
In conclusion, our RNAseq approach has allowed us to
identify sesquiterpene synthases that are expressed in stem
trichomes of cultivated and wild tomato species. Some of
these genes are also expressed elsewhere in the plant, but
others appear to be speciﬁcally expressed or highly enri-
ched in stem trichomes. The analysis of the enzymatic
activity of orthologs revealed that in some case different
products are made by orthologous sesquiterpene synthases
and that some orthologs differ in their substrate preference.
These results provide new tools to study the evolution of
terpene synthase activity at the level of protein structure.
