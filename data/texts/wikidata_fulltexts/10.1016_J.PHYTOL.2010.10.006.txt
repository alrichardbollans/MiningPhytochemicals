From a MeOH extract of Lunasia amara, which showed the cytochrome P450 2D6 
(CYP2D6) inhibition, 14 acridone alkaloids including two new alkaloids [5-
hydoroxygraveoline (1) and 8-methoxyifflaiamine (2)] were identified. Among the 14 
acridone alkaloids, 5-hydoroxygraveoline (1) and lunamarine (3) showed moderate 
inhibition selective for CYP2D6, with IC50 values of 4.7 µM and 1.8 µM, respectively.
