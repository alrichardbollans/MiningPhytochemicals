It is known as amapa or amapazeiroand the bark and latex are used by the natives as a tonic andanti-syphilis medicine1. The previous and only paperinvolving the phytochemical study of this species reportedthe presence of friedelin, lupeol, b-amyrin, a-amyrin andtheir acetyl derivatives, four 3b-O-acyl lupeol, two 3b-O-3-hydroxiacyl lupeol and two 3b-O-3,5-di hydroxyacyllupeol in the bark and latex. Furthermore, triterpene fattyacid esters were also identified in plants2,3.In this paper we report the occurrence of all thecompounds above in the roots of this species, along withthe known steroids b-sitosterol, stigmasterol andb-sitosterone and nine new 3b-O-acyl lupeol esters. Thestructures of these compounds were established byspectroscopic data, mainly 1H and 13C (HBBD and DEPT)NMR spectra. The methyl esters obtained by hydrolysis ofacyl lupeol esters and methylation of the corresponding acidswere characterized by MS-GC.ExperimentalGeneral experimental proceduresMelting points are uncorrected. The 1H and 13C NMRspectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 spectrometer (1H:400 MHz, 13C: 100 MHz), and a Bruker Ac-200 (1H: 200 MHz,13C: 50.3 MHz) using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internalstandard. The MS-GC analyses were carried out with aShimadzu QP 2000A, EI 70eV, with hyperbolic quadrupoleusing split mode (1:10), source temp. 250oC, column DB1(50 m x 0.25 mm I.D. x 0.33 mm film thichness), initial temp100oC/30oC min-1/200oC/10oC min-1/300oC. Column flow1.65 mL min-1 and carrier gas Hellium. CHCl3 was used assolvent. FT-IR spectra were recorded in KBr discs on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 spectrometer. Chromatography was performedusing silica gel (Merck and Aldrich) for column and preparativeTLC. The purity of the compounds was checked by 1H and13C NMR spectral analysis and TLC plate, developed withUV (254 and 366 nm) and exposure to iodine vapour.*e-mail: mgeraldo@ufrrj.br.J. Braz. Chem.

The voucher specimen (nb 07231) is deposited in theHerbário Amapaense (HAMAB) of the Divisão de Botânicado Museu Ângelo Moreira da Costa Lima, Instituto de Estudose Pesquisas do Amapá (IEPA), Macapá-AP, Brasil.Extraction and isolation of constituentsThe pulverized bark (470 g) and wood (800 g) fromroots were extracted by maceration with hexane andmethanol at room temperature. The solutions obtained wereconcentrated under vacuum to afford the residues PACRH(11.1 g, from the bark) and PARH (55.4 g, from the wood)from hexane and PACRM (8.0 g, from the bark) andPARM (30.0 g, from the wood) from methanol extracts.Both methanol residues were analyzed by IR and 1H and13C NMR spectra that revealed the presence of acarbohydrate mixture. A part of the residue PARH wasrecrystallized from hexane:AcOEt to yield two fractionsPARH-1 (20.0 mg) and PARH-2 (30.0 mg), which wereexamined by both TLC (hexane-EtOAc, 9:1) andspectrometric analysis to reveal the presence of a mixtureof b -sitosterol and stigmasterol in PARH-1 and a mixtureof b -sitosterone, lupeol, b -amyrin and a -amyrin in PARH-2.The PACRH residue was recrystallized from acetone toyield PACRH-1 and PACRH-2. TLC and spectrometricanalysis showed the presence of a mixture of the lupeol,b -amyrin and a -amyrin acetates in PACRH-1 and amixture of 2 + 3 + 4 in PACRH-2. 80.0 mg of PACRH-2was chromatographed by preparative TLC (hexane-EtOAc,9:1) furnishing 2 (40 mg) and 3 (25 mg).b -Sitosterol and stigmasterolMp 139-141 oC, hexane-EtOAc. These compounds wereidentified by 1H and 13C (HBBD and DEPT) NMR spectralanalysis and by comparison with literature data4,6.b -Sitosterone, lupeol, b -amyrin and a -amyrinMp 152-154 oC, acetone. The presence of these threetriterpenes and of the steroid in a mixture was revealed byspectral data, mainly 13C NMR (HBBD and DEPT) and1H,13C COSY, and by comparison with literature data1,5.The MS-GC analysis of this mixture showed the presenceof two peaks at m/z 426 and 412 corresponding to the M+.of isomeric triterpenes and b -sitost-4-en-3-one,respectively. This steroid was also identified with the helpof a MS/GC library.Acetates of b -amyrin, a -amyrin and lupeol (1)Mp 139-141 oC, acetone. These triterpenes wereidentified by spectral data, mainly 13C NMR (HBBD andDEPT) and comparison with the chemical shifts describedin the literature1,5.Mixture of triterpenoid esters 2 + 3 + 4Mp 58-60 oC, acetone. n max/cm-1 (KBr,), 1H and 13CNMR (CDCl3) were identical to literature values1.Hydrolysis of the esters of the 2+3+4 mixtureThe mixture (100.0 mg) was treated with 20% NaOH inMeOH (5 mL), refluxed for 2 h and extracted with ethyl ether.The solvent was removed by evaporation and the residueobtained was chromatographed on a silica gel column to furnisha mixture of carboxylic acids (43.0 mg, mp 126-128oC). Thismixture (26 mg) was treated with CH2N2 previously preparedfrom Diazald to yield a methyl esters mixture (26.0 mg, mp111-113oC). The mixture of methyl esters was submitted toMS-GC analysis and 2a - 2j, 3a - 3e, 4a e 4b were identified.Acetylation of 340.0 mg of 3 was dissolved in a mixture of pyridineand Ac2O (1:1) and the solution was maintained for 24 hat room temperature. The usual work up and crystallizationfrom methanol yielded 3Ac.(28.0 mg, mp 59-61oC). Thisacetyl derivative was identified by 1H-NMR (200 MHz,CDCl3) and 13C-NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3) spectral data bycomparison with the values described in the literature1.Oxidation of 3Pyridinium chlorochromate suspended in dry CH2Cl2(40%, 7 mL) was added to 40.0 mg of 3 and stirred for 3 h.The black reaction mixture was filtered on a florisil column.The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the 3-oxo product obtained (31.0 mg, mp 57-59oC) wascharacterized as a tautomeric mixture of 5, 6 and 7.1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) d H 0.84 (t, 6.0 Hz, CH3-CH2,5-7), 1.22 [m, (CH2)n, 5-7], 2.49 (t, 6.0 Hz, 2H-4’), 3.40 (s,2H-2’, 5), 4.52 (m, H-3), 4,53 and 4.57 (s, H-29a and H-29b),4.90 (s, H-2’, 6 and 7), together with additional signalscorresponding to lupeol; 13C NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3) d C 202.0(C-3’), 173.5 (C-1’), 82.1 (CH-3) and 49.5 (CH2- 2’) of 5;178.6 (C-3’), 166.9 (C-1’), 89.2 (CH-2’), 82.1 (CH-3), 43.0(CH2- 4’) of 6; 194.9 (C-3’), 172.6 (C-1’), 89.2 (CH-2’), 80.3(CH-3), 43.0 (CH2- 4’) of 7; and additional signalscorresponding to lupeil moiety and a long hydrocarbon chainwhich are in accordance with literature data1.558 Carvalho et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.Results and DiscussionThe known natural products (see experimental) wereidentified by analysis of their 1H and 13C NMR data, MS-GC analysis and comparison with literature data1,4-6.b -sitosterol, stigmasterol and b -sitosterone are beingreported for the first time in this species. Lupeol (1),b -amyrin, a -amyrin and their acetyl derivatives werepreviously isolated from the latex of a specimen ofP. amapa1. From the bark and latex of this specimen esters2E, 2G, 2I, 2J, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E1 were also isolated.In this paper we describe the characterization of thenew triterpenoid esters 2A - 2D, 2F, 2H, 3A, 4A andisolation of 4B from the roots of P. amapa.The presence of these esters (2 - 4) in a mixture wasTable 1.

The mass spectrum of each ofthe 18 intense peaks observed in the gas chromatogram(Table 1) was analyzed. Besides the presence of butylphthalate (X) as a contaminant, ten (2a - 2j) of 2, five (3a- 3e) of 3 and two (4a and 4b) of 4 methyl esters wereidentified. The main peaks observed in the mass spectra ofthe methyl esters [m/z (%): 74 (100) and 87 (65-70) of 2;103 (100) of 3; 97 (70) and 115 (40) of 4] were used tocharacterize the nature of the acyl moieties.

Table 1 shows the retention time (tR)and the relative percentage of each methyl ester identifiedin the mixture. The methyl esters were used to identify theacyllupeol esters 2A - 2J, 3A - 3E, 4A and 4B.A mixture of 2 and 3 was separated by preparative TLCand the acetyl derivative 3Ac was prepared. The 1H and13C (HBBD and DEPT) NMR spectra of this mixture werepractically identical to those of the 3’-acetyl-acyllupeolprepared with the ester isolated from the latex of the samespecies1. Oxidation of 3 with PCC in CH2Cl2 afforded theb -ketoester derivative (3oxo). The 1D 1H and 13C NMR(HBBD and DEPT) and 2D 1H-13C-COSY-nJCH (n = 1,HETECOSY; n = 2 and 3, COLOC) shift-correlated spectraof this product allowed to identify 5 together with the enols6 and 7 (See experimental).AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to CNPq and CAPES for aresearch fellowship and for support from Conselho Nacionalde Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq),Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) and Fundaçãode Amparo ‘a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ).References1.
