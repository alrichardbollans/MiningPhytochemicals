Background: Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) solms is an invasive macrophyte causing serious problems to the network
of irrigation and drainage canals in the Nile Delta region. The present study aim to evaluate the potential
anticancer and antioxidant activities of Eichhornia crassipes crude extract and its pure compounds.
Methods: The macrophyte was collected from El-Zomor canal, River Nile (Egypt), cleaned, air dried, grinded then
extracted with methanol (crude extract). The extract was fractionated using pre-coated silica gel plates (TLC F254)
with hexane/ethyl acetate (8.5: 1.5 v/v) as mobile phase. Nine fractions were separated (A-I) then scratched, eluted
with the same mobile phase, filtered and the separated fractions were determined and identified using spectroscopic
methods (Mass spectrum (MS), Infra red (IR) and Proton H-Nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR). Both the crude
extract and its nine identified compounds were tested for their antioxidant (using 2, 2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH), 2, 2′- azino-bis {ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS.)} methods) and anticancer activity (using MCF-7,
HeLa, Hep.G2 and EACC cell lines).
Results: The antioxidant and anticancer activities of the crude extract exhibited the highest effect while the
compounds showed variable effects which depend on the type of compound and cancer cell line. The antioxidant
activity of the crude extract exhibited the highest followed in descending order by compounds D, E, G and H
respectively. Concerning the anticancer potency, the crude extract showed also the highest effect while the
identified compounds (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I) showed variable anticancer activities against the four different
cell lines. In addition, Compound I exhibited the most potent anticancer activity against HepG2 cell line while
compound D exhibited high anticancer activity against HeLa cells and EACC. The results revealed the presence of
different compounds (Alkaloids and terpenoids) with variable antioxidant and anticancer activities which elicited
an auto-augmentation in the crude extract leading to its greatest activities. The action of the identified anticancer
compounds on DNA fragmentation was studied.
Conclusion: The study illustrated the potential of Eichhornia as a valuable resource for natural compounds of
desirable medicinal properties (e.g. antioxidants and anticancer).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/397Background
The role of plants in maintaining human health is well
documented [1]. Plants are used medicinally in different
countries and are a source of many potent plus powerful
drugs [2]. The active principles of many drugs found in
plants were identified from secondary metabolites [3].
Amongst these active phyto-molecules (at least 12,000)
about only 10% were chemically identified [4]. The medi-
cinally useful bioactive constituents were belonged to alka-
loids, flavonoids, phenolics, essential oils and polyphenols
[5]. Alkaloids were play an important metabolic role and
control development in living systems [6]. These chemical
substances were known to carry out important medicinal
roles in human body. They were also involved in protective
function in animals and used as medicine especially the
steroidal alkaloids [7].
Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) Solms, commonly known
as water hyacinth, is warm aquatic plant belonging to
the family Pontideraceae. Water hyacinth was listed as
one of the most productive plants on earth and consid-
ered the world’s worst aquatic plant [3]. It originated in
the state of Amazone, Brazil, spread to other regions of
South America and was carried by humans to tropical and
subtropical regions. It invaded Africa and causes extremely
serious ecological, economical and social problems in the
region between 40 degree north and 45 degree south [8].
The dense mats of water hyacinth cover lakes and rivers,
blocking water ways and interfering with the water trans-
port of agriculture products, tourism activities and irriga-
tion of agriculture fields. Its vast growth consumes huge
quantity of nutrients favoring and its growth over other
aquatic species [9,10]. Decomposition of dead individuals
released nutrients to water leading to deterioration of water
quality, clean drinking water which threatened human health
[9,10]. In summer season where temperature exceeded 35°C
and high solar radiation with long light duration, Eichhornia
grows faster with rapid spread in the Egyptian water bodies
and serious problems occurred [9,10].
Epidemiological studies reveal that, numbers of diseases
including cancer, diabetes, Alzhimer, coronary heart disease
and aging have been found to be associated with oxidative
stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [11] which dam-
age biomolecules and lead to numerous disease conditions
[12]. Dietary antioxidants may reduce the risks of these
diseases and improve general human health [13,14]. Besides
their effective role in prevention of diseases, antioxidants
were also used as food additives to improve quality of food
products by avoiding offensive flavors [15]. Naturally
produced antioxidants including flavonoids, tannins, cou-
marins, xanthones, phenolics, terpenoids were recorded
in various plant products (fruits, leaves, seeds and oils)
and organisms [9,10].
Recently, considerable attention has been given to har-
vest E. crassipes for practical uses as economical sourcesin many parts of the world. Though, very few pharmaco-
logical studies on this plant have been reported in literature
and are only used as therapeutic properties in folkloric
application [16]. Our previous studies showed promising
antimicrobial and anti-algal activities of water hyacinth ex-
tract and some of its identified compounds [17] encour-
aged us to go further for other biological effects of this
plant. Therefore, the present study aimed to isolate and
evaluate the potentially active substances or fractions with
potential pharmacological activity of water hyacinth. This
investigation was carried out on crude extract of this weed
as well as its fractions for potential anticancer and antioxi-
dant activities. The fractions were chemically identified
and their action on cancer cells was elucidated.
Methods
Chemicals and drugs
Pure hexane, chloroform, ethanol, ether, acetone,
methanol and acetic acid were purchased from E.
Merck Co. (Darmstadt, Germany). Sulfarhodamine, 2,
2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2′- azino-bis
(ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS.+) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Trichloroacetic acid and other materials were of the
highest available commercial grade.
Collection and extraction of water hyacinth
E. crassipes (Mart) Solms was collected during spring
season (2010) from the River Nile at El-Zomor canal
(Giza), Egypt and was identified by Dr. Sanaa M. M.
Shanab, Professor of Phycology, Botany and Microbiology
Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University. This
species has been deposited in a scientifically available
herbarium (Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty
of Science, Cairo University).
It was cleaned from any debris, washed several times
with tap and distilled water then with sterilized water.
The samples were air dried (and/or lyophilized), grinded
and then stored at -20°C until use. A known weight (500 g)
of the macrophyte was extracted three times (Using 5 liter
solvents with 24 h intervals) with methanol at 25°C in the
dark. The solvent of the combined extracts was evaporated,
and solids concentrated using rotary evaporator at 40°C
and weighted.
Fractionation of the crude extract
Using pre-coated TLC F254 plates, a solution of the crude
methanolic extract (Ten grams) containing a mixture of
compounds is applied to the layer of adsorbent, near one
edge, as a thin line. The TLC plate is dropped vertically in
a closed container (developing chamber), with the edge to
which the spot was applied down. The solvents mixture,
which is in the bottom of the container, travels up the
layer of adsorbent by capillary action, passes over the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/397spot and, as it continues up, crude extract was fractionated
using different solvent systems as mobile phase and the
suitable one was selected (hexane/ethyl acetate). In this
concern, different combinations of hexane/ethyl acetate
solvents (9:1, 8.5:1.5, 8:2, 7:3 and 5:5) as the mobile
phase were prepared and tested. The compounds were
moved using hexane/ethyl acetate (8.5:1.5, v/v), as the
best solvent The separated nine fractions (A-I) by the
mixture, were scratched and eluted with the same mo-
bile phase then filtered, evaporated (using nitrogen gas),
weighed and used for chemical identification and in
bioassays experiments [17].
Instrumental analysis
Potent fractions were chosen for further identifications
using the chromatographic and spectroscopic methods
as follows:
a- Mass spectroscopic (MS) analyses of potent
fractions
The biologically potent fractions of E. crassipes were
analyzed by Mass spectra (MS). The mass spectrum
was scanned over the 40 to 500 m/z range with an
ionizing voltage of 70 eV and identification was
based on standard mass library of National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST Version 2.0) to
detect the possible fraction structure.
b- Fourier transformed infra red (FTIR) spectra
A Perkin Elmer (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA)
was used to obtain Fourier transformed infrared
(FTIR) spectra (System, 2000) of the fractions.
c- Proton nuclear magnetic resonance Spectra
(1H NMR)
The identification of fractionated compounds was
confirmed by carrying out 1H-NMR analysis using
NMR Joel GIM, EX 270 (400 Hz).
Assessment of antioxidant activity
Two methods were used for antioxidant evaluation of
crude extract as well as its active ingredients as follows:
a- DPPH method
The 2, 2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) tests
were carried out for evaluation of antioxidant activity
of samples as described by Burits and Bucar [18].
One mL of Eichhornia crude extract and fractions
at different concentration (From 5 to 500 μg/mL)
was mixed with 1 mL DPPH reagent [0.002%
(w/v)/ methanol solution]. After an incubation
period (30 min), the absorbance was measured at
517 nm. Extract concentration providing 50%
inhibition (IC50) was calculated from the graph
plotting inhibition percentages against extract
concentrations compared with Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and Butylated hydroxy toluene
(BHT) as synthetic antioxidant and Ascorbic acid
(Vit. C) as natural antioxidant standard.% Antioxidant activity Eð Þ¼ Ac‐Atð Þ=Acð Þ100
Where: Ac was the absorbance of methanolic DPPH
solution (control) and At was the absorbance of the
extract sample.
b- ABTS+ radical cation scavenging assay
This assay was based on the ability of different fractions
to scavenge 2, 2′- azino-bis (ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonic acid (ABTS.+) radical cation in comparison
to a standard ( BHA, BHT and Ascorbic acid). The
radical cation was prepared by mixing a 7 mM ABTS
stock solution with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate
(1/1, v/v) and leaving the mixture for 4-16 h until
the reaction was completed and the absorbance was
stable. The ABTS.+ solution was diluted with ethanol
to an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.05 at 734 nm for
measurements. The photometric Assay was conducted
on 0.9 mL of ABTS+ solution and 0.1 mL of tested
samples (in MeOH solution) and mixed for 45 s;
measurements were taken immediately at 734 nm
after 1 min. The antioxidant activity (E) of the tested
samples was calculated by determining the decrease
in absorbance at different concentrations by using
the following equation:
% Antioxidant activity Eð Þ¼ Ac‐Atð Þ=AcÞ100
Where At and Ac are the respective absorbance of
tested sample and ABTS+, [19]. Extracts
concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC50) was
calculated from the graph plotting inhibition
percentages against extract concentration.Assessment of anticancer activity
a- Cell culture
Human hepatocellular cancer cell line (HepG-2),
breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and cervix cancer
cell line (HeLa) were obtained from the Vacsera
(Giza, Egypt). Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100
units/mL penicillin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum in a humidified, 5% (v/v) CO2
atmosphere at 37°C [20]. Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma
Cells, EACC were obtained from National Cancer
Institute, NCI, (Cairo, Egypt) and cell line was
maintained in female albino mice by i.p transplantation
of 0.2 mL ascites which contains about 106 of tumor
cells in a liquid form and cells were taken for study
after 15-20 days of tumor transplantation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/397b- Cytotoxicity assays
1-Against solid tumor cell line
The cytotoxicity of crude extract and the
fractionated compounds were tested against HeLa,
HepG-2 and MCF-7 cells by SRB assay as
previously described [21] or by neutral red assay
[22]. Exponentially growing cells were collected
using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and plated in 96-well
plates at 1000-2000 cells/well. Cells were exposed to
each test compound for 72 h and subsequently fixed
with TCA (10%) for 1 h at 4°C. After several washings,
cells were exposed to 0.4% SRB {sulforhodamine B
(SRB), 2-(3-diethylamino-6-diethylazaniumylidene-
xanthen-9-yl)-5-sulfo-benzenesulfonate} solution for
10 min in dark place and subsequently washed
with 1% glacial acetic acid. After drying overnight,
Tris-HCl was used to dissolve the SRB-stained
cells and color intensity was measured at 540 nm.
Doxorubicin (DOX) purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as
anticancer standard.
Data analysis
The dose response curve of compounds was analyzed
using Emax model (Eq. 1).

Where R is the residual unaffected fraction (the resistance
fraction), [D] is the drug concentration used, Kd is the drug
concentration that produces a 50% reduction of the
maximum inhibition rate and m is a Hill-type coeffi-
cient. IC50 was defined as the drug concentration required
to reduce fluorescence to 50% of that of the control
(i.e., Kd = IC50 when R = 0 and Emax =100-R) [22].
2-Against liquid tumor cell line
The cytotoxicity of crude extract and its pure fractions
was also tested against EACC by viability trypan blue
exclusion test according to previous report [20]. In
details; A line of Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma resistant to
endoxan has been used. The parent line was first sup-
plied through the coursty of Dr. G. Klein, Amestrdam,
Holland. The tumor line is maintained in the National
Cancer Institute, Egypt in Female Swiss Albino Mice by
weekly transplantation of 2.5×106 cells were centrifuged
at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellets were washed
with saline (0.9% NaCl) then the needed number of cells
was prepared by suspending the cells in the appropriate
volume of saline. The viability percentage (V%) of tumor
cells was measured after incubation with the tested ex-
tract and fractions as well as DMSO as control. Two mLof cells (4×106 cells) were transferred into a set of tubes,
then different samples at different concentrations (5 to
500 μg/mL) were added into the propitiate tubes as well
as DMSO. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 2 h.
Then, in a test tube containing 80 μl saline and 10 μl trypan
blue, 10 μl of cell suspension were added and mixed then
the number of living cells was calculated under microscope
using a hemocytometer slide.
DNA extraction and electrophoresis
DNA of cancer cell lines before and after incubation with
crude plant extracts and each of the active identified
ingredients was extracted using AXYGEN Biosciences
(USA) extracted kit. The extracted DNA was precipi-
tated by ethanol and separated by centrifugation at
12000 rpm (at 4°C) for 15 min and the pellets were
purified. The purified DNA was electrophorised using
agarose gel electrophoresis at 150 V for about 90 min
to assess the degree of apoptotic DNA fragmentation
according to Gao et al., [23]. The DNA and its fragments
on gel were detected by treatment with ethidium bromide
and the florescence produced by UV light was photo-
graphed and analyzed using gel documentation system
(G box, syngene, UK).
Hypochromicity evaluation
This experiment was done to evaluate the possibility
of active ingredients (A-I) to interchelate with DNA
(isolated from EACC cell line), whose absorption decreases
upon binding at 260 nm (term called hypochromicity).
The comparison was done against free DNA and the
tested compounds.
Statistical analysis
Data were subjected to an analysis of variance, and the
means were compared using the “Least Significant Difference
(LSD)” test at 0.01 levels, as recommended by Snedecor and
Cochran [24]. Data are presented as mean± SD.
Results and discussion
Active ingredients
Nine fractions were separated and identified from water
hyacinth crude extract (Figures 1 and 2) and showed
biological activities as antioxidant and anticancer. The
obtained data of the spectroscopic analysis revealed the
nine compounds as; the alkaloid derivatives (A, D and F),
terpenoids derivatives (B, C, E, G, H and I). The more or
less comparable activities of the fractionated compounds
from methanolic crude extract of E. crassipes may be due
to the fact that all compounds have the common fragment
ions: 57, 71, 85, 149, 167 Da and these results were
confirmed by H1-NMR. The NMR data indicated that all
compounds had the following type of protons; A multiplex
signal at δ 6.89-7.47 ppm was characteristic of aromatic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/397protons (Compounds A-I) according to Edwards [25];
While, the singlet signal at δ 5.320 ppm was characteristic
of the two protons of olifinic (CH =CH) in compound A;
the singlet signal at δ 3.342 ppm was characteristic of four
protons of two O-CH2 group (Compounds B, C, D, E, F
and I); the singlet signal at δ 1.26, 1.6 and 2.5 ppm was
characteristic of the protons of methylene (CH2) group and
the singlet signal at δ 1.9 ppm was characteristic of protons
of methyl (CH3) group.
Antioxidant activity
The DPPH scavenging assay was performed to test the
antioxidant activity (as IC50) of both the crude methanolic
extract and the nine TLC separated fractions (compounds)
of Eichhornia crassipes (Table 1). The crude methanolic
extract showed the highest antioxidant activity with IC50 of
74.80 ± 4.5 μg/mL. Three of nine compounds recorded
more or less lower and comparable activities i.e. 92.40 ± 6.5,
95.4 ± 3.1 and 96.5 ± 2.7 μg/mL of compounds D, E and H.
Additionally, compounds B, C, F, G and I were illustrated
very close antioxidant effects with IC50 ranged between
97.0 ± 5.4 and 97.4 ± 2.7 μg/mL. However, compound A
showed very low effect (99.2 ± 5.8 μg/mL) as antioxidant
compared with synthetic (BHA and BHT) and natural
(Vit. C) Standards.Activity was decreased on separation of the fractions
in pure forms (compounds) and each more or less was
lower than that of the crude extract. The potent antioxidant
activity manifested by the crude extract in comparison to
those of the separated compounds may be due to the syner-
gistic action of the collective biologically active compounds
of one or more of the nine fractions in the crude extract. In
addition, the crude extract may have secondary metabolites
in very low concentration which enhance the active princi-
pals and increase the antioxidant efficiency. This suggestion
was previously confirmed by Chu et al [26] - Who men-
tioned that crude extract of Spirulina gave higher antioxi-
dant activity than pure compounds (phycocyanin). They
reported that the extract might contain other constituents
(e.g. phenolic compounds) which gave a higher combined
antioxidant activity than phycocyanin alone. The synergistic
action of a wide spectrum of antioxidants may be more
effective than the activity a single antioxidants.
It is difficult to give a definite explanation for mechanism
of antioxidant of Eichhornia purified compound dependent
on one assay. Thus, radical scavenging properties of the
pure compounds (A-I) were evaluated against ABTS radical
assay, and the results were compared with those of some
standard antioxidant (BHT, BHA and Ascorbic acid)
(Table 1). It was observed that those compounds showed
a markedly higher ability to scavenge ABTS radicals than
DPPH. The obtained data showed the trend concerning
the crude extract as well as tested compounds. Crude
extract scavenged the ABTS radical with IC50 values of
50.8 μg/mL. These values were better than the IC50 of
DPPH radical (74.8 μg/mL) and other fractions but less
than standard compounds (BHA, BHT and Ascorbic
acid; 9.4, 5.0 and 12.0 μg/mL respectively). This means
that, the compounds were strongly scavenged the
ABTS radical than that of DPPH radical. These results
are in agreement with those of Awika et al. [27] who
found that, ABTS is a better choice than DPPH and
more sensitive than DPPH. The ABTS method has the
extra flexibility in that it can be used at different pH levels
(unlike DPPH, which is sensitive to acidic pH) and thus is
useful when studying the effect of pH on antioxidant activ-
ity of various compounds. It is also useful for measuring
antioxidant activity of samples extracted in acidic solvents.
Additionally, ABTS is soluble in aqueous and organic sol-
vents and is thus useful in assessing antioxidant activity of
samples in different media and is currently most commonly
used in simulated serum ionic potential solution (pH 7.4
phosphate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl) (PBS). Another
advantage of ABTS +method was that samples reacted rap-
idly with ABTS in the aqueous buffer solution (PBS) reach-
ing a steady state within 30 min. The DPPH reacted very
slowly with the samples, approaching, but not reaching,
steady state after 8 h. This slow reaction was also observed
when ABTS reacted with samples in alcohol.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/397The antioxidant activity of active ingredients separated
from E. crassipes may be correlated with the presence of
hydroxyl group and unsaturated bonds in the chemical
structure of its compounds which show high ability for
scavenging free radicals and prevent the oxidation pro-
cesses. These observations were in agreement with the
previously published results [28].
ROS are products of a normal cellular metabolism and
play vital roles in the stimulation of signaling pathways in
plant and animal cells in response to changes in intra- and
extracellular environmental conditions [29]. Proteins, nu-
cleic acids and lipids were also significant targets for oxida-
tive attack, and modification of these molecules can increase
the risk of mutagenesis [30]. Therefore, antioxidants are
good scavengers for ROS and free radicals, on other word it
defends and protect cells from their bad action. The antioxi-
dants prevent damages of proteins, DNA (protect from mu-
tation) and lipid peroxidation (protect plasma membrane) in
living cells (normal cells).
Antitumor activity
SRB assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the crude
extract and its derived fractions against three different solidtumor cell lines and one ascites tumor cell line. Different
cell lines were used according to their origin and morph-
ology as well as sensitivity and receptor sites behavior.
The cytotoxicity parameter, IC50 was calculated using Emax
model as described in the Methods section. Compound
is considered strongly potent when IC50 is lower than
1 μg/mL; moderate if IC50 ranges from 1 μg/mL to
10 μg/mL; and weak for IC50 higher than 10 μg/mL. The
obtained results of the crude extract showed acceptable
potency against HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines with IC50
of 1.6 ± 0.5 and 1.2 ± 0.2 μg/mL, respectively. However,
HepG2 and EACC cell lines showed relatively higher
resistance against the crude extract with IC50 of 7.6 ± 1.5
and 6.04 ± 0.5 μg/mL respectively, when compared
with Doxorubicin (DOX) as standard anticancer drug
(with IC50 = 0.28, 0.42 and 0.42 μg/mL against Hela,
HepG2 and MCF-7 respectively) as shown in Table 2.
This means that the cytotoxicity pattern of the crude
extract on both MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines is similar
while differs on HepG2 and EACC (Figure 3). These re-
sults indicate that the effect of crude extract on MCF-7 and
Hela cells is concentration dependant through the concen-
trations tested (1-1000 μg/mL). In HepG2 cells however,

10 μg/mL) after which the effect was very strong hence
most of cells were died at about 15 μg/mL. This effect
can be explained as receptor independent for these type

Compound D showed also high potent cytotoxicity against
HeLa cervix cancer cell line (IC50 = 4.3 ± 2.3 μg/mL)
and the other compounds showed moderate cytotoxic
effect with IC50’s ranging from 7.7 to 14.1 μg/mL. With
respect to MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, compounds
H, B and A showed the best cytotoxic profile with IC50’s of
11.1 ± 6.1 μg/mL, 13.4 ± 1.9 μg/mL and 13.6 ± 5.3 μg/mL,
respectively. In addition, the other compounds G and C
showed mild cytotoxic effects with IC50’s ranging from 17.5
to 69.1 μg/mL. The other compounds showed much
humble cytotoxicity profile against HepG2 cell line with
IC50’s ranging from 14.9 to 74.2 μg/mL. Concerning
EACC cancer cell line, compounds D, C, E, A showed
high potency with IC50 of 6.42 ± 0.8, 7.29 ± 1.6, 8.19 ± 1.2
and 8.61 ± 2.1 μg/mL, respectively (Table 2). The other
compounds showed moderate effect with IC50 of
12.32 ± 2.7, 12.67 ± 4.2 and 22.79 ± 6.9 μg/mL for com-
pounds H, G and I, respectively. The effect of plant
extract and its compounds on EACC is very similar to
their effects on HeLa cells (Table 2).
It’s worth mentioning, that the higher potency of the
crude extract against cancer cell lines in special HeLa
and MCF-7 relative to all fractions (compounds) from
the same extract, might be attributed to auto-synergistic
effect of these fractions within the same extract. In addition,
the crude extract may have additional secondary metab-
olites in very low concentration which may enhance the
active principals and increase the anticancer efficiency in
addition to its stability against enzyme action of tumor cells
as mentioned in antioxidant activity [26].
The similar cytotoxic profile of the crude extract against
both HeLa (cervix cancer) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell
lines followed by EACC might be attributed to their
gynecological origin and hormone dependency [33]. Several
gynecological solid tumors such as breast and cervix
cancers are greatly influenced by hormone level and sig-
naling within tumor micro milieu [34,35]. Further stud-
ies are recommended to identify potential interference
between the isolated potent fractions and estrogenic sig-
naling pathway within gynecological tumors.
In liver cancer cell line, HepG2, the only compound
with promising potency was compound I, identified as
iso-octyl phthalate (IC50 = 0.8 ± 0.4 μg/mL). Similar trend
was noticed for HeLa and EACC cell lines hence, com-
pound D (methyl dioctyl phthalate) showed high potency
as anticancer. This information recommends further SAR
and QSAR studies to identify the exact target receptor for
these active compounds. Herein, it is interesting to notice
that most of the detected phthalate esters have a high
potency against cancer cell lines. The longest side chain-
ester of phthalate (compound D) has the strongest anti-
cancer activity against HeLa and EACC cell lines. In this

rivatives (compound B, C, D, E and I) had high ability for
inhibition of skin tumor promotion induced by 12-O-
tetradecanyl-phorbol-13-acetate. In addition, the present
data showed that compound D presented the lowest per-
centage in the crude extract (only 6%, Figure 4) but has
the highest antioxidant and anticancer activity. In contrast,
compound I represented the highest percentage fraction
(more than 17%) in the crude extract (Figure 4) and showed
the strongest anticancer activity against Hep-G2 and EACC
respectively (Table 2).

seem to have potent activity for the four cancer cell
lines tested in spite of the fact that they came in the
second order of anticancer activity. These compounds
constitute only about 22.5% (relative) of the crude
extract (G 8% and H 14.5%, Figure 4) which may be
more potent by increasing their contents in the media.
Therefore, experiment was done to confirm this probability
hence, incubation of cancer cells with higher concen-
trations of each compounds showed higher anticancer
activity (EACC was used, data not shown). Also using
mixture of the two compounds gave the most potency.
In spite of occurring compound G in crude extract in
lower percentage but it showed high anticancer activity
for the four cell lines used. In this respect, the two
compounds are very similar in their chemical structure
(formulas), hence they contain biphenyl linked through
methylene group and the later carries methyl group.
This structure may enhance liberation of methyl ion as
carbonium ion which affects DNA of cancer cells [37] or
cell proteins and/or enzymes. This liberated methyl ion
group can bind with N7- guanine base (or other bases)
in DNA and induce mutation which in turn stop cell life
cycle or kill these cancer cells [38]. This phenomenon
resulted in significant intensities of internucleosomal
DNA fragmentations, evidenced by the formation of a
DNA laddering on agarose gel (Figure 5), hallmark of
cells undergoing apoptosis. This means that nuclear
DNA was degraded to different fragments of about 200 bp
or its folds which appeared as ladder. This appeared clearly
by crude extract treatments and compound I followed by

and 8 respectively, Figure 5).
The presence of short side chain in compound H
(but not compound G) may enhance methyl ion liber-
ation due to their electro negativity potential. The po-
tency of H compound was expected, which showed
higher anticancer activity than compound G as noticed
in Table 2. Data of the present study also showed that,
HeLa cells and EACC have higher sensitivity to natural
anticancer (extracts or compounds) than HepG2 and
MCF-7 cell lines which showed resistant behavior for the
treatments. In this concern, we found that the incubation
of these cells with mixture of the high potent compounds
(I, F, G and D) gave high anticancer activity and the anti-
cancer effect was concentration dependent.
We did an additional experiment to test the interchela-
tion possibility of each compound with DNA of the cancer
cells (detection of hypochromicity through absorption atFigure 5 DNA fragmentation patterns obtained after incubation of te260 nm). Results in Table 3 and Figure 6 showed that com-
pound A was the only compound which can interchelate
with DNA while the other eight compounds (B-I) were not.
The absorbance of DNA+ compound mixture was in-
creased (loss of hypochromecity) after 2 and 24 h of mixture
which illustrated DNA damage. Therefore, the damage in
cancer cells by specific natural compounds did not depend
only on their interchelation with DNA but might also to
strands cleavage (DNA denaturation) or the base damages
[by alkylation and/or free radical attack] or its liberation.
In this concern, we conclude that natural anticancer
substances can affect cancer cells through their DNA
damage by different probability mechanisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/397In this concern, extensive research during the past 2
decades has revealed the mechanism by which continued
oxidative stress can lead to chronic inflammation, which
in turn could mediate most chronic diseases including
cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, neurological, and
pulmonary diseases. Oxidative stress can activate a
variety of transcription factors including NF-κB, AP-1,
p53, HIF-1α, PPAR-γ, β-catenin/Wnt, and Nrf2. Activation
of these transcription factors can lead to the expression of
over 500 different genes, including those of growth factors,
inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell cycle regulatory
molecules, and anti-inflammatory molecules [38].
On the other side, the role of antioxidant compounds
on growth inhibition of cancer cells could be explained
as one or more of following suggested mechanisms:
1. The resonance phenomena of double bonds and
lone pair atoms (N, S, O) in the chemical structure
of the active compound (Figure 2). This structure
may lead to radical formation in more than one site;
for example: benzene ring (A), this ring is near to
highly negativity group (nitro group); this condition
helps the benzene ring to convert it to radical
formation of new covalent bond with ABTS radical
(as antioxidant activity). This radical may react with
nitrogen bases of DNA and lead to mutation in
nucleic acid of cancer cells and affect cell division
(acts as anticancer activity) [39].
2. Normal tissues typically have median oxygen
concentrations in the range 40–60 mmHg, half of all
solid tumors have median values less than 10 mmHg
with fewer than 10% in the normal range. So, the
antioxidant compounds may be affecting on cancer
cells by providing high concentration of oxygen by
acting with its radicals form and in turn disturbs
tumor hypoxia needed for these cells [35].
3. Recent studies have demonstrated that antioxidant
compounds (including selenium) are also essentialelements of redox system, which has been shown to
have multiple functions, including regulating cell
growth and apoptosis [2,3]. Selenium may exert its
effects in cancer cells by altering intracellular redox
state, which subsequently results in cell cycle block.
In addition, these compounds have been
demonstrated to possess antitumorigenic activities in
animal models by inhibiting tumor initiation and
promotion through disturbing redox potential
system of tumor cells. This takes place via modifying
cellular antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes, thus
regulating the therapeutic effectiveness of natural
drugs in cancer therapy [40].
4. As recommendation, the addition of antioxidant
compounds with anticancer chemical drug enhances the
action of chemotherapies. In this concern, an antiestrogen
drug skeleton was found to induce cytotoxicity towards
breast-cancer cells that are resistant to the common
antiestrogen drug. The efficiency of this drug has been
related to the proton-coupled electron transfer observed
in the presence of pyridine as a base [41].
Conclusion
It can be concluded that the pronounced results may en-
courage a country-wide project for not only collecting and
getting rid of water Hyacinth but also making a pharmaco-
economic value in Egypt. Harvesting water hyacinth, not
only clean the drinking water from its deleterious effect but
also would be used for the production of pharmaceutical
remedies. In addition, they have scavenging antioxidant
properties against the reactive oxygen species. The present
study reveals the high potency of crude extracts as anti-
oxidants and potential anticancer in comparison to their
separated fractions. This crude extract represents favorable
economic and industrial value for the production of com-
mercial product. The pure compound separately or com-
bined with other compound(s) or/and crude extract could
be used as natural antioxidant and anticancer formulas.
