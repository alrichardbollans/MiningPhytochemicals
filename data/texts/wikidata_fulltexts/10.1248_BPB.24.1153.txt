Tinospora tuberculata, a plant belonging to the familyMenispermaceae, is distributed from the southwestern part ofChina to Southeast Asia including Vietnam, Thai, Malaysia,Indonesia and India, and is used widely as a folk medicine.This galenical has been used for its antipyretic, abdominalpain-relieving, antidiarrheal, detoxifying, anthelmintic andtonic actions.1) The pharmacological mechanisms of thisagent, however, are mostly unknown. Focusing on nitricoxide (NO), which mediates various physiological events in-cluding defense reactions of the body and whose increaseleads to the development of various diseases,2) we previouslystudied the effect of Tinospora tuberculata in mice and foundthat an aqueous extract inhibited the production of NO.3,4)The present study was designed to investigate the inhibitoryactivity of the aqueous extract of Tinospora tuberculata,using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents Thioglycollate broth was purchased fromWako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Amino-guanidine, LPS, pepstatin A, chymostatin, aprotinin, phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate (reduced, NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide(FAD), tetrahydrobiopterin, dithiothreitol (DTT), lactate de-hydrogenase (LDH) and sodium pyruvate were purchasedfrom Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.).Fractionation and Purification of Tinospora tuberculataAs shown in Fig. 1, dried stems of Tinospora tuberculata(1 kg) were powdered and extracted with water (3 l) at 60—70 °C three times. The residue was further extracted withmethanol (3 l) three times at room temperature. The aqueousextract was concentrated and partitioned between ethyl ac-etate and water five times to give ethyl acetate extract (frac-tion A, 7.7 g). The acqueous layer was further separated intothree fractions [fractions B (110 g), C (29.6 g), D (7.1 g)] byDiaion HP-20SS column chromatography with water con-taining increasing proportions of methanol. The methanolextract was also partitioned between ethyl acetate and waterto afford ethyl acetate extract (fraction E, 15.2 g) and anaqueous layer (fraction F, 16.6 g). The biologically activefraction E (14.3 g) was further separated by silica gel columnchromatography (chloroform–methanol–water) into five frac-tions [fractions E-1 (1.39 g), E-2 (4.42 g), E-3 (2.73 g), E-4(3.01 g), E-5 (3.25 g)]. The major constituent of fraction E-3(1.7 g) was purified by Sephadex LH-20 (80% methanol) fol-lowed by silica gel column chromatography (hexane–ethylacetate, 1 : 2) to yield N-trans-feruloyltyramine (370 mg),which was identified by spectral comparison.Spectral Data of N-trans-Feruloyltyramine A whitepowder, FAB-MS m/z: 314 (M1H)1, IR (diffusive reflection)nmax cm21: 3300, 1652, 1587, 1510.

The aqueous extract was partitionedwith ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was fractionated with a Diaion column. The residue of the aqueous extractwas extracted with methanol, and partitioned with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was found to be associ-ated with a distinct decrease in the NO level and inducible NO synthase. On further fractionation, the subfrac-tion of E-3 showed high anti-NO activity. N-trans-Feruloyltyramine isolated from E-3 was identified as exhibitingstrong anti-NO activity. This compound is the most active component of Tinospora tuberculata with respect to thesuppression of NO production.Key words Tinospora tuberculata; N-trans-feruloyltyramine; nitric oxide; inducible nitric oxide synthase; macrophageFig. 1d, J58.1 Hz, H-59), 6.683 (2H, br d, J58.5 Hz, H-3, 5), 6.341(1H, d, J515.7 Hz, H-89), 3.808 (3H, s, OCH3), 3.357 (2H,dt, J55.7, 7.4 Hz, H-8), 2.647 (2H, t, J57.4 Hz, H-7). 13C-NMR (75 MHz, DMSO-d6) d : 165.7 (C-99), 155.6 (C-4),148.2, 147.8 (C-39, 49), 138.9 (C-79), 129.5 (C-1), 129.4 (C-2, 6), 126.4 (C-19), 121.5 (C-69), 119.0, 115.6, 110.8 (C-29,59, 89), 115.0 (C-2, 6), 55.5 (OCH3), 40.7 (C-8), 34.4 (C-7).Animals Male BALB/c strain mice (Japan SLC, Inc.,Hamamatsu, Japan), 6 weeks of age, were used. This studycomplied with the “Guidelines for Animal Experimentation”approved by Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University.They were kept in an air-conditioned room with lightingfrom 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and given commercial pellet chow(Clea Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan; comprising 24.0% protein,3.5% lipid and 60.5% carbohydrate) and water ad libitum.Cell Culture and Assay According to the method ofLefkowitz et al.,6) mice were injected intraperitoneally with1.5 ml of a 4% thioglycollate broth. After 4 d, the animalswere sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Peritoneal lavage wasperformed using cold RPMI 1640 medium. Peritonealmacrophages were centrifuged at 10003g for 2 min, and thesedimented cells were resuspended at a density of 13106/mlin 5% fetal calf serum (FCS)-supplemented RPMI 1640medium. The cell suspension was added to each well of a 6-well or 96-well tissue culture plate. After 2 h of incubation ina humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, the medium wasremoved and cells were washed with phosphate bufferedsaline (PBS) to remove those that were nonadherent. TheTinospora tuberculata sample or aminoguanidine with10 mg/ml LPS was then added to each well. The plates wereincubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for24 h. Aliquots of the medium were used to measure NO andcell viability. Nitrite was used as an indicator of NO produc-tion and measured by a microplate assay method based onthe Griess reaction.7) Cell viability was estimated by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bro-mide (MTT) assay.8) For the assay of cell lysates, cells werewashed three times with PBS, scraped into cold PBS, andcentrifuged at 5003g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet ob-tained was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 40 mM Tris–buffer (pH8.0) containing 5 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml chymostatin,5 mg/ml aprotinin and 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing. Aliquots of thelysate were used for the determination of inducible NO syn-thase (iNOS) activity, and protein assay. iNOS activity wasmeasured as described previously.9) Briefly, 10—20 mg ofcell lysate protein was incubated in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH7.9), containing 4 mM FAD, 4 mM tetrahydrobiopterin, 3 mMDTT, and 2 mM each of L-arginine (L-Arg) and NADPH. Thereaction was carried out in duplicate for 180 min at 37 °C in96-well plates. Residual NADPH was oxidized enzymaticallywith 10 units/ml LDH and 5 mM sodium pyruvate in a finalvolume of 130 m l, with incubation for a further 5 min at37 °C, and the Griess assay was performed as above.7) Pro-tein was determined by the micro-biuret method,10) withbovine serum albumin as a standard.Statistics Results were assessed by analysis of variance,followed by Dunnett’s test. Significance was accepted atp,0.05.RESULTSNO Production Exposure to LPS induced the produc-tion of a large amount of NO, about 6.9-fold that observed inthe blank. When macrophages were cultured under identicalconditions, but with different doses of Tinospora tuberculataextract, NO production was substantially inhibited in a con-centration-dependent manner, as shown in Table 1. After sep-aration of the extract, a significant difference in inhibitoryactivity was observed among the various fractions. The in-hibitory activity of fractions C and F was weaker than that ofthe extract as a whole. In contrast, fraction E showed an ap-parent activity that was stronger than the extract. We furtherseparated fraction E. Of the subfractions obtained, E-3 hadthe highest activity, inducing the production of 9.08 mM ofNO at 50 mg/ml and 6.39 mM at 100 mg/ml. Fractions E-1 andE-5, by contrast, had no ameliorative effect on production.We next examined N-trans-feruloyltyramine isolated fromfraction E-3 and found that it inhibited NO production in aconcentration-dependent manner, as shown in Table 1. Theinhibition induced by 50 mg/ml N-trans-feruloyltyramine re-sembled that induced by 100 mM aminoguanidine.iNOS Activity In activated macrophages, enhanced for-mation of NO was associated with the expression of iNOSactivity. As shown in Table 1, exposure of macrophages toLPS caused a significant increase in iNOS activity from 6.89to 27.66 pmol/mg protein/min. Treatment of the cells withTinospora tuberculata extract inhibited iNOS activity in aconcentration-dependent manner. iNOS activity was de-creased approximately to 86, 72 and 66% of LPS-stimulatedcontrol values, in 50, 100 and 200 mg/ml of Tinospora tuber-culata extract-treated cells, respectively. Examination of itsfractions showed that fraction E possessed higher inhibitoryactivity than the extract itself. Among the subfractions ob-tained from fraction E, fraction E-3 appeared to moststrongly inhibit iNOS activity, while such activity was passedinto N-trans-feruloyltyramine isolated from fraction E-3. Theinhibition induced by 50 mg/ml N-trans-feruloyltyramine re-sembled that induced by 100 mM aminoguanidine.Cell Viability To test and verify that the inhibitory effectof the Tinospora tuberculata extract, fraction and componenton NO production was not due to cytotoxicity, we examinedtheir effect on the viability of activated macrophages. Asshown in Table 1, LPS impaired cell viability significantly ascompared with nontreated cells. However, it was found thatthe cytotoxic effect of LPS was attenuated by incubation withTinospora tuberculata extract and its fractions except B, Cand E-1. N-trans-Feruloyltyramine was also able to protectcells that had been exposed to LPS. Although N-trans-feru-loyltyramine improved the cell viability, aminoguanidine ap-peared to have no ameliorative effect on the cytotoxicity dueto LPS.DISCUSSIONLiving organisms utilize the chemical properties of NO forthe intracellular and intercellular processes of cGMP-medi-ated communication. NO itself is cytotoxic, however, andproduces secondary active substances through a reactionwith oxygen and active oxygen species. Therefore, the pro-duction of a substantial amount of NO due to increased im-1154 Vol. 24, No. 10munological activity can cause disease. Thus, the NO pro-duced at the site of infection by inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, or by epithelial cells(bronchus, bowel), is attracting attention as a mediator of in-flammatory responses. Macrophages are known to produceNO through the metabolism of L-Arg by NOS promptly in re-sponse to stimulation at the site of infection, inflammation,and immune responses.2) However, excessive production ofNO may cause shock and injury to living tissue. In light ofthis, an effort is now being made to develop a specific NOSinhibitor effective in macrophages.11—13)We have previously reported that the aqueous extract of Tinospora tuberculata inhibited NO production inmacrophages in a dose-dependent manner.3) The effects ofTinospora tuberculata were also evident in a cell-free sys-tem; Tinospora tuberculata inhibited the production of NOfrom L-Arg and hydrogen peroxide, and dose-dependentlysuppressed the release of NO donors from sodium nitroprus-side.4) In the present study, we investigated the active compo-nent of Tinospora tuberculata, using macrophages.Macrophages stimulated by LPS produced a large quantityof NO, with increased iNOS activity and decreased cell via-bility. In macrophages treated with a stepwise dose ofTinospora tuberculata extract, the level of NO and the iNOSactivity were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner, whilecell viability was increased. Tinospora tuberculata was thenexamined to establish the component responsible for the ac-tivity found in its aqueous extract. Six fractions were ob-tained from aqueous Tinospora tuberculata extract and itsresidue. The residue was then extracted with methanol, andthe methanol extract was partitioned with ethyl acetate. Theethyl acetate layer thus obtained was found to have the mostactivity. Fractions having a bitter taste characteristic of thisgalenical had no effect, suggesting that borapetosides A, B, Cand D, and borapetol B have no activity to inhibit the produc-tion of NO. The ethyl acetate layer, containing a large quan-October 2001 1155Table 1.

The fraction richest in N-trans-feru-loyltyramine proved to have the highest level of activity toinhibit the NO production. It became apparent that the com-ponent responsible for the inhibitory activity of Tinospora tu-berculata was N-trans-feruloyltyramine isolated from thisfraction. The present study revealed a new effect of this com-ponent, the suppression of NO production from macrophages,in parallel with the suppression of iNOS activity. This anti-NO activity was comparable to the effect of aminoguanidine,a specific inhibitor of iNOS.N-trans-Feruloyltyramine was found in the stem of driedTinospora tuberculata by Fukuda et al.,5) and has been de-tected in eggplants14) and leeks.15) However, little is knownabout the physiological activity of N-trans-feruloyltyramine,though a marked inhibitory effect of this compound onplatelet aggregation was reported by Okuyama et al.15) Theinhibition of NO production via iNOS is a new effect ofTinospora tuberculata demonstrated in the present study.However, it is presumed that the NO produced by macro-phages through metabolism of L-Arg protects the body in cooperation with the cytokine network centering on inter-feron-g and other defense factors (active oxygen, etc.), ratherthan independently by itself.16,17) On the other hand, Tracey etal.18) demonstrated that purified NOS from brain (neuronNOS), macrophages (iNOS) and endothelium (endothelialNOS) all showed NADPH-diaphorase activity; the relativeactivities were: macrophage.endothelium.brain. Thesedata indicate that all known NOSs are NADPH-diaphorases.Mitchell et al.19) have also published data showing that inmacrophages, both NADPH-diaphorase and NOS activitiescan be induced by LPS. Moreover, NADPH-diaphorase ac-tivity appeared in the peritoneal macrophages of LPS-pre-treated mice after the induction of pancreatitis, and the ele-vated NO was inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine.20) Althoughfurther studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms bywhich N-trans-feruloyltyramine exerts its inhibitory actions,Tinospora tuberculata extract inhibited NADPH-diaphoraseactivity dose-dependently.3) N-trans-Feruloyltyramine seemsto suppress NO production due to inhibition of NADPH-di-aphorase.The ideal NO inhibitor would block only the harmful ef-fects of NO, while maintaining or enhancing the beneficialeffects. Recent studies have yielded several compoundswhich have very high activity and relatively high selectivity.Aminoguanidine is among these compounds and attractingattention as a specific iNOS inhibitor.21) N-trans-Feruloyl-tyramine at 50 mg/ml was found to have a level of activityequivalent to 100 mM of aminoguanidine. However, unlikeaminoguanidine, the cell viability decreased by LPS was re-stored in the presence of this compound, demonstrating thevery low toxicity of this iNOS inhibitor.REFERENCES1) Farnsworth N.
