LeavesReceived for publication December 18, 1984 and in revised form April 12, 1985FAYEK B. NEGM* AND GARY C. MARLOW'Department ofFloriculture and Ornamental Horticulture, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853ABSTRACTThis study presents evidence for a new enzyme, D-ribose-5-P reductase,which catalyzes the reaction: D-ribose-5-P + NADPH + H+ -Dribitol-5-P + NADPI. The enzyme was isolated from Adonis vernalis L. leavesin 38% yield and was purified 71-fold. The reductase was NADPHspecific and had a pH optimum in the range of 5.5 to 6.0. The Michaelisconstant value for D-ribose-5-P reduction was 1.35 millimolar. Theenzyme also reduced D-erythrose4-P, D-erythrose, DL-glyceraldehyde,and the aromatic aldehyde 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. Hexoses, hexosephosphates, pentoses, and dihydroxyacetone did not serve as substrates.D-Ribose-5-P reductase is distinct from the other known ribitol synthe-sizing enzymes detected in bacteria and yeast, and may be responsiblefor ribitol synthesis in Adonis vernalis.Ribitol, a five-carbon sugar alcohol, is commonly referred toas adonitol which reflects its first definitive characterization byMerck in 1893 from the leaves of Adonis vernalis L. (20). Theribitol content of Adonis leaves can vary from 0.9 to 5.3% dryweight depending on the species (8, 17) (Chem Abstr 86: 40277c,1977; Chem Abstr 96: 214320k, 1982). The only other higherplant in which ribitol has been identified is Bupleurum (30)(Chem Abstr 64: 6731, 1966), although it has also been reportedto occur in fungi, algae, and lichen symbionts (3).The metabolism of pentoses and their phosphate esters hasbeen intensively investigated in bacteria (23) and to a lesserextent in yeast (2), but in higher plants they have received littleattention other than their identification as intermediates in thereductive and oxidative pentose phosphate cycles and as struc-tural components of cell walls and gums (15). To our knowledge,the only research involving ribitol metabolism in higher plantswas the observed formation of starch from ribitol in Adonisleaves over 70 years ago (29). No enzymes capable ofsynthesizingor utilizing ribitol have been isolated from Adonis although suchenzymes have been reported from other sources (10, 11, 19, 24).A plant containing a relatively large five-carbon pool posessome interesting metabolic questions. To begin this investigationas well as to elucidate further the roles of polyols in higher plants,we have identified an enzyme which may be partially responsiblefor ribitol synthesis in Adonis vernalis L.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Boviney-globulin was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. D-Ribitol-' Present address: Department of Plant Pathology, University of Flor-ida 1443 HSPP. Gainesville, FL 32611.5-P was prepared from D-ribose-5-P by NaBH4 reduction as perSupelco bulletin 774A (28) except that after termination of thereaction with glacial acetic acid, 5 ml of IRA-20 in acid formwere added, mixed, and then filtered off. The final concentrationof D-ribitol-5-P was determined by GLC.Partial Purification of n-Ribose-5-Phosphate Reductase.Adonis vernalis L. leaves were obtained from plants in MinnsGarden, Cornell University. Homogenization and all subsequentsteps were carried out in a cold room at 2°C. In a typicalpreparation, 25 g of leaves were washed in distilled H20 andhomogenized in 250 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.5)containing I mM DTT, 10 mM isoascorbate, and 10 g insolublePVP which had been prewetted with 100 ml of the extractionbuffer 1 h prior to homogenization. Homogenization was con-ducted with a Waring blendor for two 5-s bursts at full speed,followed by three 15-s bursts at full speed on a Polytron homog-enizer equipped with a PTA 20 ST generator. The homogenatewas squeezed through polypropylene cloth, 149 ,uM mesh open-ings (Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles, CA), and thefiltrate was centrifuged at 4,068g for 20 min. The supernatantwsa centrifuged at 23,430g for 30 min. The resulting supernatantwas treated with (NH4)2SO4 and the precipitate sedimented at 30to 70% saturation was dissolved in a minimum volume ofbufferand dialyzed overnight against 2 L 10 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.5)containing 0.1 mM DTT, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (bufferA). The dialysate was centrifuged at 26,890g for 30 min and thesupernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 x 90cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.5) containing0.2 mm DTT (buffer B). The enzyme was eluted with buffer Bat a rate of 17 ml/h. Active fractions were pooled and concen-trated using an Amicon PM-10 ultrafiltration membrane (Ami-con Corp.). An aliquot of the PM- 10 concentrate was applied toa Reactive Red 120-Agarose column (I x 7 cm) previouslyequilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with bufferB until no protein was detected in the eluate, washed with 50 mlNADP (I mm in buffer B), and followed by an additional 50 mlbuffer B. The enzyme was then eluted with 1.5 M KCI in bufferB and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. Active fractions werepooled and concentrated using an Amicon PM-10 ultrafiltrationmembrane and this fraction was dialyzed overnight against 1 Lof buffer A.Enzyme Assays. D-Ribose-5-P reductase was assayed by re-cording the oxidation of NADPH in the presence of D-ribose-5-P at 340 nm with a Perkin-Elmer model 552 spectrophotometerequipped with a constant temperature cuvette. Unless otherwiseindicated, assays were performed at 25°C in a reaction mixture(1 ml) containing 1 10 ,uM NADPH, 90 mM Na-phosphate (pH5.7), 25 ,l enzyme (affinity fraction), and 5 mM D-ribose-5-P.Reactions were initiated by the addition of the substrate 2.5 minafter the enzyme was incubated with NADPH. Control cuvettescontained all reagents except substrates. NADPH concentrationwas determined from A340 by using a molar extinction coefficient758 www.plantphysiol.orgon May 1, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1985 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Specific activity is expressed as units/mg protein. Protein concentration was determined by the methodof Bradford (4), using bovine -y-globulin as a standard.PAGE was carried out as described by Davis (7). Gels werestained for protein according to the method of Chrambach et al.(5). The reductase activity was detected by incubating the gel inthe dark at 37°C for I h in a mixture which contained 100 mmTris-HCI (pH 9.0), 20 mm D-ribitol-5-P, I mM NADP, 0.04 mg/ml phenazine methosulfate, and 0.4 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazo-lium.The product of the reaction mixture, D-ribitol-5-P, was iden-tified by gas chromatography as described by Srivastava et al.(27). To further identify the product, the reaction mixture wastreated with acid phosphatase (25). Samples were injected into aHP5730A gas chromatograph equipped with 183 x 0.31-cm i.d.stainless steel column packed with 3% SE-30 on CromosorbWHP, 80 to 100 mesh (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA). Thenitrogen flow rate was 30 ml/min and temperature of the injec-tion port was kept at 150C. After injection, column temperaturewas increased from 140° to 240NC at 4°C/min.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTable I summarizes the results of a typical purification proce-dure of D-ribose-5-P reductase from Adonis vernalis leaves. Theenzyme was purified 71-fold with 38% yield. The enzyme wasretained by the affinity material and was not eluted with 1 mMNADP. Polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the final prep-aration revealed three closely spaced protein bands. D-Ribose-5-P reductase activity as assayed with D-ribitol-5-P was associatedwith one of these bands. The dissociation of other aldose reduc-tases on polyacrylamide gel during electrophoresis has beenreported by others (1, 18, 26). The possibility still remains thatother contaminating protein might be present. The partiallypurified enzyme gradually lost its activity during storage at 1°C.Seventy-five percent of the activity was lost by the end of thesecond week. The enzyme was not activated by sulfate ion as hasbeen reported for aldose reductase from calf lens (14). Lithiumor ammonium sulfates at 400 mm inhibited the enzyme by 80%.Similar inhibition has been reported for aldose reductases fromdifferent sources (1, 26).To test cofactor requirement and precursor for ribitol synthe-sis, D-ribose, D-ribulose, D-ribose-5-P, and D-ribulose-5-P weretested at variable concentrations (5 to 200 mM) and over a pHrange from 5 to I1 in the presence of either NADH or NADPH.The results indicate that the enzyme is specific for D-ribose-5-Pand NADPH (Table II). The product of this reaction mixturewas identified by gas chromatography as D-ribitol-5-P (retentiontime 17.0 min compared with 15.6 min for D-ribose-5-P). Acidphosphatase-treated reaction mixture gave a peak correspondingto o-ribitol (retention time, 8.02 min) which is separated fromD-ribose (retention time, 6.33 min). Slight reaction (14%) oc-curred with o-ribulose-5-P and NADPH (Table II) which couldbe due to contamination of commercial o-ribulose-5-P withtraces of D-ribose-5-P. Incubation ofthe enzyme with D-ribulose-5-P prior to starting the reaction with NADPH did not changethe relative rates of the reaction indicating the absence ofD-ribose-5-P isomerase in the final enzyme preparation.As shown in Figure 1, the enzyme displayed the highestactivity, using D-ribose-5-P as a substrate, between pH 5.5 and6.0 in 100 mM Na-phosphate buffer. Below pH 5, the enzymewas inactivated. Maximum activity was observed at 40°C (5.08units/mg protein) (Fig. 2).The Km value for o-ribose-5-P was 1.35 mM at 25°C in Na-phosphate buffer, pH 5.7 (Fig. 3). The relative activity of theenzyme towards a variety of substrates is presented in Table II.The substrates were tested at 5 mM final concentration and theirrate of reduction was compared with D-ribose-5-P. Hexose phos-phates, hexoses, and pentoses were not reduced. The enzyme hasa greater affinity for E-ribose-5-P than for other pentose phos-phates. D-Erythrose-4-P was reduced at a much higher rate thaneither D-ribose-5-P and DL-glyceraldehyde-3-P. It is interestingto note that even though the enzyme was inactive with f3-D-alloseand D-ribose, it was active with D-erythrose and DL-glyceralde-hyde. These aldoses have similar molecular structures, but itappears that the enzyme has a higher affinity for C4 and C3 thanC5 or C6 aldoses. In addition to the above substrates, the enzymestrongly reduced the aromatic aldehyde, 3-pyridinecarboxalde-hyde.The following is a list of the possible reactions for o-ribitolbiosynthesis:(A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)(G)(H)D-Ribulose + NADHi-Ribulose + NADPHi-Ribose + NADHD-Ribose + NADPHi)-Ribulose-5-P + NADHi-Ribulose-5-P + NADPHi-Ribose-5-P + NADHD-Ribose-5-P + NADPHPiDRibitol-5-P*D/RibitolRoute (A) has been identified in bacteria (10). Route (B) hasbeen reported in nematode Turbatrix aceti (24). Route (C) is notvery common, but Clancy and Coffey (6) detected an NADHpolyol dehydrogenase activity in uredospores of rust fungus usingo-ribose as substrate. Route (D) has been found in bacteria (31),yeast (19), fungi (22), and bull seminal vesicle (12). Assumingthe presence of a phosphatase, route (E) has been detected inbacteria (1 1). Route (F) has been reported in bacteria (1 1). Route(G) has been demonstrated in extracts of bean rust uredosporesand rust-infected plants (J. W. Hendrix, J. M. Daly, A.

Route (H) has been reported in silk-worm haemolymph (9).As can be seen from the substrate utilized (Table II), theenzyme isolated from Adonis vernalis leaves is distinct fromaldose reductase (14), L-hexonate dehydrogenase (21), aldehydereductase ( 1 3), succinic semialdehyde reductase ( 16), and glyceroldehydrogenase (18) in its reaction with phosphorylated aldoseseven though there is an overlapping ofsome substrates, especially3-pyridine carboxaldehyde and C3 and C4 aldoses. The only otherenzyme that reduced i.-ribose-5-P in the presence ofNADPH isthat reported by Faulkner (9) from silkworm blood.D-Ribose-5-P is a key metabolite in several metabolic path-ways such as the oxidative and reductive pentose phosphatecycles and nucleotide synthesis.
