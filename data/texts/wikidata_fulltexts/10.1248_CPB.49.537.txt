Phyllanthus emblica L. (Euphorbiaceae) is a shrub or treegrowing in subtropical and tropical areas of the People’s Re-public of China, India, Indonesia, and the Malay Peninsula.The whole plant, especially the fruit has been used as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug in many local traditionalmedicines: Chinese herbal medicine, Tibetan medicine, andAyurvedic medicine.1) Several reports about this plant haveshown that the fruits are rich in vitamin C, mucic acid, andtannins.2—6) In our previous work,7,8) a novel highly oxy-genated norbisabolane together with its methyl ester andthree ester glycosides were isolated from the roots of theplant along with 15 tannins and related compounds. As partof our continuing studies on the plant, we report herein theisolation and structural elucidation of new phenolic con-stituents, L-malic acid 2-O- (1), mucic acid 2-O- (5), mucicacid 1,4-lactone 2-O- (6), 5-O- (8), 3-O- (10), 3,5-di-O- (11)gallates, and their methyl esters (2—4, 7, 9) from the fruitjuice of P. emblica.Results and DiscussionA 60% aqueous acetone extract of the powdered form offruit juice of P. emblica was subjected to MCI gel CHP 20Pcolumn chromatography to afford five fractions. Fraction 1obtained by elution with H2O was further chromatographedsuccessively over Sephadex LH-20, MCI gel CHP20P, Toy-opearl HW-40F, and Cosmosil 75C18 OPN to afford com-pounds 1—11 and three known compounds. By comparisonof the physical and spectral data with those of authentic sam-ples, the known compounds were identified as gallic acid,chebulic acid,9) and 1-O-galloyl-b-D-glucose,10) respectively.Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powderand showed a dark blue coloration with ferric chloridereagent. Its molecular formula was assigned as C11H10O9 onthe basis of the 13C-NMR spectral data, the negative-ionFAB-MS [m/z 285, (M2H)2], and elemental analysis. The13C-NMR spectrum of 1 showed signals due to two carboxylcarbons at d 170.9 and 170.6, an oxygen bearing methine atd 69.4 and a methylene at d 36.5, along with a set of carbonsarising from a galloyl group. Hydrolysis of the galloyl esterwith tannase yielded gallic acid and L-malic acid ([a]D22.79°). In addition, the appearance of the methine protonsignal of the malic acid moiety at low field (d 5.60) indicatedthe galloyl group was attached to this position. Hence, thestructure of 1 was determined to be L-malic acid 2-O-gallate.The molecular formula of compound 2 was shown to beC15H18O12 based on the 13C-NMR spectral data, the positive-ion FAB-MS [m/z 391, (M1H)1], and elemental analysis.The 1H-, 13C-NMR, and heteronuclear single quantum coher-ence (HSQC) spectra of 2 indicated the presence of two car-boxyl carbons (d 170.6, 174.8), four oxygen bearing me-thines [dC 73.4, 71.9, 71.0, 70.6, corresponding to dH 5.55(d, J52.0 Hz), 4.10 (dd, J51.5, 10.0 Hz), 4.62 (d, J51.5 Hz),4.40 (dd, J52.0, 10.0 Hz), respectively], two methoxylgroups [d 52.7, 52.5, corresponding to dH 3.79, 3.75 (each3H, s)], and a galloyl group [dH 7.24 (2H, s)]. In the het-eronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) spectrum,the two methoxyl groups (d 3.79, 3.75) were correlated withthe two carboxyl carbons at d 170.6 (C-1) and d 174.8 (C-6),May 2001 Chem.

R. China.Received October 25, 2000; accepted January 18, 2001Six new phenolic constituents, L-malic acid 2-O- (1), mucic acid 2-O- (5), mucic acid 1,4-lactone 2-O- (6), 5-O- (8), 3-O- (10), and 3,5-di-O- (11) gallates, were isolated from the fruit juice of Phyllanthus emblica togetherwith their methyl esters (2—4, 7, 9), and their structures were determined by spectral and chemical methods.Compounds 5, 6, and 8, the major phenolic constituents of the juice, were present as an equilibrium mixture inaqueous solution. Key words Phyllanthus emblica; Euphorbiaceae; organic acid gallate; mucic acidChart 1respectively. In addition, correlations of a doublet methineproton at d 5.55 (H-2) with the C-1 and the carboxyl carbon(d 166.7) of galloyl group indicated that 2 was a 2-O-gallateof 2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxyladipic acid (mucic acid) dimethylester. The dimethyl ester was obtained by hydrolysis of 2with tannase and identified as mucic acid dimethyl ester bydirect comparison with an authentic sample. Accordingly, thestructure of 2 was established as mucic acid dimethyl ester 2-O-gallate.Compounds 3 and 4 showed the same (M1H)1 ion peak atm/z 377 in the positive-ion FAB-MS, which was 14 massunits less than that of 2 and suggested the lack of a methoxylgroup. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data of 3 and 4 closelyresembled those of 2, except for the absence of one of thetwo methoxyl signals. The presence of a mucic acid core intheir molecules was confirmed by tannase hydrolysis fol-lowed by methylation affording mucic acid dimethyl ester. Inthe HMBC spectra of 3 and 4, H-2 (d 5.58 for 3, d 5.55 for4) was correlated with C-1 (d 170.6 for 3, d 170.2 for 4) andthe carboxyl carbon of galloyl group (d 166.2 for 3, d 166.3for 4). However, the methoxyl proton (d 3.71) of 3 was cor-related with the C-6 (d 174.6), while the methoxyl proton (d3.73) of 4 was coupled with the C-1 (d 170.2). This observa-tion indicated that these two compounds were positional iso-mers differing in the location of their methoxyl group.Hence, the structures of 3 and 4 were established as mucicacid 6-methyl ester 2-O-gallate (3) and mucic acid 1-methylester 2-O-gallate (4), respectively.The molecular formula of compound 5 was assigned asC13H14O12 based on the 13C-NMR spectral data, the negative-ion FAB-MS [m/z 361, (M2H)2], and elemental analysis.Chemical shifts and coupling patterns of the 1H-NMR spec-trum of 5 as well as its 13C-NMR spectral data were verysimilar to those of 2—4, except for the absence of methylsignals, indicating that this compound is the free acid form of2—4. Thus, the structure of 5 was determined as mucic acid2-O-gallate.Compound 6 was obtained as a white amorphous powder.Its 1H-, 13C-NMR, and HSQC spectra revealed the presenceof two carboxyl groups (d 171.0, 173.0), four oxygen bear-ing methines [dC 82.0, 75.5, 72.4, 68.2, corresponding to dH4.76 (dd, J51.8, 8.4 Hz), 5.97 (d, J58.7 Hz), 4.87 (dd,J58.7, 8.4 Hz), 4.49 (d, J51.8 Hz), respectively], and a gal-loyl group [dH 7.18 (2H, s)]. The composition of 6 was simi-lar to that of 5; however, their chemical shifts and couplingconstants were significantly different. The core alcohol of 6was shown to be mucic acid because it became an equilib-rium mixture with 5 in aqueous solution and even in theNMR sample tube (acetone-d61D2O). The positive-ion FAB-MS of 6 showed the (M1H)1 ion peak at m/z 345, whichwas 18 mass units less than that of 5, indicating that 6 is alactone form of 5. Among the above-mentioned four methineprotons, two doublet signals at d 5.97 and 4.49 were assigna-ble to H-2 or H-5 of the mucic acid core. In the HMBC spec-trum, one of the doublet signals at d 5.97 was correlated withtwo carboxyl signals at d 171.0 and 166.5, the latter beingassignable to the carboxyl carbon of the galloyl group, indi-cating that the galloyl group was located at this position. Fur-thermore, the chemical shift of the other doublet signal indi-cated that this position was not acylated. Since the lactoneformation usually occurs at g (1,4-lactone) or d (1,5-lactone)position, this observation suggested that the mucic acid moi-ety in 6 existed as a 1,4-lactone form. Although locations ofthe two esters could not be determined by the HMBC experi-ment, this was achieved by comparison of the 1H-NMR spec-trum with that of D-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (12), which isa C-4 epimer of mucic acid with the same relative configura-tions at C-2 and C-3 positions. The H-2 signal of 12 ap-peared as a doublet signal with large coupling constant(J2,358.7 Hz, J3,457.8 Hz, J4,552.8 Hz), and the J value coin-cided with that observed for the methine signal at d 5.97 of 6where the galloyl group was located. This indicated that thegalloyl group of 6 was attached to the hydroxyl group adja-cent to the lactone carbonyl carbon. Based on the above evi-dence, the structure of 6 was concluded to be mucic acid 1,4-lactone 2-O-gallate.The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 7 was almost super-imposable on that of 6, except for the appearance of an addi-tional methyl signal at d 3.81(s). The positive-ion FAB-MSof 7 showed the (M1H)1 ion peak at m/z 359, which was 14mass units more than that of 6, indicating the occurrence of amethyl group in 7. Accordingly, 7 was determined as mucicacid 1,4-lactone 6-methyl ester 2-O-gallate.Compound 8 was obtained as a white amorphous powder.Its molecular composition C13H12O11 was identical to that of6. Coupling patterns of four methine signals observed in the1H-NMR spectrum were similar to those of 6; however, theH-5 of 8 resonated at lower field [d 5.57 (d, J52.1 Hz)] com-pared with that of 6 [dH 4.49 (d, J51.8 Hz)], and instead, theH-2 was shifted to higher field [d 4.71 (d, J58.7 Hz) for 8, d5.97 (d, J58.7 Hz) for 6]. This observation clearly indicatedthat the galloyl group was attached to C-5 in 8, which wasalso supported by the lower field shift of C-5 (d 74.4) and theupper field shift of C-2 (d 74.0) compared to those of 6 [d68.2 (C-5), d 75.5 (C-2)]. According to the above evidence,the structure of 8 was established as mucic acid 1,4-lactone5-O-gallate.Compound 9 exhibited the (M1H)1 ion peak at m/z 359,and 1H-NMR spectrum was very similar to that of 8 exceptfor occurrence of an additional methyl signal at d 3.80, sug-gesting that 9 was the methyl ester of 8. Therefore, 9 was de-termined to be mucic acid 1,4-lactone 6-methyl ester 5-O-gallate.Compound 10 was found to be an isomer of 6 and 8 byanalysis of the 13C-NMR spectral data and the result of posi-tive-ion FAB-MS [m/z 343, (M2H)2]. The 1H-NMR spec-trum showed a large down field shift of H-3 [d 5.73 (dd,J57.2, 6.6 Hz)] instead of H-2 of 6, indicating that the gal-loyl group was attached to the C-3 position in 10. Thus, thestructure of 10 was established as mucic acid 1,4-lactone 3-O-gallate.Compound 11 was obtained as a white amorphous powder,and its 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra revealed the presence oftwo galloyl groups (d 7.23, 7.17), and a mucic acid core.This was supported by the positive-ion FAB-MS showing the(M2H)2 peak at m/z 495. In the 1H-NMR spectrum, the sig-nals due to H-3 and H-5 were appeared at the lower field [d5.62 (dd, J57.5, 6.9 Hz) and d 5.65 (d, J51.8 Hz), respec-tively], while H-2 and H-4 signals remained at the upper field[d 5.10 (d, J57.5 Hz), d 5.14 (dd, J51.8, 6.9 Hz)]. Hence,the structure of 11 was determined to be mucic acid 1,4-lac-tone 3,5-di-O-gallate.538 Vol. 49, No. 5These mucic acid gallates were unstable in the aqueous so-lution and became an equilibrium mixture. Actually, treat-ment of 2 with H2O/MeOH (4 : 1) at room temperature for36 h afforded compounds 2—9, and 5 also gave a mixture ofcompounds 2—9 under similar conditions, confirming theequilibrium between these compounds (Fig. 1). Taking theequilibrium into account, the fact that these gallates are opti-cally active implied the occurrence of an enantiospecific gal-loylation at C-2 position of the optically inactive mucic acidin P. emblica. Interestingly, the mucic acid core of 8 corre-sponds to the enantiomer of 6.Most of the methyl esters were probably artifacts gener-ated during the separation; however, direct analysis of the60% aq. acetone extract of the juice by TLC and HPLC indi-cated the occurrence of small amounts of the methyl esters.Because of the equilibrium, purification of the mucic acidgallates was extremely difficult, and the absolute configura-tion has not been determined. Although isolation yields werenot high, HPLC analysis showed that compounds 5, 6, and 8were the major phenolic constituents of the juice togetherwith 1-O-galloyl-b-D-glucose, and these galloyl esters mayplay an important role as antioxidants in the juice togetherwith vitamin C.ExperimentalOptical rotations were measured with a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarime-ter. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded with Varian Unity plus 500 andVarian Gemini 300 spectrometers operating at 500 and 300 MHz for 1H-,and 125 and 100 MHz for 13C-, respectively. Coupling constants were ex-pressed in Hz, and chemical shifts were given on a d (ppm) scale withtetramethylsilane as an internal standard. MS were recorded on a JEOL JMSDX-303 spectrometer. Column chromatographies were performed withMCI-gel CHP 20P (75—150 mm, Mitsubishi Chemical Co.), Sephadex LH-20 (25—100 mm, Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd.), Toyopearl HW-40F(37—70 mm, Tosoh Co.), Cosmosil 75C18-OPN (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.), andChromatorex ODS (100—200 mesh, Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd.). TLC wasperformed on precoated Kieselgel 60 F254 plates (0.2 mm thick, Merck),using solvent systems of benzene–ethyl formate–formic acid (1 : 7 : 1), andspots were detected by ultraviolet (UV) illumination and by spraying 2%ethanolic ferric chloride and 10% sulfuric acid reagent. HPLC analysis wasperformed on a Tosoh CCPM solvent delivery system, a JASCO UV-970spectrometer and a Cosmosil 5C18-AR (Nacalai Tesque) column(2.5325 mm) [mobile phase, acetonitrile–50 mM H3PO4 aqueous solution(gradient elution of 0%→30% acetonitrile for 30 min); flow rate,0.8 ml/min; detection, 280 nm]. Mucic acid and D-saccharic acid 1,4-lactonewere purchased from Nacalai Tesque.Plant Material The powdered fruit juice of Phyllanthus emblica L. wasbought in Yunnan Province, China. A voucher specimen of this plant is de-posited in the Herbarium of Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academyof Sciences.Extraction and Isolation The fruit juice powder (5.0 kg) was extractedwith 60% aq. acetone four times at room temperature to give an extract(4.8 kg). A portion (920 g) of the extract was subjected to MCI gel CHP 20P(H2O–MeOH, 1 : 0—0 : 1, and 50% acetone) to afford five fractions (frac-tions 1—5). One quarter of fraction 1 was further separated successively bySephadex LH-20 (H2O–MeOH, 1 : 0—0 : 1 and then 50% acetone), MCI gelCHP 20P (H2O–MeOH, 1 : 0—0 : 1) and Toyopearl HW-40F (H2O–MeOH,1 : 0—0 : 1) to give compounds 2 (371 mg), 3 (26 mg), 11 (15 mg), gallicacid (600 mg), and 1-O-galloyl-b-D-glucose (963 mg). Since most of the re-maining compounds in this fraction were deduced to be salts and were notadsorbed by the chromatography, these compounds were combined and theaqueous solution was acidified to ca. pH 2. Repeated chromatography of themixture over Sephadex LH-20 and Cosmosil 75C18 OPN column gave com-pounds 1 (230 mg), 5 (400 mg), 4 (114 mg), 6 (122 mg), 7 (10 mg), 8 (141mg), 9 (34 mg), 10 (15 mg), and chebulic acid (35 mg).L-Malic Acid 2-O-Gallate (1) White amorphous powder, [a]D22 20.4°(c50.24, MeOH). 1H-NMR (acetone-d6, 300 MHz) d : 3.03 (1H, d,J58.1 Hz, H-3a), 3.06 (1H, d, J54.5 Hz, H-3b), 5.60 (1H, dd, J58.1,4.5 Hz, H-2), 7.17 (2H, s, galloyl H-29, 69). 13C-NMR (acetone-d6, 75 MHz)d 36.5 (C-3), 69.4 (C-2), 110.5 (galloyl C-29, 69), 120.9 (C-19), 139.1 (C-49),146.0 (C-39, 59), 165.8 (C-79), 170.6, 170.9 (COOH).

Equilibrium of Compounds 2—9 A solution of 2 (150 mg) inH2O/MeOH (4 : 1, 10 ml) was left to stand at room temperature for 36 h. Re-peated chromatography of the mixture over Sephadex LH-20 and Cosmosil75C18 OPN column afforded compounds 3 (20 mg), 4 (17 mg), 5 (30 mg), 6(10 mg), 7 (3 mg), 8 (30 mg), 9 (7 mg), and a recovery of 2 (14 mg). Thesecompounds were identified by comparison of the 1H-, 13C-NMR spectraldata and the [a]D values with those of the authentic samples. A similar ex-periment was also carried out for compound 5: a solution of 5 (1 mg) inH2O/MeOH (4 : 1, 10 ml) was left to stand at room temperature for 48 h andit became a mixture of compounds 2—9, which were identified directly byTLC comparison with the authentic samples (benzene–ethyl formate–formicacid, 1 : 7 : 1).Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Mr. K.
