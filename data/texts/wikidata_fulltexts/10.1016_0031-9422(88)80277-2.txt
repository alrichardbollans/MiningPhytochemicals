Abstract-Three chalcones, two /?-hydroxychalcones, four flavanones, SIX flavones, four flavonols, one rotenold and one pterocarpan were isolated from the roots of Dahlstedt~~ pinnata and D. pentaphylla. With the exception of the pterocarpan, all the compounds exhibit prenylation m the A ring, a characteristic of flavonolds produced by species of the Tephrosieae Of the 21 flavonoids Identified, five (2 flavanones and 3 flavones) are new as naturally occurrmg compounds. A neat dlstinctlon m the biosynthetic capability of the two species, leading to the production of flavanones and flavonols in D pentaphylla, but not m D. pinnaca, is observed. In this latter species, blosynthesls IS totally oriented toward dehydrogenatlon, producmg flavones. By both cntena-higher oxldatlon state and suppres- sion of enzyme systems--l) pinnata 1s the more advanced speaes. INTRODUCTION Prenylated flavonoids are characteristic constituents of a number of Legummosae genera in the subfamdy Papllio- noideae, such as Derris, Lonchocarpus, Mzlletza, Mun- dulea, Pzsczdza, Pongamia and Tephrosza. Bentham [l] stressed the difficulty of neatly distingulshmg these gen- era and this difficulty was acknowledged by most sub- sequent workers. Engler [2] placed them in two tribes Dalbergiae, subtribe Lonchocarpmae; and Astragalae, subtribes Tephrosmae and Psoralemae Hutchmson [3] distributed them over four tnbes: Mllletleae, Lonchocar- peae, Tephrosleae and Psoraheae. Polhlll and Geesmk [4], on the other hand, united these genera mto a single tribe, Tephrosleae, a declslon maintained by Geesink [S], under Milletleae. Dahlstedtza Malme, which has not previously been investigated chemically, belongs to this same complex. It IS an exclusively Brazihan genus with only two known species: D. pinnata (Benth) Malme [6] and D. penta- phylla (Taub.) Burk. [7] Both have their centre of dis- persion in the southern State of Santa Catarma, to which the latter species seems to be restricted, whereas D pznnata can also be found further to the north, occasion- ally as far as Rio de Janeiro, Mmas Gerals and Go& In the present paper we describe the isolation and identification of 19 prenylated flavonolds from the roots of the two mentioned speaes, apart from two lsoflavon- oids (one rotenoid and one non-prenylated pterocarpan) * Present address Departamento de Quimlca, Umversldade Federal do Mato Gross0 do Sul, Calxa postal 649, 79 100 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil t Present address. Centro Naclonal de Pesqmsa de Defesa da Agrlcultura, EMBRAPA, Caixa postal 69, 13 280 Jaguarmna, SP, Brazil Only two of these components-one.chalcone, 1, and one flavone, 7, were isolated from both species. Five are described for the first time as naturally occurrmg sub- stances. This prolific presence of compounds of a peculiar type m one small genus offers an mterestmg overvlew allowmg for a number of conclusions with regard to blogenetlc and evolutionary aspects, based on the meta- bolic pathways which govern the synthesis of these secondary products. RESULTSANDDISCUSSION Charts 1 and 2 show the 21 identified flavonold consti- tuents of the two Dahlstedtza species Their structures were deduced by spectral methods Most of the com- pounds were known previously from plants in other genera of the tribe. Their names and the correspondmg hterature references are mdlcated m the Experimental Sectlon. Flavones 3,4 and 12 and the flavanone 13 have been described as transformation products of the corres- ponding chalcones Consequently, 13 was known only as the optlcally inactive racemate Only flavanone 15 1s new. Thus, almost all the structures, deduced from the spectral analysis, could be confirmed by comparison with physl- cal constants and spectral data contained in the litera- ture. Inspection of the structures leads to a number of Interesting deductions with regard to the synthetic se- quences leading to the final products It 1s understood, of course, that the plants produce not only those com- pounds which could be isolated, but all intermediates on the synthetic route as well, such as would be expected to fill m the steps in the accepted biogenetic pathways Comparison of the structural features with each Chart allows for the followmg conclusions: (i) all modlficatlons mcldental to ring A occur at least at the chalcone stage of biosynthesis. 0-Methylatlon and, m the case of the re- 1079 1080 F R GARCEZ et al R2 I R= y$pR3 op?fY 0 1 R’=OMe,R’=R’=H R’ 0 2 R’=OMe,R’=R”=H 3 R’=OMe, R’+R3=-0CH20- 4 R’= H, R’+R’=-OCH,O- 5 R’ZRZZR3ZH 6 R1=H,~2+R3=-O~H20- R’ 0 7 R’=R’=R’=H 8 R’=H, R2+R3=-C-CH20- 'OMe 9 Compounds 3 and 4 have not previously been descrtbed as natural products Chart I Flavonold constituents of Duhl~bvft~a ~mmta sorcmoi oxydatlon pattern, eflmmatlon of-the hydroxyi group at C-6’ may happen even earlier, before cychz- atlon, on the open polyketlde cham Prenylatlon occurs after cychzatlon, since otherwise the C, substltuent would lsomerlze to a A’-lsopentenyl group [S], (II) Formation of B-hydroxychalcones (dlbenzoylmethanes, e g 5 and 6) 1s condltloned to the absence of a hydroxyl group sultable for closure of the pyrone rmg (ehmmatlon at C-6’; O-methyiatlon at C-I’); (in) Where both C’--2’and’ C-6’ are oxygenated (phloroglucmol type) cychzatlon of the prenyl substltuent toward the ‘hnear’ dlsposltlon of the pyranochromene system (as found m many instances m Pongam~) rather than the ‘angular’ one (the only one present m Duhlstedtr~r) IS also determined by the O- methylatlon pattern Altogether, one observes a neat dlstmctlon m the syn- thetic capability of the two Duhlstedrm species Thus, D pentuphyllu operates the complete blogenetrc sequence of flavonold blosynthesls up to flavanones and flavonols In D pznnatu, on the other hand, blosynthesls IS totally oriented toward dehydrogenatlon, producmg flavones as final products By both criteria-higher oxydatlon state and suppression of enzyme actlvlty --D pmnata is the evolutionary more advanced species DIscussIon of the ‘H and 13C NMR spectra of com- pounds 5 and 6 with a view on the structures mvolved rn the respective keto-enol tautomerlsm m chloroform solution was the object of a previous paper [9] The 13C spectra of a larger number of flavonolds, mcludmg the compounds here described, will be presented and dls- cussed m a torthcommg pubilcation An expansion of‘the method of reasoning here applied to the phylogenetlc relatlonshlp between the two Dnhlsredtlu species to other genera of the tribe IS bemg attempted EXPERlMEh IAL Root material of D pnnatn and 11 pvntaphylla was collected m the State of Santa Catarma, m the mumclpahties or Morretea and Rodelo, respectlveiy Voucher specimens are deposlted at the Museu Botimco Municlpdi m Curltlba, Parani Mps are uncorr UV spectra were obtamed m MeOH or 95% EtOH dnd IR Fpectra m KBr pellets ‘H NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz m CDCI, with TMS as mt standard.
