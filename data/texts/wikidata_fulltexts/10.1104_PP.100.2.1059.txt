ABSTRACT
A new allelopathic substance that promoted the shoot growth of
different plant species but inhibited the root growth was isolated
as an amorphous powder from mucilage of germinated cress (Lep-
idium sativum L.) seeds. This substance was identified as sodium
2-O-rhamnopyranosyl-4-deoxy-threo-hex-4-enopyranosiduronate
(designated lepidimoide) from the mass and the nuclear magnetic
resonance and infrared spectra coupled with some chemical evi-
dence. Lepidimoide promoted the hypocotyl growth of etiolated
Amaranthus caudatus L. at concentrations higher than 3 gM and
inhibited the root growth at concentrations higher than 100 gM.
The growth-promoting activity in hypocotyls was 20 or 30 times as
much as that of gibberellic acid.
The term 'allelopathy' was coined by Molisch (4) to refer
to both detrimental and beneficial biochemical interactions
among all classes of plants, including microorganisms. When
seeds of several different species of plants or etiolated seed-
lings were cultured together with cress seeds in a Petri dish,
shoot growth of the plants was significantly promoted by
cress seeds, but root growth was inhibited. The growth of
cress seedlings was not influenced by cress seeds (2; Fig. 1).
The allelopathy was not caused by contact with cress seeds,
but was due to the mucilage of the germinated cress seeds,
since seeds or seedlings of different species placed apart from
the cress seeds on an agar plate also showed the effect (2).
Longman and Callow (3) and Ray et al. (5) reported that the
mucilage of germinated cress seeds contained the polysac-
charides that reduced binding of Pythium aphanidermatum to
cress roots. However, our recent studies demonstrated that
the allelopathic substance(s), the Mr of which was below 5 x
103, was different from the mucilage polysaccharides (1).
In this article, we report isolation and identification of an
allelopathic substance from mucilage of germinated cress
seeds and also report on some preliminary aspects of its
biological activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material
Three thousand cress seeds (Lepidium sativum L.) were
allowed to imbibe in distilled-deionized H20 for 1 h and put
on a stainless steel net (3 mm mesh) in a stainless steel tray
(40 x 40 x 3 cm3) containing 1.6 L of H20. The seeds on the
net, in contact with the H20, were cultured at 250C in the
dark for 2 d. The culture solution was aerated with an air
pump during the culture period.
Purification
The culture solution was filtered through Toyo No. 1 filter
paper and evaporated to dryness in vacuo at 350C. The
concentrate was divided into acetone-soluble and -insoluble
fractions. The biological activity of growth promotion of
Amaranthus caudatus L. hypocotyls and growth inhibition of
the roots was detected in the acetone-insoluble fraction. This
fraction was dissolved in 10 mL of H20 and was then
fractionated into three parts, of Mr above 105, from 105 to 5
X 103, and below 5 x 103 by molecular exclusion chromatog-
raphy (Mol cut, Millipore Corp.). The biological activity was
detected in the fraction of Mr below 5 x 103, and this was
evaporated to dryness in vacuo at 350C.
HPLC
The concentrate (approximately 150 mg) dissolved in H20
was purified by reverse phase HPLC (Waters, ,uBondasphere
5 ,um C18-100A; 19 mm x 15 cm; 100% H20, flow rate 5
mL/min; 214 nm detector). The biological activity was found
in fractions with retention times of 5 to 8 min. The eluate
was concentrated in vacuo at 350C and further purified by a
second HPLC step (YMC Packed Column AQ-324 S-5 120A
ODS; YMC Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan; 100% H20, 1 mL/min,
214 nm detector). The eluate at retention time 17.0 to 17.8
min showed biological activity and was evaporated to dryness
in vacuo at 350C. It gave 6.5 mg of an amorphous powder.
We checked whether its occurrence could be ascribed to
contamination by microorganisms, but this was not found to
be the case. The activity could also be detected in mucilage

Spectrometric Analyses
Optical rotation was determined with a JASCO DIP-360
polarimeter. The IR spectrum was obtained in glycerol with
a JASCO A-202 spectrophotometer. The UV spectrum in D20
was obtained with a JASCO UVIDEC-610A spectrophotom-
eter. The 'H NMR spectrum was taken on a JEOL JNM-
GX400 NMR spectrometer, and the fast atom bombardment
mass spectrum was recorded in glycerol matrix.
Bioassay
Ten seeds of A. caudatus L. were placed on filter paper
moistened with 0.8 mL of test solutions in a 3-cm Petri dish.
Petri dishes were kept in the dark at 250C for 5 d, and then
hypocotyl length was measured.
The 5-mm coleoptile sections of 3-d-old etiolated oat (Av-
ena sativa L. cv Victory) seedlings were incubated in 1%
sucrose solution (pH 5.4) containing various concentrations
of lepidimoide for 6 h at 250C in the dark. After incubation,
the length of each section was measured.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Determination of Isolated Compound
Lepidimoide (Fig. 2) was isolated as an amorphous powder
from mucilage of germinated cress seeds. The high resolution
FAB mass spectrum showed an M+ + Na peak at m/z
367.0591, indicating a molecular formula of C12H17010Na2
(A - 2.6 molecular mass units). Its optical rotation [a]19 was
+87.8 (c 0.032, D20). Its IR spectrum revealed the presence
of a carboxylate group (1590 cm-') and a hydroxyl group
(3300 cm-'). 'H NMR (D20) spectral data were as follows:
65.72 (1H, d, I = 3.2 Hz, j), 5.17 (1H, d, I = 1.6 Hz, a), 5.07
(1H, d, I = 2.3 Hz, g), 4.26 (1H, dd, J = 6.9, 3.2 Hz, i), 4.08
(1H, dd, I = 3.4, 1.6 Hz, b), 3.79 (1H, dq, J = 9.7, 6.8 Hz, e),
3.76 (1H, dd, I = 9.7, 3.4 Hz, c), 3.72 (1H, dd, J = 6.9, 2.3
Hz, h), 3.31 (1H, dd, I = 9.7, 9.7 Hz, d) and 1.80 (3H, d, I =
6.8 Hz, f), where lower case letters refer to corresponding
groups in Figure 2. The UV spectrum was Xmax 225 nm
(E approximately 2100).
When treated with acetic anhydride-pyridine-methanol at
room temperature overnight, lepidimoide was converted into
the corresponding methyl ester with five acetoxy groups, the
mass spectrum of which indicated that the molecular formula
was C23H30015 (m/z 546.1564 [M+]). The IR spectrum indi-
cated no hydroxyl absorption and, in the 'H NMR (CDCl3)
spectrum, exhibited signals for five acetoxyl methyl protons
(6 2.00 [3H, s], 2.05 [3H, s], 2.10 [3H, s], and 2.14 [3H x
2, s]) and a signal for the methoxyl proton (b 3.88 [3H, s]).
The nuclear Overhauser effect experiments with the methyl
ester gave valuable data. Irradiation at 6 5.17 (H of a) in-
creased 7.3 and 8.3% of the intensity of H of b and H of g,
respectively. Irradiation at 5 5.07 (H of g) increased 8.3, 6.9,
and 13.6% of the intensity of H of a, b, and h, respectively.
These data indicated the structure of lepidimoide to be so-
dium 2-O-rhamnopyranosyl-4-deoxy-threo-hex-4-enopyra-
nosiduronate (Fig. 2).

Biological Activity of Lepidimoide
The effects of lepidimoide, GA3, and IAA on the growth
of etiolated A. caudatus L. seedlings were demonstrated (Fig.
3). Lepidimoide promoted hypocotyl growth at concentra-
tions higher than 3 ,M, but inhibited root growth at concen-
trations higher than 100 ,uM. It is suggested that lepidimoide
may render many different plant species susceptible to
growth retardation. The promotion of hypocotyl growth by
lepidimoide was 20 to 30 times as much as that produced by
GA3 treatment, suggesting that lepidimoide was a potent
growth substance. The growth inhibition of roots by lepidi-
moide was not significantly different from that shown by
GA3. IAA inhibited hypocotyl and root growth of Amaranthus
seedlings. On the other hand, lepidimoide showed no auxin
activity in the Avena coleoptile section test (data not shown).
These results suggest the possibility that cress plants may
protect themselves by exuding from roots an allelopathic
substance (lepidimoide) and polysaccharides (1, 3, 5), which

affect the growth or differentiation of different plant species
and microorgamnsms.
