Microsomal membrane preparations from the developing endosperm of castor bean (Ricinus communis) catalysed the
transfer of oleate from ['4C]oleoyl-CoA to phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). In the presence of NADH, radioactive
ricinoleate (12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoate) was synthesized from [14C]oleate, and this was largely recovered in PtdCho and
as free fatty acid. The addition of unlabelled ricinoleoyl-CoA to these incubation mixtures did not increase the low
[14C]ricinoleate concentration found in the acyl-CoA fraction nor decrease the [14C]ricinoleate concentration in PtdCho
and free fatty acid, and thus no evidence was obtained for a hydroxylation with oleoyl-CoA as a substrate. The addition
of NADH, necessary for the formation of ricinoleate, caused a decrease of the total radioactivity in PtdCho with a
corresponding increase in the amount of label in free ricinoleic acid. This increase was due to the action of a phospholipase
A, which released ricinoleic acid but not oleic acid from PtdCho. Such a phospholipase activity, attacking ricinoleoyl-
PtdCho but not oleoyl-PtdCho, was also demonstrated in microsomal preparations from developing cotyledons of
safflower and oil-seed rape. An analysis of the acyl groups at different positions in microsomal PtdCho of castor bean
showed that ricinoleate was almost entirely associated with position sn-2. Likewise the [14C]ricinoleate in [14C]PtdCho
formed after incubations with microsomal preparations with NADH and [14C]oleoyl-CoA resided in position sn-2 with
none in position sn-l. In contrast, the [14C]linoleate formed by desaturation of [14C]oleoyl-PtdCho was present at both
positions. In the presence of ATP, CoA and Mg2", the ricinoleate acid released from PtdCho was activated to ricinoleoyl-
CoA. The ricinoleoyl-CoA was an efficient acyl donor in the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate (Gro3P) to yield
phosphatidic acid and triacylglycerols. In microsomal preparations incubated with an equimolar mixture of [14C]oleoyl-
CoA and [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA in the presence of Gro3P, only a minor amount of [14C]ricinoleate entered PtdCho, and
this was believed to be via the exchange of phosphocholine groups between a diacylglycerol pool and the PtdCho. On the
basis of our results, a scheme of ricinoleate formation and its incorporation into triacylglycerols in castor-bean endosperm
is proposed.
INTRODUCTION
Vegetable oils rich in ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxyoctadeca-9-
enoic acid) are of particular interest to the oleochemical industry
(Pryde & Rothfus, 1989). Few plants species, however, ac-
cumulate triacylglycerols (triacylglycerides) with hydroxylated
fatty acids. The only commercial source is from castor-bean
(Ricinus communis) endosperm, in which over 80% of the fatty
acid in the triacylglycerol is ricinoleic acid. Earlier work (Galliard
& Stumpf, 1966), with cell-free and microsomal membrane
preparations from developing castor beans, showed that oleate
(C18.1 AS) was the acyl substrate for the hydroxylation and that
the reaction required NAD(P)H. Kinetic data (Moreau &
Stumpf, 1981), on ricinoleate formation from exogenously sup-
plied ['4C]oleoyl-CoA, were interpreted as indicating that the
oleate was esterified to microsomal phosphatidylcholine (Ptd-
Cho) before hydroxylation. In these experiments, however, little
[14C]ricinoleate wUs found in PtdCho, the major portion being
present in an undefined 'non-polar' fraction. Questions, there-
fore, regarding the immediate substrate for the A12-fatty acid
hydroxylase and the assembly of triacylglycerol with hydroxy
fatty acids remain largely unresolved (Stymne & Stobart, 1987).
Here we present evidence on the nature of the lipid substrate for
the hydroxylase enzyme and investigate ricinoleate utilization in
triacylglycerol formation in microsomal preparations from the
developing endosperm of castor bean.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
[1-14C]Oleic acid and sn-[U-14C]glycerol 3-phosphate ([U-
14C]Gro3P) were obtained from Amersham International,
Amersham, Bucks., U.K. Catalase, BSA (fraction V, fatty acid-
free), triacylglycerol lipase (Rhizopus arrhizus), CoA, Gro3P,
lysophosphatidylcholine (sn-l-acylglycero-3-phosphocholine)
(lysoPtdCho) (prepared from egg yolk), oleic acid and ricinoleic
acid were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co.
[1_-4C]Ricinoleic acid was synthesized enzymically by hy-
droxylation of [1-14C]oleate by microsomal preparations from
developing castor-bean endosperm as follows. Microsomal prep-
aration (10 mg of microsomal protein) was incubated for 4 h at
25 °C with 1 jiTnol of [1-14C]oleic acid (sp. radioactivity 52 ,uCi/
,umol) bound to 80 mg of BSA, 8000 units of catalase, 15 ,umol of
NADH, 16 ,umol of ATP, 18 ,umol of MgCl2 and 8 ,mol of CoA
in 0.1 M-potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in a total volume of
8 ml. The lipids were saponified by heating the mixture in 0.5 M-
KOH at 100 °C for 60 min. After acidification with HCI and
extraction with chloroform, the fatty acids were esterified with

methanolic HCl (Kates, 1964). The methyl ricinoleate was
separated from the non-hydroxylated methyl esters by t.l.c. on
silica gel 60 with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30: 1, by
vol.). The area corresponding to methyl ricinoleate was removed
from the plates and the lipid was eluted from the gel with
chloroform/methanol (2: 1, v/v). The solvent was evaporated,
and the methyl esters were saponified with 1 ml of 2 M-KOH at
100 °C for 60 min. After acidification with HC1, the free [14C]-
ricinoleic acid was extracted in chloroform. The yield of [14C]-
ricinoleate was about 20% of added radioactivity and the final
specific radioactivity was 12500 d.p.m./nmol. Radiolabelled and
non-labelled oleoyl-CoA and ricinoleoyl-CoA were synthesized
from their mixed anhydrides (Sainchez et al., 1973; Stobart &
Stymne, 1990).
Plant material and microsomal preparation
Microsomal preparations from developing cotyledons of oil-
seed rape (Brassica napus var. Topas) and safflower (Carthamus
tinctorius var. Gila) were prepared by the procedure of Stobart &
Stymne (1990). Castor bean (Ricinus communis var. Rogusus)
plants were grown from seed in a 16 h photoperiod at 25 °C and
8 h night at 20 'C. Developing seeds were harvested between 30
and 40 days after flowering and cut into two parts. Only those
seeds where the endosperm had expanded to between one-third
and two-thirds of the seed volume were used for microsomal
preparation. The endosperm tissues, together with the small
embryo, were removed from the seed and stored on ice. All
further manipulations were carried out at 0 'C. The tissue was
ground in a mortar with 5 parts (v/w) of 0.1 M-potassium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% BSA, 1000 units of
catalase/ml and 0.33 M-sucrose. The homogenate was filtered
through a double layer of Miracloth, diluted 10-fold with fresh
grinding medium and centrifuged at 20000 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was filtered through Miracloth and centrifuged at
105 000 g for 90 min. The resulting microsomal pellet was re-
suspended in 0.1 M-potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, con-
taining 0.1 % of BSA and 1000 units of catalase/ml. The
microsomal pellets were used either fresh or stored up to 2 weeks
at -80 'C. Longer storage periods greatly decreased the oleate
hydroxylation activity of the preparation.
Protein determination
Protein was measured with the BCA protein reagent (Pierce
Chemical Co). after treatment of the microsomal preparation
with 0.1 % SDS and with BSA as standard.
Assays
Microsomal incubations with radioactive substrates were car-
ried out with constant shaking at 25 'C and with acyl-CoAs, acyl
acceptors, cofactors and microsomal membranes (as given in the
Table and Figure legends) and 1000 units of catalase in a final
volume of 1 ml with 0.1 M-sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2.
Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 0.15 M-
acetic acid, and the complex lipids and non-esterified fatty acids
were extracted by the addition of 3.75 ml of methanol/
chloroform (2:1, v/v) and 1.25 ml of chloroform as modified
from the method of Bligh & Dyer (1959).
Analytical procedures
When the analysis of the acyl groups in the acyl-CoA fraction
was required, the upper methanol/water phase (into which the
acyl-CoA partitions) from the Bligh & Dyer (1959) extraction
were extracted further with an additional 2.5 ml of chloroform.
The lower chloroform phases were bulked and used for the
analysis of complex lipids and non-esterified fatty acids as de-
scribed below. Acyl-CoA in the aqueous-methanol phase was
hydrolysed by the addition of 2 ml of 2 M-KOH and refluxed for
40 min. After acidification with HC1, the resulting non-esterified
fatty acids were extracted in chloroform. After evaporation of
the chloroform under N2, the fatty acids were methylated with
methanolic HCI (Kates, 1964) and, after the addition of methyl-
heptadecanoic acid as internal standard, analysed by g.l.c.
and radio-g.l.c. Although all the acyl-CoA was recovered by this
method, a minor part of the microsomal lipids also partitioned
into the upper phase (1-2% oftotal acyl groups in the microsomal
membranes).
Complex lipids and non-esterified fatty acids in the chloroform
phase were evaporated to dryness under N2. The residue was
dissolved in a small volume of chloroform, and the polar lipids
were purified by t.l.c. on precoated silica-gel plates (Merck; silica
gel 60) with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (170:
30:20:7, by vol.). Neutral lipids were purified on high-per-
formance t.l.c. plates (Merck; silica gel 60) in hexane/diethyl
ether/acetic acid (70:140:3, by vol.).
The presence of ricinoleoyl groups in complex lipids affected
their mobility in the t.l.c. system. The presence of ricinoleate in the
polar lipids had much less influence on the migration rate than
the ricinoleate in neutral lipids. PtdCho with one ricinoleoyl
group co-chromatographed with PtdCho without hydroxylated
acyl groups, whereas phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) with one
ricinoleoyl moiety was only partially resolved from PtdOH with
two ricinoleoyl groups and with no ricinoleate. In the neutral
lipids (i.e. the non-esterified fatty acid, monoacylglycerols, di-
acylglycerols and triacylglycerols) the presence of ricinoleate
dramatically altered their chromatographic behaviour. The use

Ricinoleate biosynthesis in castor beans
of high-performance silica-gel t.l.c. plates in the solvent described
above enabled the resolution of all these lipids according to the
number of hydroxylated acyl groups present in each lipid class
(Fig. 1). The different hydroxylated lipids were identified by first
analysing the acyl composition of the three major lipid areas on
a t.l.c. chromatogram of castor-bean oil. The proportion of
ricinoleoyl groups in the three areas were (in order of decreasing
mass in each area) 100, 66 and 33 % of total acyl groups, and
thus they consisted of triacylglycerols with three, two and one
ricinoleoyl group respectively. Triacylglycerols with two ricin-
oleoyl groups were eluted from the gel and partially hydrolysed
with RPizopus arrhizus lipase by the procedure of Bafor et al.
(1990). After chromatography of the hydrolytic products an
additional five lipid spots were observed. Two were identified as
free ricinoleic acid and free non-hydroxylated fatty acids, and the
others, with a migration value less than the triacylglycerols
substrate, were on the basis of ricinoleate content tentatively
identified as ricinoleoyl-containing monoacylglycerols, ricino-
leoyl/ricinoleoyl-containing diacylglycerols and ricinoleoyl/
non-hydroxylated acyl-containing diacylgly,erol.
Lipid areas were removed from the plates and either assayed
for radioactivity or esterified in situ with methanolic HCI (Kates,
1964) for the analysis of the fatty acids. The unlabelled and
radioactive fatty acid methyl esters were analysed by g.l.c. and
radio-g.l.c. respectively.
Positional analysis of the PtdCho was performed after treat-
ment of the lipid with phospholipase A2 as described by Griffiths
et al. (1985).
Lipid samples were assayed for radioactivity in PCS (Amer-
sham-Searle)/xylene (2: 1, v/v) scintillant in an LKB 1214 liquid-
scintillation counter with an efficiency of about 94 % for the 14C.
All values were corrected for background and quenching.
RESULTS
Hydroxylation of 1[4Cloleate
Microsomal preparations from developing castor-bean endo-
sperm were incubated with ['4C]oleoyl-CoA and NADH and
the distribution of radioactivity in complex lipids and non-
esterified fatty acids was determined (Table 1). In the absence of
NADH the oleate was transferred largely to PtdCho with little
radioactivity in the non-esterified fatty acids. The addition of
NADH, however, resulted in the appearance of the radioactive
free ricinoleic acid and with a corresponding decrease in the label
in PtdCho. Time-course studies on the incorporation of radio-
activity from [14CJoleoyl-CoA into lipid species in the presence of
NADH showed (Fig. 2) that [14C]oleate from [14C]oleoyl-CoA
was mainly transferred to PtdCho. Total amount of [14C]-
ricinoleate increased throughout the time course. Similar quan-
tities of [14C]ricinoleate accumulated in PtdCho and free fatty
acid up to 30 min of incubation, after which the amount remained
constant in PtdCho but continued to increase in the free acid. It
should be noted that after 60 min incubation 80% of the
[14C]ricinoleate in the chloroform-soluble lipids resided in free
fatty acid. In contrast, [14C]linoleate, formed by Al2-fatty acid
desaturase activity, was almost totally associated with PtdCho
(Fig. 2a). The accumulation of ['4C]oleate as free fatty acid was
only 25 % of that found for free ['4C]ricinoleic acid (results not
shown).
In order to establish if oleoyl-CoA could serve as a direct
substrate for the hydroxylase, relatively high concentrations of
unlabelled ricinoleoyl-CoA were added to microsomal membrane
preparations incubated with [14C]oleoyl-CoA and NADH and
the specific radioactivity of the ricinoleate in the lipid fractions
was determined. The rationale for this experiment was that, if

3 ,umol of NADH and 1000 units of catalase in 0.1 M-phosphate

ricinoleoyl-CoA were the product of hydroxylation, the un-
labelled ricinoleoyl-CoA should dilute substantially the specific
radioactivity of the [14Clricinoleoyl-CoA formed from [14C]-
oleoyl-CoA. This would drastically decrease the [14C]ricinoleate
in the chloroform-soluble lipids (PtdCho and non-esterified fatty
acids) and correspondingly greater amounts of [14C]ricinoleate
should reside in the acyl-CoA fraction. The results (Table 2),
however, showed that the addition of unlabelled ricinoleoyl-CoA
somewhat increased the [14C]ricinoleate in PtdCho and free fatty
acid and decreased the small amount of [14C]ricinoleate in the
acyl-CoA fraction. It should be noted that some two-thirds of the

added ricinoleoyl-CoA still remained at the end of the incubation
period.
Castor-bean microsomal membranes efficiently catalysed the
acylation of exogenously supplied lysoPtdCho with ricinoleate
from ['4C]ricinoleoyl-CoA (see below and Fig. 4). The acylation
of PtdCho in vivo in oil-seeds, however, may occur largely via an
acyl-exchange between an acyl-CoA pool and position sn-2 of
sn-PtdCho (Stymne & Stobart, 1984, 1987). This reaction
was therefore studied in castor-bean microsomal preparations
incubated with oleoyl-CoA and ricinoleoyl-CoA as single and
mixed acyl-CoA substrates and in the absence of added lyso-
PtdCho. The results (Fig. 3) showed that the ricinoleate was
incorporated into PtdCho but at a much lower rate (20 %) than
observed for the oleate. Little incorporation of [14C]ricinoleate
into PtdCho was observed in incubations with mixed acyl-CoA
substrates, in which [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA and unlabelled oleoyl-
CoA were provided in equimolar amounts (Fig. 3).
The sn-distribution of fatty acids in sn-PtdCho before and
after a 60 min incubation of microsomal membranes with [14C]-
oleoyl-CoA and NADH was determined (Table 3). The sn-
PtdCho in pre-incubation membranes contained some 9%
ricinoleate in position sn-2, whereas this acid was only present in
trace amounts at position sn-i. After incubation the mass of
ricinoleate had increased to 20% and 3 % at positions sn-2 and
sn-I respectively. Over 84% of the radioactivity incorporated
into sn-PtdCho during incubation was confined to position sn-2,
of which 46% was in ricinoleate. No radioactive ricinoleate was
detected in position sn-i, whereas substantial [14C]linoleate was
present at both the sn-I and sn-2 positions.
Metabolism of PtdCho
The results described strongly indicate that the A12-fatty acid
hydroxylase uses as substrate the oleate at position sn-2 of
microsomal sn-PtdCho. The major proportion of synthesized
ricinoleate at prolonged incubation times, however, was found
to reside in free ricinoleic acid. These observations imply the

PtdCho was labelled with either [14C]ricinoleate (i) or ['4C]oleate (ii) by incubating the microsomal preparations (equivalent to 0.6 mg of
microsomal protein) with [4C]ricinoleoyl-CoA or ["4C]oleoyl-CoA (40 nmol; sp. radioactivity 8000 d.p.m./nmol) respectively in the presence of

existence of a phospholipase that rapidly releases the ricinoleic
acid from PtdCho. The existence of such a phospholipase was
investigated further. Microsomal membranes incubated with
[14C]oleoyl-CoA or [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA in the presence of
supplied lyso-PtdCho became rapidly enriched with sn-2-[14C]-
oleoyl-PtdCho and sn-2-[14C]ricinoleoyl-PtdCho respectively
(Fig. 4a). After 10min incubation 84% and 70% of the
radioactivity in the chloroform-soluble lipids was found in
[14C]oleoyl-PtdCho and [14C]ricinoleoyl-PtdCho respectively. No
further significant increase occurred in radioactivity in the
chloroform phase up to 160 min of incubation, indicating that
essentially all the radioactive acyl-CoA substrate was utilized in
the first 10 min of incubation. The further distribution of
radioactivity in lipids with longer incubation times was in-
vestigated. In incubations with [14C]ricinoleate the radioactivity
in PtdCho decreased with an almost concomitant increase in the
free [14C]ricinoleic acid and, to a lesser extent, in the triacyl-
glycerol (Fig. 4a, i). In similar incubations with [14CJoleoyl-
CoA the radioactivity in PtdCho exhibited only a slight decrease
with incubation and with little increase in the free [14C]oleic acid
(Fig. 4a, ii).
The results therefore indicate that castor-bean endosperm has
a phospholipase activity that exhibits acyl-specificity and is
responsible for the release of ricinoleic acid from PtdCho. Is this
phospholipase activity confined to ricinoleic acid-synthesizing
species such as castor bean? To assess this possibility, similar
experiments were carried out with microsomal preparations from
other oil-seed species that do not synthesize ricinoleic acid, i.e.
oil-seed rape and safflower. The results (Figs. 4b and 4c) show
that both species, as in the case ofcastor bean, rapidly synthesized
[14C]ricinoleoyl-PtdCho and [14C]oleoyl-PtdCho from [14C]-
ricinoleoyl-CoA and [14C]oleoyl-CoA respectively in the presence
of lyso-PtdCho. The distribution of radioactivity with further
incubation showed similar patterns to that found in the castor-
bean preparations. The only noteworthy difference among these
three species was in the radioactivity lost from [14C]ricinoleoyl-
PtdCho and not found in free ricinoleic acid. In castor bean and
safflower this radioactivity was recovered in triacylglycerol
whereas in oil-seed rape it largely accumulated in diacylglycerol.

Triacylglycerol assembly with ricinoleate
The utilization, in triacylglycerol biosynthesis, of the ricinoleic
acid liberated from position sn-2 ofsn-PtdCho by the acyl-specific
phospholipase activity will require its activation to the CoA
ester. Microsomal membranes were incubated with [14C]oleoyl-
CoA and NADH together with the necessary cofactors for an
acyl-CoA synthetase (i.e. ATP, CoA and Mg2+). Unlabelled
ricinoleoyl-CoA was added also to the incubation mixture in
order to trap the [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA synthesized. In the pres-
ence of cofactors for fatty acid activation the radioactivity
recovered in ['4C]ricinoleoyl-CoA was over 2-fold that found in
incubations minus cofactors (Table 4). The radioactivity in the
free ricinoleic acid, on the other hand, decreased in the presence
of fatty acid activation by a similar amount (Table 4). The

Microsomal preparations (equivalent to 0.3 mg of microsomal

ricinoleoyl-CoA (b) in the presence of sn-[(4CJGro3P (1 ,umol, sp.

['4C]ricinoleate recovered in PtdCho was similar for both in-
cubations (Table 4).
Microsomal preparations incubated with [14C]Gro3P and
either ricinoleoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA efficiently acylated the
glycerol backbone to yield radioactive PtdOH, PtdCho and
triacylglycerol. In time-course studies (Fig. 5) with ricinoleoyl-
CoA the rate of accumulation of 14C-labelled triacylglycerol was
over twice that observed with oleoyl-CoA as acyl donor. In the
presence of oleoyl-CoA, however, considerably more radioactive
PtdOH and PtdCho accumulated. It should also be noted that
with oleoyl-CoA a small, but significant, amount of radioactivity
was associated with the diacylglycerol, whereas virtually no label
was detected in this lipid with ricinoleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor.
At 80 min of incubation and with oleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor,
87% of the radioactivity in triacylglycerol was present in
molecular species lacking ricinoleate with the other 13 % in
species with one ricinoleoyl moiety only (results not shown). The
radioactivity in the triacylglycerols synthesized with ricinoleoyl-
CoA as acyl donor was, at 80 min incubation, distributed mainly
in molecular species with three and two ricinoleoyl moieties
(65 % and 32% respectively) and with the remaining radioactivity
in species with only one ricinoleoyl group (results not shown).
To investigate further the acylating properties of the glycerol-
acylating activity observed in the castor-bean preparations,
microsomal membranes were incubated with unlabelled Gro3P
and a mixed [14C]acyl-CoA substrate that consisted of equimolar
['4C]oleoyl-CoA and [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA. Under these condi-
tions, PtdCho and triacylglycerol were rapidly labelled whereas
relatively little radioactivity entered PtdOH and the di-
acylglycerol (Fig. 6a). At the most, only 30% of the radioactivity
found in the PtdOH was, at all incubation times, in molecular
species with hydroxylated acyl groups (results not shown). Also,
only a minor part of the radioactivity in diacylglycerol was
associated with species containing ricinoleate (results not shown).

showed that up to 15 % of the radioactivity was associated with
[14C]ricinoleate (results not shown). Most of the radioactivity
found in the triacylglycerol was associated with molecular species
with two ricinoleoyl groups (75 %), and species with one ricin-
oleoyl moiety accumulated somewhat more activity than those
with only ricinoleate or only oleate (Fig. 6b). It should be noted
that analysis of the radioactive distribution of the acyl groups in
the different molecular species of the triacylglycerols gave the
same proportions of [14C]oleate to [14C]ricinoleate as the total
ricinoleate to total non-hydroxylated fatty acid in the lipid
species as deduced from their migration values on t.l.c. (see the
Materials and methods section).
DISCUSSION
Microsomal membrane preparations from the developing
endosperm of castor bean catalysed the transfer of oleate from
['4C]oleoyl-CoA to PtdCho. In the presence of NADH radio-
active ricinoleate was synthesized from oleate, and this largely
accumulated in neutral lipid, thus confirming previous observa-
tions (Moreau & Stumpf, 1981). Hydroxylase activity did not
require a-tocopherol as reported previously (Moreau & Stumpf,
198 1). In the present investigation significant ['4C]ricinoleate was
recovered in PtdCho, but most of the radioactive ricinoleate
accumulated as free fatty acid. The addition of unlabelled
ricinoleoyl-CoA to incubation mixtures of microsomes con-
taining [14C]oleoyl-CoA and NADH did not increase the low
[14C]ricinoleate concentration found in the acyl-CoA fraction
nor decrease the [14C]ricinoleate concentration in PtdCho and
free fatty acid. Therefore [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA is not formed as
a free intermediate by hydroxylase and thus it is not likely that
the enzyme can utilize oleoyl-CoA as substrate.

Ricinoleate biosynthesis in castor beans
The addition of NADH to microsomal membranes incubated
with [14C]oleoyl-CoA was not only necessary for the formation
of [14C]ricinoleate but also decreased the total radioactivity
recovered in PtdCho with a corresponding amount of label
appearing in free ricinoleic acid. These observations strongly
indicate that the [14C]oleate in oleoyl-PtdCho was the precursor
of ricinoleic acid. Further evidence for this conclusion was that
the [14C]ricinoleoyl-PtdCho, formed by the acylation of added
lyso-PtdCho with [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA, was specifically hydro-
lysed to yield free [14C]ricinoleic acid. The presence of a ricin-
oleoyl-specific phospholipase A was not restricted to oil-seeds
that accumulate ricinoleate and was also demonstrated in micro-
somal preparations from developing cotyledons of safflower
and oil-seed rape. The apparent general occurrence of this
phospholipase might therefore indicate its possible role in
membrane repair mechanisms by specifically removing oxidized
acyl groups from membrane lipids in order to preserve bilayer
structure and function (see van Kuijk et al., 1987). In the present
study it was not possible to establish whether the phospholipase
was positionally specific for the ricinoleate at position sn-2 of
PtdCho. It was also evident that the ricinoleate can be made
available from PtdCho by other routes than by the action of
phospholipase A2 and particularly in experiments with safflower
microsomal preparations. Here a substantial part of the labelled
ricinoleate was re-distributed, by unknown reactions, from
PtdCho to the triacylglycerols. It has been shown previously that
safflower microsomal preparation can form triacylglycerol with
acyl groups from PtdCho in the apparent absence of acyl-CoA
and particularly in microsomal membranes with elevated con-
centrations of diacylglycerol (Stobart & Stymne, 1985a).
Endogenous ricinoleate in microsomal PtdCho was almost
entirely associated with position sn-2, where it amounted to 9% of
the fatty acid in this position. This concentration probably
reflects the steady state in vivo of ricinoleate synthesis and
removal. In fact, the ricinoleate in PtdCho almost completely
disappeared after incubating the microsomal membranes in buffer
for 90 min at 25 °C (M. Bafor, M. A. Smith, L. Jonsson, K.
Stobart & S. Stymne, unpublished work). The ricinoleate in
positions sn-2 of sn-PtdCho increased to 20% in microsomal
membranes incubated for 60 min with NADH and [14C]oleoyl-
CoA, whereas the amount in position sn-1 rose from a trace to
only 3 %, indicating that hydroxylation occurred mainly on
position sn-2. The selectivity of the hydroxylase for the oleate in
positions sn-2 of sn-PtdCho was further supported by the
distribution of radioactive acyl groups in PtdCho, where sub-
stantial [14C]ricinoleate resided in position sn-2 with none in
position sn-l. In contrast, the [14C]linoleate formed by de-
saturation of [14C]oleoyl-PtdCho was present at both positions.
Cell-free preparations from other developing oil-seeds such as
safflower (Slack et al., 1979; Stobart & Stymne, 1985b), borage
(Griffiths et al., 1988) and linseed (Stymne et al., 1989) also
desaturate the oleate at both sn-positions of sn-PtdCho.
Although ricinoleoyl-CoA was not the immediate product of
the hydroxylation, it was formed from the free ricinoleic acid
released from the PtdCho by an acyl-CoA synthetase enzyme
present in the castor-bean microsomal preparation. Ricinoleoyl-
CoA was an efficient acyl donor in the acylation of Gro3P to
yield PtdOH and triacylglycerols. In incubations with microsomal
membranes, [14C]Gro3P and ricinoleoyl-CoA, the [14C]glycerol
also entered PtdCho but less efficiently than with oleoyl-CoA as
substrate. The incorporation of glycerol backbone into PtdCho
from the Gro3P pathways is, in oil-seeds, believed to be via the
exchange of phosphocholine groups between a diacylglycerol
pool and the PtdCho, rather than the net synthesis of PtdCho
(Slack et al., 1985; Stobart & Stymne, 1985a). It is therefore
possible that the lower amount of [14C]glycerol found in PtdCho
with the ricinoleoyl-CoA substrate compared with the oleoyl-CoA
could be attributed to a rapid utilization of ricinoleoyl-containing
diacyglycerols in triacylglycerol synthesis, thus limiting the
amount of ricinoleoyl-containing diacylglycerols available for
interconversion with PtdCho. Although the incorporation of
['4C]glycerol from [14C]Gro3P into triacylglycerol with ricin-
oleoyl-CoA as acyl donor was over twice that observed with
oleoyl-CoA, the actual mass of triacylglycerol synthesized could
be similar with both acyl-CoA substrates. In the incubations with
the oleoyl-CoA the specific radioactivity ofthe diacylglycerol pool
was probably diluted to a greater extent with non-radioactive
glycerol backbone derived from interconversion with PtdCho.
When an equimolar mixture of [14C]oleoyl-CoA and [14C]-
ricinoleoyl-CoA was supplied to the microsomal preparation in
the presence of unlabelled Gro3P, 75 % of the [14C]triacylglycerol
species synthesized had two [14C]ricinoleoyl moieties and one
[I4C]oleoyl moeity. Thus, the majority of the [14C]diacylglycerols
used for triacylglycerol assembly must have been ricinoleoyl-
containing despite the fact that only a minor part of the
["4C]diacylglycerols that accumulated contained ['4C]ricinoleate.

Scheme 1. Proposed pathway for the synthesis of ricinoleic acid and its
incorporation into triacylglycerols in developing castor-bean
(Ricinus communis) endosperm
Step I. Oleic acid, synthesized in the plastid, is exported to the
cytosol and activated to oleoyl-CoA. Step II. An acyl-CoA:
lysoPtdCho acyltransferase transfers the oleate from oleoyl-CoA to
lysoPtdCho to form oleoyl-PtdCho. Step III. The A"2-fatty acid
hydroxylase catalyses the conversion of oleoyl-PtdCho into ricino-
leoyl-PtdCho at mainly position sn-2. Step IV. A ricinoleoyl-specific
phospholipase A hydrolyses the PtdCho into free ricinoleic acid and
lysoPtdCho. The lysoPtdCho can be re-acylated with oleate from
oleoyl-CoA. Step V. Ricinoleic acid is activated to its CoA ester by
an acyl-CoA synthetase. Step VI. Ricinoleate from ricinoleoyl-CoA
is acylated to Gros3P to yield lysoPtdOH and (step VII) PtdOH.
Step VIII. A phosphohydrolase converts the ricinoleoyl-PtdOH into
a diacylglycerol (DAG): Step IX. Ricinoleoyl-containing diacyl-
glycerols can enter, to some extent, PtdCho by a diacylglycerol-
PtdCho interconversion. Step X. The diacylglycerol acyltransferase
enzyme selectively utilizes ricinoleoyl-containing diacylglycerols in
the formation of triacylglycerol (TAG), thereby limiting the pool
size of ricinoleoyl-containing diacylglycerol available for inter-
conversion with PtdCho.

This may therefore indicate a selective utilization of ricinoleoyl-
containing diacylglycerols by the diacylglycerol acyltransferase
enzyme. A similar preference for diacylglycerols that contain
triacylglycerol dedicated acyl groups was demonstrated also in
the utilization of medium-chain diacylglycerols by the diacyl-
glycerol acyltransferase in microsomal preparations from the
developing seeds of Cuphea lanceolata (Bafor et al., 1990).
Triricinoleate is the main molecular species in castor-bean oil
and yet this species accumulated at a very low rate in vitro. This
may be because the ratio of oleoyl-CoA to ricinoleoyl-CoA
(1:1) was much higher than occurs in vivo.
Oleoyl-CoA and ricinoleoyl-CoA were efficient acyl donors in
the acylation of exogenously supplied lysoPtdCho, catalysed by
the microsomal castor bean acyl-CoA:lysoPtdCho acyltrans-
ferase. In the acyl-exchange reaction, however, between acyl-
CoA and position sn-2 of sn-PtdCho, i.e. incorporation of acyl
groups from acyl-CoA into PtdCho in the absence of added lyso
acceptor (Stymne & Stobart, 1984), the incorporation of ricin-
oleate from ricinoleoyl-CoA into PtdCho was negligible in the
presence of competing oleoyl-CoA substrate. Therefore the
[14C]ricinoleate that entered PtdCho (10-15 % of the total label
in this lipid) in incubations with equimolar mixtures of [14C]-
oleoyl-CoA and [14C]ricinoleoyl-CoA in the presence of Gro3P
was most probably derived from the interconversion of [14C]-
ricinoleoyl-containing diacylglycerols and PtdCho. This would
indicate that ricinoleoyl-containing diacylglycerol species were
not totally selected against in the synthesis of PtdCho.
The biosynthesis of ricinoleic acid and its mode of incorpor-
ation into storage triacylglycerols in the developing castor-
bean endosperm is summarized in Scheme 1.
