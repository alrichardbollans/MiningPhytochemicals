Abstract
Background: Laser microdissection is a useful tool for collecting tissue-specific samples or even
single cells from animal and plant tissue sections. This technique has been successfully employed to
study cell type-specific expression at the RNA, and more recently also at the protein level.
However, metabolites were not amenable to analysis after laser microdissection, due to the
procedures routinely applied for sample preparation. Using standard tissue fixation and embedding
protocols to prepare histological sections, metabolites are either efficiently extracted by
dehydrating solvents, or washed out by embedding agents.
Results: In this study, we used cryosectioning as an alternative method that preserves sufficient
cellular structure while minimizing metabolite loss by excluding any solute exchange steps. Using
this pre-treatment procedure, Arabidopsis thaliana stem sections were prepared for laser
microdissection of vascular bundles. Collected samples were subsequently analyzed by gas
chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) to obtain metabolite profiles.
From 100 collected vascular bundles (~5,000 cells), 68 metabolites could be identified. More than
half of the identified metabolites could be shown to be enriched or depleted in vascular bundles as
compared to the surrounding tissues.
Conclusion: This study uses the example of vascular bundles to demonstrate for the first time
that it is possible to analyze a comprehensive set of metabolites from laser microdissected samples
at a tissue-specific level, given that a suitable sample preparation procedure is used.
Background
Unlike unicellular organisms, plants and animals have
evolved as complex organisms that are defined by distrib-
uting special vital functions to spatially separated organs
and tissues. The distinct functions of tissues and organs
result from the integrated activity of individual cells. Cur-
rent approaches mostly ignore this fact by analyzing sam-
ples that consist of a variety of different cell types and thus
average and dilute the information obtained. Parameters
that define the function and the physiological state of cells
include gene and protein expression, but also the comple-
ment of low-molecular-weight compounds such as lipids,

carbohydrates, vitamins or hormones that carry out much
of the cell's business. Therefore, in addition to transcrip-
tomic and proteomic studies, a comprehensive metabolite
analysis with high spatial resolution is essential to fully
characterize the state of a certain tissue.
To achieve this, analysis of small solutes in individual
plant cells has so far been performed after extracting pico-
liter-sized samples with glass microcapillaries [1] and spe-
cialized techniques have been developed to access the
ingredients of such small-scale samples [2-5]. However,
these techniques remained labor-intensive and require
specialized skills and training.
The recent development of methods that allow the collec-
tion of enough individual cells to process with standard
analytical methods is a key step to integrate high spatial
resolution analysis into routine laboratory work. Laser
microdissection (LM) [6,7] is meanwhile well-established
with animal and human samples and allows the investiga-
tion of RNAs and proteins from specific cell types [8,9].
Recently, also plants have been successfully used in such
experiments and information about gene [10-12] as well
as protein expression [13] was obtained.
Before any tissue can be microdissected, histological sec-
tions have to be prepared. To this end the tissue is nor-
mally fixed and subsequently either embedded in paraffin
[14,15] or cryosectioned [15-17]. However, the fixation
and dehydration steps included in these procedures lead
to an inevitable loss of small cellular components. There-
fore, the resulting tissue sections do not allow measure-
ments of the cellular distribution of metabolites and other
low-molecular-weight compounds.
The intention of the current study was to develop a tissue
processing procedure that enables tissue-specific measure-
ments of metabolites in laser microdissected vascular
bundle samples from A. thaliana stems with well-estab-
lished metabolic profiling techniques. A combination of
metabolite profiles with the already established gene and
protein expression analysis from microdissected tissue
samples will allow a comprehensive description of organ-
isms under different developmental, biotic or abiotic con-
ditions at a tissue-specific level, a further important step
towards integrative biology.
Results and discussion
Preparation and collection of cell type-specific samples
The most important stage in the analysis of specific tissues
or even single cells is the isolation of the target tissue away
from adjacent cells. Using microcapillaries is an estab-
lished option to collect the contents from living plant cells
[1,3,18]. This sampling technique results not only in very
small sample sizes in the picoliter range, but is also lim-
ited mainly to surface exposed cells. In this study, we have
used laser microdissection (LM) as a powerful alternative
sampling method, which allows a contamination-free col-
lection of large homogeneous cell populations also from
cells located deep inside the tissue [19].
To date, LM has been widely used, mainly to study cell
type-specific gene expression and less frequently for tis-
sue-specific protein analysis in animal tissues [8,9].
Recently, this technique was introduced into plant sci-
ences to allow cell type- specific gene expression [10-12]
and protein [13] profiling. Laser microdissection coupled
to laser pressure catapulting (LMPC) is a method that is
applicable to plant material and allows the contact-free
collection of specific cells [20]. To perform successful
LMPC, dry histological sections with reasonable morphol-
ogy and cell integrity are needed. While preserving good
morphology is required to distinguish the different cell
types, it is also crucial to retain the analytes at their in vivo
localization. The latter point particularly needs to be con-
sidered for the analysis of small substances like metabo-
lites, since it is self-evident that they can easily relocate or
get lost during tissue preparation.
In principle, there are two methods for tissue treatment
available that are appropriate for subsequent protein or
RNA analysis. The first is paraffin-embedding [21-23],
which involves numerous steps to fix and dehydrate the
tissue, leading to a complete loss of low-molecular-weight
compounds. The second option is cryosectioning, which
is commonly used to prepare sections for molecular stud-
ies of animal tissue, but often downgrades the histological
architecture. Plant tissue is particularly prone to cell mor-
phology damage, because ice crystal formation is facili-
tated in water-rich tissue. To overcome this problem,
plant material is usually infiltrated with cryoprotection
agents prior to freezing [11,12]. But as with paraffin fixa-
tion, the use of any solvent in the tissue preparation pro-
cedure results in a loss of small substances and makes cell
type-specific metabolite profiling unfeasible.
For tissue-specific metabolite profiling of vascular bun-
dles and sections without vascular bundles, we therefore
followed the strategy illustrated in Figure 1. We employed
a procedure where plant material is frozen without the
addition of any protective compounds, and dried without
chemical dehydration to avoid the loss or relocalization
of small cellular components.
The morphology of the sections obtained from frozen A.
thaliana stems using a cryostat was reasonable and com-
pletely sufficient to selectively excise vascular bundles by
LMPC. However, getting decent morphology of stable tis-
sue parts like vascular bundles is less complicated com-
pared to other cell types, and it might also be morePlant Methods 2005, 1:2 http://www.plantmethods.com/content/1/1/2

difficult to attain cryosections from more delicate plant
organs like leaves or roots. Therefore cryopreservation and
sectioning needs to be optimized depending on the plant
species, organ and tissue type of interest.
LMPC was performed to obtain tissue-specific samples as
outlined in Figure 1. The stepwise process of sample col-
lection from cryosectioned stem material is illustrated in
Figure 2. First, vascular bundles were marked and thereby
selected for excision by utilizing the P.A.L.M. specialized
imaging software (Figure 2a). The cutting was then per-
formed by a focused laser beam (Figure 2b), while the
final tissue collection into the cap of a microfuge tube was
achieved by a defocused laser pulse (Figure 2c and 2d).
The lower limit of the tissue size that can be collected
depends on the magnification and the minimal width of
the laser beam which is in the range of 1 µm. In principle,
LMPC can be used to isolate a few [19] and even single
cells that are resolved e.g. in 40 × magnification (data not
shown). The cap was filled with ethanol to inactivate met-
abolic enzymes during sample collection. This ethanol
had to be refilled every 10 min due to evaporation of the
solvent, since the collection of a sample consisting of 100
vascular bundles required approximately one hour. After
collecting all vascular bundles from a section, the remnant
sections without vascular bundles were scraped off into
ethanol using a scalpel.
While there are studies demonstrating metabolite meas-
urements in single individual or only a few plant cells, the
resulting small sample volumes limited the subsequent
metabolite analyses to a restricted number of metabolites
that could be determined by enzymatic assays [1,24] or
capillary electrophoresis [4,5]. These approaches allow
the determination of sugars or amino acids with extreme
sensitivity but require expertise that is only accessible in a
few specialized labs. By employing GC-TOF MS, we
intended to take advantage of a well-established analytical
standard method that, although less sensitive than the
methods described above and not suitable to measure
metabolites in individual cells, has the advantage of
allowing to comprehensively profile a variety of com-
pounds from different classes simultaneously [25,26].
Moreover, GC MS-based platforms for comprehensive
metabolite analysis are standard techniques accessible in
many labs.

Metabolite profiling
Dealing with such comparably small sample sizes as
obtained by LMPC increases the danger of unwanted con-
taminations. Initial experiments using untreated plastic

derivatization led to GC-MS spectra from blanks that not

only contained the expected artificial peaks resulting from
derivatization and column bleeding, but also unexpected
metabolite peaks as additional contaminants. The use of
reaction tubes from different suppliers resulted in dozens
of contaminant peaks in all method blank chromato-
grams. As a consequence, reaction tubes for all further
experiments (0.5 ml plastic reaction tubes for LMPC as
well as 0.2 ml glass vials for GC-MS derivatization) were
washed twice with distilled water and dried. Pipette tips
were rinsed once with ethanol directly before use. After
sample collection, vortexing and centrifugation, superna-
tants were transferred to glass vials where the derivatiza-
tion was carried out. These precautions drastically
improved the quality of blanks and were essential for
metabolite profiling of small sample amounts.
Next, the influence of the sample preparation procedure
on the metabolite composition was investigated. To this
end we compared samples that were (a) dissolved in eth-
anol directly after cryosectioning or (b) cut, transferred to
slides, stored at 4°C, and used for LMPC. As expected,
some differences in the metabolite profiles of the two
sample types were observable: 11 of 72 metabolites iden-
tified in measurements from 5 complete stem cross sec-
tions (10 replicates) appeared to be sensitive to the
sample preparation procedure. These changes were statis-
tically significant (P < 0.05) and showed an at least 1.5
fold increase or decrease in LMPC samples as compared to
cryosectioned control samples (Table 1). These observed
changes are probably caused by biological and chemical
processes during storage, processing and microdissection,
since all these steps were carried out at room temperature
without air exclusion. Therefore, samples have to run
through identical procedures to allow comparisons of
metabolite levels. Absolute quantities of certain metabo-
lites have to be treated with caution. Dehydroascorbate
(the oxidized form of vitamin C), for example, was found
to be strongly diminished by the tissue preparation proc-
ess (Table 1), putatively due to oxidation by air. In LMPC
collected vascular bundles and sections without vascular
bundles, dehydroascorbate was completely absent.
For tissue-specific GC-TOF MS measurements, we pre-
pared stem cross sections of five A. thaliana plants and col-
lected by LMPC five replicates of about 100 vascular
bundles (~ 5,000 cells) from each plant into ethanol.
Additionally, 10 of the remaining vascular bundle-
depleted sections from each plant were scraped off the
slides and also collected into ethanol. The supernatants
were dried, derivatized with MSTFA and subjected to GC-
TOF MS metabolite profiling. Due to the limited sample
amounts available, derivatization of the metabolites was
done in a volume of only 10 µl. For the same reason, the
injection was carried out without sample wash steps.
Data evaluation
Using the GC-TOF MS approach, 68 metabolites could be
reliably identified in vascular bundles and 65 in sections
without vascular bundles. This number of identified
metabolites is reasonable considering the small number
of cells (~5,000) used for the measurements. The
obtained data sets were investigated in more detail to find
out differences and similarities in the metabolic profiles
from vascular bundles and the surrounding tissue. First,
we carried out a principal component analysis (PCA) to
see if logical grouping in the data set could be related to
maximum variance. This unsupervised multivariate data
analysis generates new variables, principal components
(PC), that attempt to express the overall variance in the
original data. When plotting the tissue-specific metabolite

the influence of tissue processing and laser microdissection on metabolite profiles, complete fresh cryosections and sections after

data, it was immediately obvious that vascular bundles
and sections without vascular bundles were well separated
and had their own distinct metabolite profiles (Figure 3),
indicating that the localization of metabolites was
retained during sample processing.
Student t-test comparisons between the data sets revealed
that about half of the identified metabolites were signifi-
cantly different and either enriched or depleted in vascular
bundles compared to sections without vascular bundles
(Table 2), including six metabolites which were shown to
be sensitive to the sample preparation procedure (Table
1). Figure 4 shows examples of chromatograms of vascu-
lar bundles and sections without vascular bundles for the
mass to charge ratio (m/z) 217. This ion trace is used to
look at sugars and sugar alcohols. The insets (Figures 4a
and 4b) illustrate examples of metabolites being enriched
and depleted, respectively, in vascular bundles. Seventeen
metabolites were significantly depleted in vascular bun-
dles, while 16 metabolites were enriched in vascular bun-
dles and three metabolites, oxoglutarate, glyceraldehyde
and glycerone, were even exclusively found in this tissue
type. We are not aware of anything in the literature that
would account for these metabolites being exclusively
localized to vascular bundles.
Sugars accounted for one class among the metabolites
with tissue dependent differences. While reducing sugars
like glucose, fucose and fructose were depleted in vascular
tissue, the non-reducing sugars sucrose and raffinose were
enriched. This distribution of sugars is characteristic for

phloem sap that probably accounts for a great portion of
vascular bundle metabolites.
A further class of compounds that showed different levels
in vascular bundles compared to the surrounding tissue
was amino acids. From this group glutamate, aspartate
and glutamine are the major amino acids distributed
through the phloem tubes in A. thaliana [27] and there-
fore could be expected to be enriched in vascular bundles.
In this study, we found only aspartate significantly
enriched in vascular bundles compared to the surround-
ing tissue while glutamate and glutamine were indeed
abundant in vascular bundles, but similar levels were also
detected in sections without vascular bundles. These find-
ings are unlikely to be caused by the sample treatment
because none of these amino acids belonged to the group
of substances influenced by the sample processing proce-
dure (Table 1).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates for the first time that laser micro-
dissection can be successfully applied to analyze the spa-
tial distribution of metabolites within plant tissues. The
application of a suitable sample preparation protocol,
omitting any solute exchange steps, followed by LMPC
makes metabolite profiling of 100 vascular bundles,
equivalent to only 5,000 cells, by standard GC-TOF MS
measurements feasible. In principle this method should

functions.
Methods
Preparation of tissue sections and laser microdissection
Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were grown on soil in a
growth chamber under short day conditions (8 h light,
20°C and 16 h dark, 16°C, 75% RH) for four weeks and
then in the greenhouse under long day conditions (16 h
light, 20°C, 60% RH and 8 h dark, 18°C, 75 % RH).
Stems of 6 week-old plants were frozen in liquid nitrogen
and transferred to a cryostat (Microm, Waldorf, Germany)
cooled to -30°C. Using a scalpel, 15 mm-long stem pieces
were cut. Stem pieces were glued onto the sample plate by
employing Neg-50 (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo,
MI, USA), a water-soluble frozen section medium. Using
the cryostat, 30 µm sections were cut and transferred to
glass slides where they dried within seconds at room
temperature.
For microdissection, the P.A.L.M. Laser Microbeam Sys-
tem (Bernried, Germany) was employed. This system con-
sists of a low heat UV (337 nm nitrogen) laser and an
inverted microscope. Cells were selected using the graph-
ics tools of the P.A.L.M. RoboSoftware. After selection,
vascular bundles were isolated by the laser microbeam
and afterwards collected by laser pressure catapulting into
the lid of a 0.5 ml reaction tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany) filled with 50 µl ethanol (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany), placed in a holder closely above the slide. After
collection of vascular bundles, the remaining sections
were scraped off the slides using a scalpel into ethanol
(subsequently called sections without vascular bundles).
The cell numbers were estimated from the number of

peak (retention time 815.369 s) being enriched in vascular bundles.

vascular bundles collected and the cell number counted in
one representative vascular bundle.
Both types of samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 5
min at 14.000 rpm. Supernatants were collected in 0.2 ml
glass vials (Chromacol, Herts, United Kingdom) and
vacuum dried. All used reaction tubes, including their
lids, were washed twice with distilled water and dried
before use. More details of quality control procedures dur-
ing sample preparation are provided in the text main
body. Five parallel plants were employed. From each
plant, five replicates of 100 vascular bundles and 5 sec-
tions without vascular bundles were used for metabolite
analysis. As negative controls, ethanol without microdis-
sected material was processed in parallel to the samples.
Metabolite profiling
For GC-TOF MS (Leco Pegasus II GC-TOF mass spectrom-
eter; Leco, St. Joseph, MI, USA) analysis, the vacuum dried
samples were dissolved in 1 µl methoxamine hydrochlo-
ride (20 mg/ml pyridine) and incubated at 30°C for 90
min with continuous shaking. Then 9 µl of N-methyl-N-
trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamid (MSTFA) were added to
derivatize polar functional groups at 37°C for 30 min. The
derivatized samples were stored at room temperature for
120 min before injection. GC-TOF MS analysis was per-
formed on an HP 5890 gas chromatograph with tapered,
deactivated split/splitless liners containing glass wool
(Agilent, Böblingen, Germany) and 1.5 µl splitless injec-
tion at 230°C injector temperature. Before each injection,
the liner was rinsed with a pure MSTFA injection (1 µl).
Sample injection was carried out without sample wash
steps due to the limited amount of total sample volume.
The GC was operated at constant flow of 2 ml/min helium
and a 30 m 0.32 mm id 0.25 µm MDN35 column (Mach-
erey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The temperature gradient
started at 80°C, was held isocratic for 2 min, and subse-
quently ramped at 15°C /min to a final temperature of
330°C which was held for 6 min. Twenty spectra per sec-
ond were recorded between m/z 85–500. Peak identifica-
tion and quantification were performed using the Pegasus
software package ChromaTOF 1.61 (Leco). A reference
chromatogram was defined that had a maximum of
detected peaks over a signal/noise threshold of 5 and used
for automated peak identification based on mass spectral
comparison to a standard NIST 98 library and own cus-
tomized mass spectral libraries. Automated assignments
of unique fragment ions for each individual metabolite
were taken as default as quantifiers, and manually cor-
rected where necessary. All known artifact peaks caused by
column bleeding or phtalates and polysiloxanes derived
from MSTFA hydrolysis were manually identified and
removed from the results table. Remaining metabolite
data were normalized to the total area of all detected
metabolites and log-transformed. Due to the utmost
requirements of low sample volumes and chemical back-
ground, no further internal standards were added. Statisti-
cal analyses were performed using Matlab version 6.5
(The MathWorks, MA, USA).
