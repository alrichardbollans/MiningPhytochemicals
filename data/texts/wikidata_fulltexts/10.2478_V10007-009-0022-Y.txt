Illicium is a genus of flowering plants comprising 42 species of evergreen shrubs
and small trees, and is the sole genus in the family Illiciaceae. The species are native to
the tropical and subtropical regions of eastern and southeastern Asia, southeastern North
America and the West Indies. Illicium anisatum (also known as I. religiosum, I. japonicum,
shikimmi and skimmi) is distributed throughout eastern Asia where it is used as an orna-

The essential oil of air-dried Illicium anisatum (Illiciaceae),
obtained by hydrodistillation was analyzed by gas chro-
matography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Fifty-two com-
ponents were identified in the essential oil and the main
component was eucalyptol (21.8 %). The antioxidant and
anti-elastase activities of the essential oil were also inve-
stigated; the essential oil exhibited moderate DPPH sca-
venging and anti-elastase activities. To clarify the mech-
anism of the anti-inflammatory activities of I. anisatum es-
sential oil (IAE), we evaluated whether it could modu-
late the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglan-
din E2 (PGE2) by activated macrophages. The results indi-
cate that IAE is an effective inhibitor of LPS-induced NO
and PGE2 production in RAW 264.7 cells. These inhibi-
tory activities were accompanied by dose-dependent de-
creases in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins and
iNOS and COX-2 mRNA. In order to determine whether
IAE can be safely applied to human skin, the cytotoxic
effects of IAE were determined by colorimetric MTT as-
says in human dermal fibroblast and keratinocyte HaCaT
cells. IAE exhibited low cytotoxicity at 100 mg mL–1. Ba-
sed on these results, we suggest that IAE may be consid-
ered an anti-aging and anti-inflammatory candidate for
cosmetic materials, but additional in vitro and in vivo tests
have to be performed to prove its safety and efficacy.

mental plant. It is also found in Jeju Island, Wan-do, and the southern parts of Korea. I.
anisatum has a long history of use in folk medicine and is used as herbal tea to treat coli-
cky pain in infants. However, it is scientifically recognized as highly poisonous and is
therefore not fit for human consumption (1). Actually I. anisatum is a neurotoxic plant
because it contains sesquiterpenic lactones. Recent studies have shown that various parts
of I. anisatum possess the inhibitory activities of aldose reductase, lipase and glycation as
well as antioxidant activity (2–4). The phenolic compounds of leaf oil include 1-allyl-2-me-
thoxy-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene, 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol, 1-allyl-3-methoxy-4-(3-
-methylbut-2-enyloxy) benzene and 1-allyl-3,5-dimethoxy-4-(3-methylbut-2-enyloxy) ben-
zene (5). Anisatin, a potent GABA antagonist can also be extracted from I. anisatum (6).
However, the biological activity of L. anisatum essential oil (IAE) has not been described.
Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to identify the main constituents of
IAE and to evaluate their biological activities such as their antioxidant, anti-elastase, and
anti-inflammatory activities and cytotoxicities for application to human skin.
EXPERIMENTAL
Plant material
Voucher specimens were identified by Dr. G. Song and deposited in the herbarium
of the Jeju Biodiversity Research Institute. The plant was identified immediately after
collection (Joongmoon area of Jeju Island in November 2007) and air-dried at room tem-
perature for later analysis.
Isolation of the essential oil
The air-dried leaves (1.4 kg) of I. anisatum were powdered and immersed in 4.0 L of
distilled water in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The percentage yield of the oil from I. ani-
satum was 0.24 % (V/m). The oil was kept at 4 °C in a sealed brown vial. For the injection
(splitless), 10 mL of essential oil was diluted in 500 mL of CH2Cl2, and 1 mL of this diluted
solution was injected.
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
Gas chromatographic analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890N gas
chromatograph equipped with an apolar DB-1HT column (30 m ´ 0.32 mm ´ 0.1 mm)
and a split-splitless injection port (splitless mode). The temperature was set at 40 °C for
5 min, ramped to 210 °C at 10 °C min–1 and kept at 250 °C for 28 min. Compounds were
identified by their retention indices on columns and by GC-MS using a Hewlett-Packard
MSD 5975 mass spectrometer at 70 eV.
Determination of anti-oxidant activity
The antioxidant reaction was carried out in 99.8 % ethanol containing 0.1 mmol L–1
DPPH and essential oil (0.625 mg mL–1 to 10 mg mL–1). The scavenging effect against

DPPH radical was assessed at room temperature for 10 min. The change in the absor-
bance at 517 nm was measured in a 96-well reader.
Elastase inhibition assay
The activity of porcine pancreatic elastase type IV (Sigma Chem. Co., USA) was ex-
amined using N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide as the substrate and by measuring
the release of p-nitroaniline at 410 nm. The reaction was carried out in 200 mmol L–1
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mmol L–1 N-Suc-(Ala)3-nitroanilide and 0.104 unit
mL–1 elastase. Essential oil (0.625 mg mL–1 to 10 mg mL–1) was added to the reaction
mixture, and the elastase inhibition was assessed at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was pre-
-incubated for 10 min before addition of the substrate. The change in absorbance was
measured at 410 nm in a 96-well reader.
Cell culture
The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was purchased from the Korean Cell
Line Bank (KCLB; Korea). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; GIBCO Inc., USA) supplemented with 100 U mL–1 of penicillin, 100 mg
mL–1 of streptomycin and 10 % of fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO Inc.). The cells were
incubated in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C and were subcultured every 3 days.
Determination of nitric oxide (NO) production
After pre-incubation of RAW 264.7 cells (1.5 ´ 105 cells mL–1) with lipopolysacha-
ride (LPS, 1 mg mL–1) for 24 hours, the quantity of nitrite in the culture medium was
measured as an indicator of NO production. Briefly, 100 mL of cell culture medium was
mixed with 100 mL of Griess reagent (1 % sulfanilamide and 0.1 % naphthylethylenedi-
amine dihydrochloride in 2.5 % phosphoric acid), the mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 10 min, and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured in a microplate
reader. Fresh culture medium was used as a blank in every experiment. The quantity of
nitrite was determined from a sodium nitrite standard curve. All experiments were per-
formed in triplicate.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay
RAW 264.7 cells (1.5 ´ 105 cells mL–1) plated in 96-well plates were pre-incubated
for 18 h and then treated with LPS (1 mg mL–1) plus aliquots of the essential oil (25, 50,
and 100 mg mL–1) at 37 °C for 24 h. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from
RAW 264.7 cells was used to detect cytotoxicity and was measured at the end of each
proliferation experiment. LDH leakage is a means of measuring membrane integrity as a
function of the amount of cytoplasmic LDH released from the cytosol into the medium.
LDH activity was determined from the production of NADH during the conversion of
lactate to pyruvate (7, 8) and was measured using an LDH cytotoxicity detection kit
(Promega, USA). Briefly, the culture medium was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min at
room temperature. The cell-free culture medium (50 mL) was then collected and incu-
bated with 50 mL of the reaction mixture from the cytotoxicity detection kit for 30 min at

room temperature in the dark. 1 mol mL–1 HCl (50 mL) was added to each well to stop
the enzymatic reaction. The optical density of the solution at a wavelength of 490 nm
was then measured using an ELISA plate reader. Percent cytotoxicity was determined
relative to the control group. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Determination of PGE2 production
Cells were treated with LPS (1 mg mL–1) for 24 h to allow cytokine production. The
PGE2 concentration in the culture medium was quantified using a competitive enzyme
immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The production of PGE2 was measured relative to that following control treatment. All
experiments were performed in triplicate.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells was prepared with Tri-Reagent (MRC,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNAwas stored at –70 °C until use. One
mg RNA was reverse transcribed with M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA),
oligo dT-18 primer, dNTP (0.5 mmol mL–1) and 1 U RNase inhibitor. The reaction cocktail
was sequentially incubated at 70 °C for 5 min, 25 °C for 5 min, and 37 °C for 60 min, and
M-MuLV reverse transcriptase was then inactivated by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. Poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in reaction buffer [cDNA, 1.25 U Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega), 3’- and 5’-primer (50 mmol mL–1 each) and 200 mmol mL–1 dNTP in
200 mmol mL–1 Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.4) containing 500 mmol mL–1 KCl and 1–4 mmol
mL–1 MgCl2]. PCR was performed in a DNA gene cycler (BIO-RAD, USA) with amplifi-
cation for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s (denaturing), 60–65 °C for 45 s (annealing) and 72 °C
for 1 min (primer extension). The primers used in this study were: b-actin (forward primer
5’-GTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCAG-3’ and reverse primer 5’-GGAGGAAGAGGATGC-
GGCAGT-3’), iNOS (forward primer 5’-CCCTTCCGAAGTTTCTGGCAGCAGC-3’ and
reverse primer 5’-GGCTGTCAGAGCCTCGTGGCTTTGG-3’), COX-2 (forward primer
5’-CACTACATCCTGACCCACTT-3’ and reverse primer 5’-ATGCTCCTGCTTGAGTATGT-
-3’). PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5 % agarose gels and stained with ethidium
bromide. The b-actin, iNOS and COX-2 primers produced the expected amplified prod-
ucts of 603, 496 and 696 bp, respectively.
Immunoblotting
RAW 264.7 cells were pre-incubated for 18 h and then stimulated with LPS (1 mg mL–1)
in the presence of test materials for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were collected and
washed twice with cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer
[50 mmol mL–1 Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol mL–1 NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmol mL–1
EDTA, 1 mmol mL–1 EGTA, 10 mmol mL–1 NaF, 1 mmol mL–1 dithiothreitol, 1 mmol mL–1
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mg mL–1 aprotinin, 25 mg mL–1 leupeptin] and kept on
ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12000´g at 4 °C for 15 min and the
supernatants were stored at –70 °C until use. Protein concentration was measured by the
Bradford method (9). Aliquots of the lysates (30–50 mg of protein) were separated on
8–12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)

membranes (BIO-RAD) with glycine transfer buffer [192 mmol mL–1 glycine, 25 mmol
mL–1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20 % MeOH (V/V)]. After blocking nonspecific sites with 5 %
nonfat dried milk, the membranes were incubated with specific primary mouse mono-
clonal anti-iNOS Ab (1:1000, Calbiochem, USA) or rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 Ab (1:1000,
BD Biosciences Pharmingen, USA) at 4 °C overnight. Each membrane was further incu-
bated for 30 min with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG (1:5000, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, UK) to mouse or rabbit, respectively. Immunoactive proteins were
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection kit
(Amersham Biosciences, USA).
Cytotoxicity assay of I. anisatum essential oil
Human normal fibroblast and HaCaT cells were cultured in DMEM medium con-
taining 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified
95 % air/5 % CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded on 96-well plates and drug treatment
began 24 h after seeding. The general viability of cultured cells was determined by the
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, in
which MTT was reduced to formazan in viable cells. After human normal fibroblast and
HaCaT cells were incubated with various concentrations of IAE for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5 %
CO2 atmosphere, MTT (1 mg mL–1 in PBS) was added to each well in a 1/10 volume of
medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added
to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was then measured at 570 nm with a
spectrophotometer (PowerWave X340, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., USA).
Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to determine the statistical signifi-
cance of differences between the values for the various experimental and control groups.
Data are expressed as mean ´ standard errors (SEM) and the results were taken from at
least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chemical composition of the essential oil
The general chemical profile of the essential oil, the percentage content, and the re-
tention indices of the constituents are summarized in Table I. A total of 52 volatile con-
stituents were tentatively identified on the basis of their mass spectra, which were com-
pared to those in the literature. The retention indices were calculated using a homologous
series of n-alkanes C6–C25. The peak areas of individual compounds were related to total
peak areas of compounds detected by GC. Only the components with matches exceed-
ing 80 %, which represented about 85.6 % of the essential oil from I. anisatum, were char-
acterized. Eucalyptol (21.8 %), sabinene (5.3 %), a-terpinenyl acetate (4.9 %), kaurene
(4.5 %), isopimaradiene (3.2 %), safrol (2.7 %), b-linalool (2.6 %), d-cadinene (2.2 %),
a-cadinol (2.2), and terpene-4-ol (1.9 %) were the main constituents of the essential oil of

I. anisatum. In contrast, the main compounds identified by Cook and Howard (10) were
cineole (18.1 %), linalool (10.1 %), methyleugenol (9.8 %), a-terpinenyl acetate (6.8 %), and
safrol (6.6 %). This difference in the main components may be due to the provenance of
the plant, harvest time or development stage, extraction technique, or the use of fresh or
dried plant material. All of these factors influence the chemical composition and biologi-
cal activity.
Anti-elastase and antioxidant activities of the essential oil
IAE was investigated for elastase inhibition. In this assay, IAE produced more than
70 % inhibition at 2.5 mg mL–1. In order to determine the IC50 value for IAE, we con-
ducted experiments to assess the dose-response relationships. The IC50 value for IAE was
1.79 mg mL–1. IAE was also investigated in a DPPH assay. In this assay, IAE had good
antioxidant activity (IC50, 3.83 mg mL–1). These activities can be attributed to the pres-
ence of eucalyptol, sabinene, a-terpinenyl acetate, kaurene, isopimaradiene, safrol and
b-linalool. Considering the different groups of chemical compounds present in IAE, it is
most likely that the biological activity is attributable to a synergism between components.
Eucalyptol and kaurene have been reported to have significant anti-oxidant activity (11–13).
Effects of IAE on LPS-induced NO and PGE2 production and cell viability
To investigate the effect of IAE on NO production, we measured the accumulation
of nitrite, a stable oxidized product of NO, in culture media. NO production was exam-
ined in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS for 24 h in the presence or absence of IAE.

The GC/MS retention indices were calculated using a homologous series of n-alkanes C6-C25. Components
were tentatively identified based on library and literature searches and only those components showing
matches exceeding 80 % were selected.
Nitrite levels in LPS-stimulated cells increased significantly compared to control cells.
As shown in Fig. 1a, IAE (25, 50 and 100 mg mL–1) inhibited markedly and dose-depend-
ently the LPS-induced NO production by RAW 264.7 cells. There was no basal NO pro-
duction in cells incubated only with IAE without LPS (data not shown). The numbers of
viable activated macrophages were not altered by IAE as determined by LDH assays, indi-
cating that the inhibition of NO synthesis by IAE was not simply due to cytotoxic effects.
We further examined the effects of IAE on PGE2 production in LPS-stimulated RAW
264.7 macrophages. When macrophages were stimulated with LPS (1 mg mL–1) for 24 h,
the levels of PGE2 increased in the culture medium. As shown in Fig. 1b, IAE (25, 50,
and 100 mg mL–1) suppressed the LPS-induced PGE2 production in a dose-dependent
manner.
Effects of IAE on LPS-induced iNOS and COX-2 protein and mRNA expressions
Western blot and RT-PCR analyses were performed to determine whether the inhibi-
tory effects of IAE on pro-inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE2) were related to the
modulation of iNOS and COX-2 expression. In unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, iNOS and
COX-2 protein and mRNA were not detected, but LPS remarkably upregulated their pro-

tein levels and pre-treatment with IAE inhibited these upregulations. On the other hand,
IAE did not affect the expression of b-actin, a housekeeping gene. As shown in Fig. 2a,
IAE reduced the expression of iNOS protein in a dose-dependent manner. Since the
amounts of iNOS protein correlated with NO accumulation, these results suggest that
IAE inhibited NO production by reducing the iNOS protein expression. We also found
that the amount of the 72-kDa COX-2 protein was increased by LPS and this increase
was dose-dependently antagonized by the IAE (at 20, 50, and 100 mg mL–1).
To further determine whether the inhibition of LPS-stimulated NO and PGE2 pro-
duction by IAE was mediated by the regulation of iNOS and COX-2 expression, RT-PCR
analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 2b, the expressions of iNOS and COX-2
mRNA were significantly elevated in macrophages treated with LPS (1 mg mL–1) com-
pared to unstimulated cells (control). RT-PCR analyses revealed that IAE reduced iNOS
and COX-2 mRNA without affecting the mRNA of b-actin, a housekeeping protein. The
IAE also reduced the expression of iNOS and COX-2 protein in a dose-dependent man-
ner. In general, these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of IAE on LPS-induced
NO and PGE2 production are caused by iNOS and COX-2 suppression. Furthermore, the
RT-PCR analyses indicate that mRNA levels of iNOS and COX-2 correlate with their
protein levels. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of IAE on iNOS and COX-2 gene expres-
sion appears to be one of the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory action of IAE. In con-
clusion, IAE actively suppresses the expression of genes implicated in inflammation.
Cytotoxicity assay of IAE
We examined the cytotoxic effects of IAE on human dermal fibroblasts and kera-
tinocyte HaCaT cells. The essential oil exhibited low cytotoxicity in both fibroblast and

HaCaT cells at concentrations below 100 mg mL–1 (Fig. 3). Based on these results, we have
concluded that IAE may be introduced as a possible therapeutic agent for skin health.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we demonstrated that IAE has good antioxidant, anti-elastase and
anti-inflammatory effects and low cytotoxicity in human cell lines. Therefore, according
to these results, we suggest that IAE may be employed as an effective therapeutic agent
to promote skin health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report providing a
scientific basis for the cosmetic use of IAE.

sobnost hvatanja DPPH radikala i inhibicije elastaze. Kako bi se objasnio mehanizam
protuupalnog djelovanja eteri~nog ulja I. anisatum (IAE), ispitan je u~inak na modulira-
nje produkcije du{ikovog(II) oksida (NO) i prostaglandina E2 (PGE2) iz aktiviranih ma-
krofaga. Rezultati ukazuju da je IAE u~inkovit inhibitor LPS-inducirane produkcije NO i
PGE2 u RAW 264.7 stanicama. Inhibitorno djelovanje popra}eno je smanjenjem ekspre-
sije iNOS i COX-2 proteina i iNOS i COX-2 mRNA. Kako bi se odredilo mo`e li se IAE
sigurno primijeniti na ljudsku ko`u, citotoksi~ni u~inci IAE odre|eni su kolorimetrijskim
MTT testom u humanim dermalnim fibroblastima i keratinocitima HaCaT. IAE je poka-
zao nisku citotoksi~nost pri koncentraciji 100 mg mL–1. Temeljem ovih rezultata IAE se
mo`e smatrati potencijalnim sredstvom protiv starenja i protuupalnim sredstvom u koz-
meti~kim pripravcima. Me|utim, dodatni in vitro i in vivo testovi nu`ni su za potvrdu
njegove sigurnosti i u~inkovitosti.
