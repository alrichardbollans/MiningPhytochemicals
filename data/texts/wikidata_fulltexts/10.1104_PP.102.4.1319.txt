Plant Physiol. (1993) 102: 1319-1324 An in Vitro System of Indole-3-Acetic Acid Formation from Tryptophan in Maize (Zea mays) Coleoptile Extracts Tomokazu Koshiba* and Haruo Matsuyama Department of Biology (T.K.) and Department of Chemistry (H.M.), Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-03, Japan l h e  formation of a product from tryptophan that had the same retention time as that of authentic indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on high performance liquid chromatography was detected in crude extracts of maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles. l h e  product was identi- fied as IAA by mass spectrometry. The IAA-forming activity was co-purified with an indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld) oxidase activity by chromatography on hydrophobic and gel filtration (CPC-100) columns. During purification, the IAA-forming activity, rather than that of IAAld oxidase, decreased; but when hemoprotein obtained from the same tissue was added, activity recovered to the same level as that of IAAld oxidase. The promotive activity of the hemoprotein was confirmed by the result that the activity coincided with amounts of the hemoprotein after CPC-100 column chroma- tography. l h e  hemoprotein was characterized and identified as a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (1. Koshiba 119931 Plant Cell Physiol [in press]). l h e  reaction of the IAA-forming activity was apparently one step from tryptophan. The activity was inhibited by 2-mercap- toethanol. l h e  optimum temperature for the IAA-forming system as well as for the IAAld oxidase was 50 to 60°C, and the activity at 30'C was one-third to one-half of that at 60°C. l h e  system did not discriminate the i- and o-enantiomers of tryptophan. IAA plays important roles in many physiological processes in plants, such as cell elongation, cell division, phototropism, and gravitropism. Many previous efforts to establish the pathway of IAA biosynthesis in plants have not yielded conclusive evidence. From the similarity of molecular struc- ture between Trp and IAA, Trp was considered to be a precursor of IAA in plants, and two pathways from Trp that go through IPyA or TNHz have been generally accepted (Sembdner et al., 1981). These pathways were proposed mainly based on in vivo tracer experiments in which incor- poration of radioactive Trp into the putative intermediates was investigated after a long period of feeding (6-72 h) (Khalifah, 1967; Sherwin and Purves, 1969; Gibson et al., 1972a, 1972b). However, after a short period of 1 to 3 h, incorporation of the label to the putative intermediates was not observed in maize tissues (Iino, 1982) or barley proto- plasts (Sandberg et al., 1982). Many in vitro experiments at the enzyme level have been done to confirm the presence of the hypothetical pathways. For example, the possible involvement in IAA biosynthesis of Trp decarboxylase (Sherwin, 1970; Elkinawy and Raa, 1974; Fernandez et al., 1989; Songstad et al., 1990), Trp * Corresponding author; fax 81-3-426-77-2559. aminotransferase (Truelsen, 1972; McQueen-Mason and Hamilton, 1989; Koshiba et al., 1993), TNH2 oxidase (Phelps and Sequeira, 1967; Percival and Purves, 1974), and IAAld oxidase (Rajagopal, 1971; Purves and Brown, 1978; Miyata et al., 1981) has been extensively studied in plants. However, many of them showed wide substrate specificities, and no conclusive in vitro enzyme system that produces IAA from Trp has been obtained from any plant source. In addition, the pathways via IAOX (Helmlinger et al., 1987, Ludwig- Miiller and Hilgenberg, 1988) and IAM (Kawaguchi et al., 1991) were recently reported. Thus, the IAA synthetic path- way from Trp in plants should be reinvestigated from differ- ent angles. Recently, Cohen and co-workers suggested that Trp was not a precursor of IAA in Trp synthesis mutants of Lemna (Baldi et al., 1991) and maize (Wright et al., 1991). However, they reported more recently that IAA was synthesized from Trp in bean seedlings (Bialek et al., 1992). Another group demonstrated that a specific Trp pool that exhibited rapid turnover was involved in IAA biosynthesis in tomato shoots (Cooney and Nonhebel, 1991). Iino (1982) showed that IAA was synthesized from Trp in maize coleoptile tips and that the synthetic activity was inhibited by red-light irradiations. We confirmed the results with 2- to 3-mm tip sections of maize coleoptiles and found that an IAA-like product was produced from Trp in crude extracts of maize coleoptiles. The activity was retained after chromatography of the crude extract on hydrophobic and gel-filtration columns and was co-eluted with the IAAld oxidase, which had a relatively large mo1 wt of around 300,000. A similar in vitro system was reported only in extracts of oat (Lantican and Muir, 1967). Here, we report a nove1 IAA-forming system from maize coleoptiles.

Enzyme Extraction and Partia1 Purification Extraction and purification of the enzyme were carried out at O to 4OC and the buffers used contained 1 mM MgC12. The coleoptile tips (1 cm long, 9.17 g) were homogenized in 18 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and centri- fuged at 25,OOOg for 20 min. The supernatant (crude extract) was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. Precipitate ob- tained between 0.3 and 0.8 saturation was dialyzed against the phosphate buffer containing 20% (w/v) ammonium sul- fate for 30 min. The enzyme solution was centrifuged at 25,OOOg for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied to a hydrophobic column, Phenyl-5PW (Tosoh, 8 X 75 mm), which had been equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The column was connected to an HPLC system (Tosoh, multi- pump CCPM) with a UV detector. After the column had been washed with 10 mL of the salt buffer, the adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 20 to 0% (w/v) in the phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 0.667 mL/min. The elution of proteins was monitored at 280 nm, and 2-mL fractions were collected. The amount of hemoprotein was monitored at 405 nm, and IAA- forming and IAAld oxidase activities were assayed as de- scribed below. Fractions of hemoprotein and IAA-forming activity that had co-eluted with IAAld oxidase were sepa- rately pooled (hatched area in Fig. 1) and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centrisart I (Sartorius, CS-10). Each sam- ple was then applied to a gel-filtration column (GPC-100, SynchroPak, 7.8 X 300 mm) equilibrated with 50 mM phos- phate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.15 M KC1. The column was developed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Enzyme Assay The reaction mixture (100 pL) for the IAA-forming activity contained 5 to 50 pL of an enzyme solution, 20 mM L-Trp, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and 1 mM MgC12, pH 7.4, in the absence or presence of hemoprotein (5 pL, A403 = 0.1). The hemoprotein had been partially purified from maize coleop- tiles by ammonium sulfate fractionation (0.5-0.8 saturation), Phenyl-5PW, and GPC-100 column chromatography in a manner simi1,ar to that described above. After incubation at 6OoC for 40 min, 8 pL of 1 N HCl, 5 pL of 2 M NaHS03, and 50 pL of 100% methanol were added successively to the mixture. The mixture was centrifuged and 100 pL of the supernatant was injected onto the HPLC system (Tosoh, CCPM). HPLC was performed with an ODS C-18 column (Tosoh, 0.5 X: 15 cm, 5-pm particle size) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The solvent system was a 10 to 50% mcithanol gradient containing 0.2% acetic acid. The indole compounds were monitored at 280 nm and the amount of IAA was determined from its peak area. One unit of the activity was defined as the activity required to produce 1 nmol 1of IAA under the assay conditions. IAAld oxidase activity was assayed in 100 pL of reaction mixture that contained an enzyme solution, 0.15 II~M free IAAld (prepared from IAAld bisulfite as described by Bower et al. [1978]), 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 1 mM MgC12, pH 7.4. Other procedures were the same as those described for the IAA-forming activity assay. MS A large-scale reaction was carried out to identify th,e prod- uct by MS. The reaction mixture (2 mL) consisted of 300 pL of an enzyme solution obtained after Phenyl-5PW column chromatography, 100 pL of partially purified hemoprotein (Ado3 = l . O ) ,  20 mM L-Trp, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, an'd 1 mM MgC12, pH 7.4. After incubation at 6OoC for 40 min, 160 pL of 1 N HCl was added to the mixture. The acidic and neutra1 materials were partitioned to ether phase (4 mL X 2).  After the ether was removed at 4OoC, the residue was dissolved in 20 pL of methanol. Samples of 5 pL were analyzed with a direct capillary inlet to a JMS-DX300 mass spectrometer at 70 electron volts. RESULTS When a crude extract from maize coleoptiles was incubated with L-Trp, a product that had the same retention time as that of authentic IAA was detected on HPLC. As described below, the product was identified as IAA by MS. The IAA- forming activity was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on Phenyl-5PW and GPC-100 columns (Table I). The activity was co-purifi1.d with Table 1.

The broken line represents the level of IAA-forming activity without addition of the fraction. Hem- oprotein and protein were monitored for A405 (- - -) and A280 ( .  . . . . .), respectively. Arrows indicate positions of the same molec- ular markers as described in the legend for Figure 2. needed for maximum activation of the IAA-forming activity was about 15 nM (the concentration was calculated from the extinction coefficient of a-band at 556 nm, 20 = 1 mM [l-cm light path], and from its mo1 wt of 28,000). Higher concen- tration of the protein caused the production of many un- known products other than IAA. Under these conditions, the IAA-forming activity was almost the same as that of IAAld oxidase on Phenyl-5PW and GPC-100 column chromatog- raphy (Figs. 1 and 2, Table I). The M, of the IAA-foming system as well as IAAld oxidase estimated on gel filtration was about 300,000 (Fig. 2). The reaction products of the IAA-forming system were analyzed by HPLC. A peak having the same retention time as authentic IAA was detected (Fig. 4a). No other product such as IPyA, TNH2, or IAAld was observed. After the reaction of the hemoprotein (15 n M  APX) and Trp, neither IAAld nor IAA was detected (Fig. 4b). A large-scale reaction (2 mL of the mixture) of the IAA-forming system was carried out, and the product was analyzed by MS. The mass spectra of authentic IAA showed major fragment ions of m/z 175 (M+), 130 (base peak), 131, 103, and 77 (Fig. 5a). The same fragments were observed in the peaks of the reaction product, with small amounts of unknown contaminants, such as m/z 167, 149, 71, 56, and 53 (Fig. 5b). Thus, the product was identified as IAA. Some properties of the IAA-forming system were charac- terized (Table 11). The reaction did not proceed under anaer- obic conditions and was inhibited by reductants such as 2- mercaptoethanol. The activity was completely lost when the system was boiled for 5 min. The system did not discriminate between the L- and D-enantiomers of Trp as its substrates.  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 8, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1993 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The IAAld oxidase fraction obtained from GPC-100 column chromatography (hatched area in Fig. 2) was used for the reactions. Elution profiles of the products of the IAA-forming system in the presence of homoprotein (a) and only hemoprotein with Trp (b) were recorded by monitoring the Azso. The positions of Trp, IAAld, and IAA are indicated with arrows. Koshiba and Matsuyama Plant Physiol. Vol. 102, 1993 Optimum concentration of Trp for the activity was more than 10 mM. The optimum temperature for the IAA-forming sys- tem was at 60 to 7OoC, which was similar to that of IAAld oxidase (Fig. 6). At 3OoC, the activity was about one-third of that at 6OOC. The pH optima of the IAA-fonning system and also IAAld oxidase were pH 6.5 to 7.5. Effects of various compounds, !juch as NAD(P), NAD(P)H, ascorbate, H202, MnZ+, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, FAD, FMN, vitamin E:3, and pyrrolo-quinoline quinone, on the activity were tested in the presence or absence of the hemoprotein. Among these, FAD, FMN, and pyrrolo-quinoline quinone showed a significant promotive effect. However, FAD and FMN had a nonenzymic catalytic activity of conversion from Trp to IAAld (our un- published obiservation), and pyrrolo-quinoline quinone was also reported to have such activity (Itoh et al., 1984). DISCUSSION In the present study, we found an IAA-forming activity from Trp in maize coleoptile tips. The activity was co-purified with IAAld oxidase and required a hemoprotein, extracted from the same tissue, for its full activity. The hemoprotein, which was identified as cytosolic APX (Koshiba, 1993), showed no activity for Trp as substrate at least at the optimum concentration (15 nM) for the IAA-forming activity.. These results present two possibilities. The first possibility is that IAAld oxidase itself has a catalytic activity to form IAA from Trp, and APX c'r some other factor(s) promotes the activity.

The enzyme also has various catalytic activities other than oxidation of aldehydes, such as oxidation of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds (Hall and Krenitsky, 1986), reduction of diphenyl sulfoxide (Yoshihara and Tatsumi, 1986), nitroreduction of aromatic heterocyclic compounds (Bauer and Howard, 1991), and ox- ime-metabolizing activity (Tatsumi and Ishigai, 1987). The enzyme sometimes exhibits strong activity against a specific substrate if some cofactor is present (K. Tatsumi, personal communication). The mo1 wt of 260,000 to 350,000 and the heat-stable property of the animal enzyme are similar to those of IAAld oxidase investigated here. Plant aldehyde oxidases have been reported in potato tubers (Rothe, 1974) and oat coleoptiles (Rajagopal, 1971) and IAAld oxidases in cucumber (Purves and Brown, 1978) and pea (Miyata et al., 1981) seedlings, but no detailed characterization with purified enzyme has been reported. The second possible explanation for our results is that APX has a catalytic activity to form IAAld from Trp in the presence of IAAld oxidase, which catalyzes successively the reaction from IAAld to IAA. APXs, a kind of peroxidase, are known to have specificity for ascorbate as an electron donor. Chlo- roplastic APX is known to have a function in the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide in plant cells (Asada and Takahashi, 1987), but the physiological role of cytosolic APX is obscure. The maize APX in the present work was purified and char- acterized as a cytosolic APX (Koshiba, 1993). Multifunctional properties of plant peroxidases are well known, as are some oxidative activities in relation to phytohormone metabolism, such as the oxidation of IAA (Nakano et al., 1982), the production of IAM (Riddle and Mazelis, 1964, 1965) and IAOX (Ludwig-Miiller et al., 1990) from Trp, and the ethylene formation from ACC (Boyer and De Jaegher, 1986; Acosta et al., 1991). APX from Acetabulaia, mung bean, and sugar beet was also reported to have the activity for converting ACC to ethylene (Kevers et al., 1992). The mechanisms of these peroxidase actions are unknown, but it is possible that Trp molecules are oxidized by APX (or peroxidase) to form IAAld under some conditions. To reveal in more detail the mechanism of the IAA-forming reaction and also the possibility of its involvement on IAA Table II.
