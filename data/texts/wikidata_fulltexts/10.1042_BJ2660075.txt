Chymopapain is a polypeptide of 218 amino acid residues. It has considerable structural similarity with
papain and papaya proteinase Q, including conservation of the catalytic site and of the disulphide bonding.
Chymopapain is like papaya proteinase Q in carrying four extra residues between papain positions 168 and
169, but differs from both papaya proteinases in the composition of its S2 subsite, as well as in having a
second thiol group, Cys- 1 17. Some evidence for the amino acid sequence ofchymopapain has been deposited
as Supplementary Publication SUP 50153 (12 pages) at the British Library Document Supply Centre,
Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, U.K., from whom copies may be obtained on the terms

INTRODUCTION
Of the major cysteine proteinase components of Carica
papaya (Jansen & Balls, 1941) the primary structures of
two, papain (Cohen et al., 1986) and papaya proteinase
Q (Dubois et al., 1988), have been reported. In 1985 we
described a preliminary sequence for the third proteinase,
chymopapain (Lynn et al., 1985), and we now describe
the primary structure of that molecule. While this work
was being prepared for publication we learned of a
parallel study of chymopapain (A. G. Schnek, personal
communication). The results obtained in the two lab-
oratories have been compared and are identical, though
different methodologies were employed by the two groups
involved.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enzyme purification
Chymopapain was prepared from crude type I papaya
latex from the Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
U.S.A.) by using methods previously described (Lynn,
1979). Extraction of the latex was in 'activation' buffer
(Sluyterman & Widjenes, 1970), and, after centrifugation
at 20000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, the extract was immediately
applied to the agarose-mercurial affinity column (Sluyter-
man & Widjenes, 1970), when it was bound in an inactive
form. Subsequent purification steps (Lynn, 1979) were
with the inactive mercurial derivative of the enzyme. The
chymopapain was homogeneous on polyacrylamide-gel
electrophoresis.
Reduction and alkylation
A 10 mg (400 nmol) portion of chymopapain was
dissolved in 1.0 ml of 0.1 M-Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.3,
containing 6 M-guanidinium chloride and 2.5 mg of di-
sodium EDTA. After reduction by the addition of
1.24 mg (0.8,umol) of dithiothreitol (Calbiochem, La
Jolla, CA, U.S.A.) under N2 at room temperature for 1 h,
S-carboxy['4C]methylation was effected by the dropwise
addition of 5 ,uCi of iodo[2-'4C]acetic acid (56 mCi/mol;
Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL, U.S.A.)
in 50 ,ul of ethanol. After incubation at room temperature
in the dark for 1 h, complete alkylation was assured by
the addition of 15 mg (10 equiv./mol of thiol) of iodo-
acetic acid. The pH of the solution was immediately re-
adjusted to pH 8.3 with 0.1 M-NH3 solution and incu-
bated for a further 60 min in the dark at room tem-
perature. The S-carboxymethylated protein was desalted
on a Sephadex G-25 (fine grade) column (2 cm x 50 cm)
in 10 mM-HCl and freeze-dried.
Tryptic cleavage
Trypsin [bovine pancreas, twice crystallized, treated
with L-N-tosylphenylalanylchloromethane ('TPCK')]
was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and was further
purified by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. before use according to
the method of Titani et al. (1982). A 500 ,ug portion of S-
carboxymethylated chymopapain was dissolved in 1 ml
of 50 mM-ammoflium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, trypsin
was added in a 1:100 (w/w) ratio and the mixture was
incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, after which the addition of
trypsin and the incubation were repeated. The reaction
mixture was then freeze-dried. The resultant tryptic-
digest peptides were fractionated by elution with an
acetonitrile (BDH Chemicals, Toronto, Ont., Canada)
gradient (1 %/min) in 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid
(BDH Chemicals) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min from a
Synchropak RP-8 column (4.1 mm x 250 mm) (Syn-

chrom, Linden, IN, U.S.A.) previously equilibrated in
0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.0. The effluent was
monitored at 220 nm and individual peptides were col-
lected and freeze-dried. Those peptides that displayed
signs of heterogeneity, either by distortion in peak shape
or after amino acid composition analysis and sequencing,
were re-fractionated on an identical Synchropak RP-8
column at pH 7.0 in 10 mM-ammonium acetate. Elution
of the peptides was achieved by a linear gradient (0-50 %O)
generated from 50 % (v/v) propan- 1-ol in water at a flow
rate of 0.8 ml/min.
Limited peptic cleavage
A 4 mg portion of S-carboxymethylated chymopapain
was dissolved in 1 ml of 5 % (v/v) acetic acid. Pepsin
(1:2000 w/w) was added to the chymopapain solution
and digestion was allowed to continue for 1 h at 4 'C. At
the end of this time the reaction was stopped by the
addition of pepstatin (10 times the weight of pepsin
used). The digestion mixture was applied to a Sephadex
G-50 (superfine grade) column (1.5 cm x 400 cm) equili-
brated in 10 mM-HCl. Elution was with that solvent, and
the fractions of interest were pooled and freeze-dried.
Re-fractionation was performed by either cation-
exchange chromatography or reverse-phase h.p.l.c. Ion-
exchange chromatography was performed on Whatman
CM-52 CM-cellulose. The freeze-dried material was
redissolved in 2 ml of 10 mM-sodium acetate buffer,
pH 3.8, and applied to a column (0.9 cm x 30 cm) pre-
viously equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was
washed with 50 ml of buffer, followed by a salt gradient
(2 x 200 ml, 0.1-1.0 M-NaCl) in the same buffer at a flow
rate of 20 ml/h. Eluted peptides were detected at 230 nm,
and pooled fractions were freeze-dried and desalted on a
Sephadex G-25 (fine grade) column (2 cm x 50 cm) in
10 mM-HCl. Reverse-phase h.p.l.c. was performed on an
Altex Ultrapore RPSC C3 column (Beckman Instru-
ments, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.) with a Varian 5000 liquid
chromatograph. The freeze-dried material, dissolved in
500 1l of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, was injected on to
the column, which had been previously equilibrated in
0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was with a linear
acetonitrile gradient [0-60 % (v/v) at 1 %/min] in 0.05
trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.
Cleavage with CNBr at methionine and tryptophan
residues
Cleavage ofpeptide bonds adjacent to both methionine
and tryptophan residues was effected by using CNBr in
the presence of heptafluorobutyric acid and formic acid
according to the method of Ozols & Gerard (1977). A
1.5 mg portion of S-carboxymethylated chymopapain
was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 88 % (v/v) formic acid. Then
1 ml ofanhydrous heptafluorobutyric acid (Beckman Ins-
truments) was added followed by the addition of25 mg of
solid CNBr. The reaction vial was flushed with Ar,
sealed, and incubated in the dark at room temperature
for 24 h with continual stirring. The reagent and solvent
were removed under a stream of N2, and the remaining
material was resuspended in 10 ml of Milli-Q water
(Millipore, Beford, MA, U.S.A.) and freeze-dried. That
process was repeated before h.p.l.c. fractionation. The
resultant CNBr-cleavage peptides were separated by
elution with an acetonitrile gradient (0-60 %/ at 1 O/min)
in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min
from an Altex Ultrapore RPSC C3 column (Beckman
Instruments) previously equilibrated in 0.05% tri-
fluoroacetic acid. The effluent was monitored at 220 nm,
and individual peptides were collected and freeze-dried.
Mild acid cleavage
Cleavage of the large CNBr-cleavage fragment CB3
at aspartic acid/asparagine residues was performed by
incubation in 0.25 M-acetic acid under vacuum [2.7 kPa
(20 mTorr)] at 110 °C for 8 h (Schroeder et al., 1963)
followed by freeze-drying. The peptides produced were
fractionated by elution from an Ultrapore RPSC C3
column in the same manner as described for the CNBr-
cleavage mixture.
Disulphide bridge assignment
Disulphide bridge assignments were made after the
isolation and identification of disulphide-bonded pep-
tides by the mapping of tryptic digests. To minimize
disulphide bond cleavage and re-arrangement, the tryptic
digestion was performed at pH 5.8. A 1.0 mg portion of
chymopapain was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM-ammonium
acetate buffer, pH 5.8, and trypsin was added to give a
final concentration of 1:100 (w/w). The mixture was
incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, after which the addition of
trypsin and incubation were repeated. The digest was
freeze-dried, redissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid
and fractionated as described above for tryptic peptides.
Re-fractionation of individual peaks was performed at
pH 5.8 in 10 mM-ammonium acetate buffer by reverse-
phase h.p.l.c. One-fifth of each peak was taken for
sequence analysis to identify those containing disulphide-
bonded peptides. These fractions were subsequently
oxidized with performic acid, freeze-dried and subjected
to sequence analysis.
Automated gas-phase and liquid-phase sequence analysis
Automated gas-phase sequencing was performed on
an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, U.S.A.) 475A
protein sequencing system with 0.1-0.5 nmol quantities
of purified peptides. The samples were dissolved in 30 ,u
of Milli-Q water and applied to a glass-fibre disc con-
taining 1.5 mg of precycled Polybrene (Applied Bio-
systems). In automated liquid-phase sequencing a Beck-
man 890C sequencer was used with 5-10 nmol of purified
peptides, and sequential Edman degradation was per-
formed with the use of a 0.5 M-Quadrol program (Beck-
man program no. 111978). The phenylthiohydantoin
derivatives of amino acids were identified by h.p.l.c. on a
Varian Vista-56 liquid chromatograph with an IBM-
cyano column (4.5 mm x 25 cm) (IBM Instruments, Meri-
den, CT, U.S.A.) maintained at 37 °C in 5 % (v/v)
tetrahydrofuran/30 mM-sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.1,
with gradient elution using 100% acetonitrile.
Amino acid composition analysis
Amino acid composition analyses of protein and of
purified peptides were performed with a Durrum D-500
analyser. Protein samples (70 ,g) were hydrolysed in
vacuo [2.7 kPa (20 mTorr)] at 110 °C in 6 M-HCl (Ari-
staR; BDH Chemicals) for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h to correct
for hydrolytic losses. Tryptophan was determined after
hydrolysis in 4 M-methanesulphonic acid containing
0.2% 3-(2-aminoethyl)indole (Pierce Chemical Co., Rock-
ford, IL, U.S.A.) at 110 °C for 20 h in vacuo. The
1990
76
Amino acid sequence of chymopapain
combined cystine and cysteine content of chymopapain
was determined after oxidation to cysteic acid (Hirs,
1967) and acid hydrolysis in 6 M-HCI at 1 10 °C for 24 h.
Purified peptides were hydrolysed as described above
except that no corrections were made for hydrolytic
losses.
RESULTS
Chymopapain is a 218-amino acid-residue polypeptide,
as determined by sequence analysis (Fig. 1) and confirmed
by amino acid composition analysis (Table 1). It contains
a total of eight cysteic acid residues after oxidation. To
facilitate the identification of these residues, we used S-
carboxy[14C]methylated chymopapain, which provided
us with a secondary means of identification of cysteine
residues in addition to the phenylthiohydantoin elution
profiles. N-Terminal sequence analysis of the intact
protein allowed unambiguous identification up to amino
acid residue 40, at which point the sequence was no
longer discernible from the background noise.
77
Cleavage of chymopapain with trypsin
Amino acid composition analysis (Table 1) showed the
presence of 21 lysine and five arginine residues, giving a
total of 26 potential trypsin-cleavage sites. A 500 ,ug
portion of protein was subjected to tryptic digestion and
the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase
h.p.l.c. (Fig. 2). Samples of each purified peptide were
removed for amino acid composition analysis (Table I of
Supplementary Publication SUP 50153) and sequence
analysis.
By comparison with the known primary structure of
papain (Cohen et al., 1986) and actinidin (Carne &
Moore, 1978), tentative alignment of most of the tryptic-
digest peptides of chymopapain was possible. This in-
cluded tentative assignment of peptide T22 to the C-
terminal position because of its lack of a C-terminal
lysine or arginine residue.
Limited peptic cleavage

Subsequent sequence analysis of the peptic peptides
(P1-P7) resulted in the overlapping ofmost of the tryptic-
digest peptides (Fig. 1).
4 4 13 CNBr cleavage
As sequence analysis of the tryptic-digest and peptic-
digest peptides did not give total overlap, the CNBr-
cleavage reaction at both methionine and tryptophan
residues (Ozols & Gerard, 1977) was employed. After
separation by h.p.l.c. on an Altex Ultrapore RPSC
column in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, six homogeneous3 fragments were obtained (Fig. 4). Subsequent sequence
analysis of fragments CBI-CB6 completed the over-
lapping procedure for the entire 218 amino acid residues.
However, the largest CNBr-cleavage fragment, CB3 (Fig.u 4), which spanned residues 27-181, was further cleaved
by mild acid hydrolysis (Schroeder et al., 1963). The
fragments were fractionated by h.p.l.c. in 0.05 0 tri-
fluoroacetic acid on an Ultrapore RPSC column (Fig. 4

acetate buffer. The sequence analysis of chymopapain
shows the presence of eight half-cystine and cysteine
residues within the molecule. Assuming that one of these,
namely Cys-25, is the active-site cysteine residue and
cannot be involved in disulphide bridge formation,
probably six of the remaining residues form disulphide
bridges and the seventh is a secondary free thiol moeity.
By comparison of the elution profiles of the tryptic maps
of S-carboxymethylated chymopapain (Fig. 2) and that
of native chymopapain (Fig. 5) it can be seen that
differences in elution times and elution patterns exist.
The suspected disulphide-bonded peptide fractions were
isolated and re-fractionated at pH 5.8 in ammonium
acetate buffer, to ensure homogeneity.
Analysis of fraction 8 (Fig. 5) gave sequences of two
peptides corresponding to residues 146-156 and residues
196-208, indicating that the half-cystine residues at
positions 153 and 204 are disulphide-bonded. Likewise,
analysis of fraction 11 (Fig. 5) gave two sequences
corresponding to residues 18-39 and residues 59-64:
hence cystine residues 22 and 63 are disulphide-bonded.
Analysis of fraction 12 (Fig. 5) allowed the assignment of
the third disulphide bond between half-cystine residues
56 and 95, as this fraction generated two sequences
corresponding to residues 40-58 and residues 95-96.
Finally, analysis of fraction 14 (Fig. 5) gave a single
sequence corresponding to residues 113-139, indicating
that the cysteine residue at position 117 constitutes a
secondary free thiol group that is additional to the
active-site cysteine residue at position 25. Fractions 8, 11
and 12 were further subjected to performic acid oxidation
and individually separated by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. (Fig.
6). Sequence analysis of these separated disulphide-
bonded peptides confirmed the designation ofhalf-cystine
residues in disulphide bridges.
DISCUSSION
The sequence reported here is identical with that found
by A. G. Schnek and co-workers (personal communi-
cation), even though the chymopapains were isolated
from papaya latexes from completely different
sources, and were purified by somewhat different means.
It is thus reasonable to conclude that the two laboratories
have each isolated the major form of chymopapain in
papaya latex. A number of other chymopapains have
been found in that source, and some are closely related,
in size and amino acid composition, to the molecule
discussed here (Ebata & Yasunobu, 1962; Kunimitsu &
Yasunobu, 1967; Lynn, 1979; Kahn & Polgair, 1983).
However, defining that relationship requires structural
studies not yet available. Buttle & Barrett (1984) have
previously shown that the multiple forms ofchymopapain
that they separated are immunologically identical, and
concluded that chymopapain is a single enzyme.
We have restricted comparison of the sequence of
chymopapain to papain and papaya proteinase Q, which
are also isolated from papaya latex. In general terms, the
similarities between the three sequences (Fig. 7) are
greatest near the N- and C-terminals, but structural
similarities occur throughout. Residues generally agreed
to be essential for the activity, namely Cys-25, Asp-158

and His- 159, with Trp- 177 and Asn- 175, are all conserved
in chymopapain and papaya proteinase Q. There are
between chymopapain and papain 127 identities out of
212 possibilities, and between chymopapain and papaya
proteinase Q 144 identities in 216 residues.
On examining the sequences of Fig. 7, three notable
areas of difference are found. Chymopapain has eight
cysteine residues whereas papain and papaya proteinase
Q each has seven. The three disulphide bonds of the
molecules are formed in identical ways (Fig. 8), the
seventh cysteine residue being the residue essential for
activity, at position 25. In chymopapain, uniquely, resi-
due 117 is a cysteine. By using the three-dimensional
model published by Drenth and co-workers (Kamphuis
et al., 1984) for papain as guide, position 117 of chymo-
papain is probably on the surface of the molecule. In the
sequence it is remote from the closest cysteine residue
(Cys-95) and is, furthermore, on a different domain, so
interaction between them is unlikely to occur. Similarly,
the other cysteine residues of chymopapain are distant
from position 117, which is thus not expected to be an
alternative site for intramolecular disulphide bond for-
mation, which could produce other forms of chymo-
papain (Ebata & Yasunobu, 1962; Kunimitsu & Yasuno-
bu, 1967; Lynn, 1979). The exterior position of Cys- 117
would facilitate its engagement in intermolecular di-
sulphide bonds, but we have found no evidence in the
literature for the existence of dimeric forms of chymo-
papain. The exposed site of Cys- 117 would make it
susceptible to oxidation, which has been reported in
studies of the second free thiol group of chymopapain
(Baines & Brocklehurst, 1982). It may be noted that the
N-terminal side of the sequence leading to this cysteine
residue resembles that reported by Tsunoda & Yasunobu
(1966) as occurring about the reactive thiol group of
chymopapain. Apparently their derivative-forming re-
agent preferentially bound to the more exposed free thiol
group and not, as they assumed, to that essential for
catalysis.
Another difference between chymopapain and papain
is that the former (like papaya proteinase Q) contains
four residues (169-172) more between residues 168 and
169 of the papain sequence. Similar insertions are also
found in actinidin, the cysteine proteinase from Actinidia
chinensis, for which the three-dimensional structure has
been published (Baker, 1980) and compared with that of
papain (Kamphuis et al., 1985). The insertions are then
seen to extend two adjacent fl-sheets.
The S2 subsite in papain may be defined (Drenth et al.,
1976) by Tyr-67, Pro-68, Val-133, Val-157, Ala-160 and
Ser-205. These residues are identical in papaya proteinase
Qi, but in chymopapain are Tyr-67, Gln-68, Leu- 133,
Leu- 157, Ala- 160 and Ser-205. The substitution of the
more bulky groups in chymopapain should affect the
reactivities of the enzyme such that smaller groups at P2
will provide more effective substrates, and the replace-
ment by Gln-68 of proline is also expected to alter the
reactivity of this subsite. There are not sufficient kinetic
data available from reactions of chymopapain to test
these predictions.
Although the data of Fig. 7 show that other differences
between the enzymes exist, their significance cannot be
established until high-resolution structures of all three are
defined.
