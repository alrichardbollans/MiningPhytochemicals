Abstract-The presence of theobromine (up to 0.14%) and of caffeine (up to 0.76%) has been established for the first 
time in beans from two populations of Coffea lancifolia (A320 and A405) and in one population of C. kianjavatensis 
(A213). This indicates that the Mascarocoffea, once thought to be purine-free, includes some members storing methyl 
xanthines in seeds, but the virtual absence of caffeine from another C. kianjavatensis (A602), and of both caffeine and 
theobromine from three populations of C .  lzomollei (A574, A743 and SZ108)indicates the biochemical diversity of these 
taxa. 
INTRODUCTION 
Mascarocoffea, the wild coffees of Madagascar and neigh- 
bouring islands, have been divided morphologically into 
seven botanical ‘Séries’ [l, 21, but only Ca 20 taxa therein 
have been studied from a chemical point of view. Cheval- 
ier [ 11 believed the Mascarocoffea were caffeine-free, and 
until recently this belief had been substantiated by many 
investigations [3-81 which found not more than 0.07% 
caffeine, and that only in a single taxon, C .  mauritiana [3, 
41. Recently, however, it has been established that the 
beans of at least one population (A213) of C .  kianjavaten- 
sis contain caffeine at up to 0.81% db [SI. This observa- 
tion indicated the need for our previous chemotaxonomic 
studies [lo, 111 of Coffea spp. and Psilanthus spp. to be 
extended to the seven ‘Séries’ of the Mascarocoffea, and a 
comprehensive study of over 100 samples has com- 
menced. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Aqueous extracts prepared from ground green beans 
were analysed for their caffeine contents by GC. Observa- 
tion of a second purine-like peak during confirmatory 
HPLC led to the isolation of the chlorsform-soluble 
components by preparative XPLC and their character- 
ization by physical methods. 
The retention time, W and EI mass spectra (70 eV) of 
the two components were indistinguishable from auth- 
entic caffeine and theobromine. Caffeine m/z 194 (100); 
109 (61); 55 (52); 67 (32); 82 (28); 137 (8). Theobromine 
m/z 180 (100); 55 (58); 67 (51); 109 (39); 82 (38); 137 (8). The 
quantitative G C  and HPLC data for caffeine and the 
HPLC data for theobromine are presented in Table 1. 
The values for caffeine obtained by HPLC are slightly, 
but not significantly, smaller than those obtained by GC, 
but both sets are consistent with the data (not shown)

This short communication constitutes the first report 
of theobromine, in at  least some populations from two 
taxa of the Mascarocoffeu. We further demonstrate that 
members of the 'Série Verae' of Mascarocofleu are bio- 
chemically diverse as there are significant quantities of: 
(i) caffeine in the green beans of C. Zancifolia (A320, A405) 
and C.  kianjavatensis (A213), but it is lacking from 
C. kianjauatensis (A602) and C. homoZlei (A574, A743 and 
SZlOS); (ii) theobromine in beans from C. ZancifoZia 
(A320, A405), C. kianjauatensis (A213, A602), but not in 
beans of the three populations of C. homoZlei investigated. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials. All bean samples were supplied by the Research 
Centre of Kianjavato, FO. FI. FA,, Madagascar. Cofea 
kianjauatensis, C. lancifolia and C. homollei belong to the 'Série 
verae' of the Mascarocoffea [l, 13,14J. All reagents were normal 
commercial items of good quality. 
Methods. Ground green coffee (1 g) was refluxed in boiling 
water containing MgO for 30 min [IS]. After filtration and the 
addition of int. standard (5-aminoquinoline), caffeine was deter- 
mined on a Hewlett Packard 5710A gas chromatograph equip- 
ped with a NPFID detector. A I m  glass column packed with 
Chromosorb AWHMDS and coated with 3% carbowax 20 M, 
operating at 215" with a 40 ml min-' N, flow rate was used for 
separation. 
For theobromine and caffeine analysis by HPLC the aqueous 
phase as obtained above was extracted x 4 (v/v) with CHCI,. 
The pooled extracts were dried over Na,SO, and evapd to 
dryness, dissolved in lOml MeOH and analysed by HPLC using 
external standards for quantification. Analytical HPLC separa- 
tion was achieved on a Lichrospher 5RP18 column (4.6 
x 250") using a 1 ml min-' flow rate and a gradient from 5% 
MeOH in 2mM H,PO, to 100% MeOH in 48 min. Prep. HPLC 
was similarly performed, but using a Lichrosorb 10 RP18 (10 
x 250 mm) column and a 2 ml min- flow rate. Mass spectra: EI 
mode at 70 eV. The source temperature was 250" with desorp- 
tion over the range 20" to 250".
