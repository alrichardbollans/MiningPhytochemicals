To understand the role of GAsin dormancy induction, endogenous GAs have been identified byKovats retention indices and full mass spectra from capillary gaschromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of purified extractfrom dormant bulbils of Dioscorea opposita Thunb. These includeGA4, GA9, GA12, GA19, GA20, GA24, GA36, and GA53; their presencesuggests the occurrence of two biosynthetic pathways in D. oppos-ita bulbils, the early 13-hydroxylation pathway and the non-13-hydroxylation pathway.It is well known that dormancy of many plant species (15)can be broken by application of GAs'. Endogenous GAs arebelieved to be a group of plant hormones that break dor-mancy and initiate germination and sprouting. In contrast,application of GA3 strengthens or deepens the dormancy ofseeds or buds of several species (3-5, 8, 10-14, 17). Amongthese species, promotion of sprouting of half-dormant bulbilsand subterranean tubers by inhibitors of GA biosynthesis,such as N-dimethylaminosuccinamic acid, 2-chloroethyl-tri-methyl ammonium chloride, and AMO 1618 was observedin some species in the genus Dioscorea (11, 12). This is alsothe effect of uniconazole, a triazole-type growth retardant,on bulbils of Dioscorea spp. (our unpublished data). There-fore, it is most likely that endogenous GAs are involved ininduction and maintenance of dormancy of seeds (10), bulbils(11, 12), and subterranean tubers (12, 13) in the genusDioscorea.Investigation of the dynamics of endogenous GAs in dor-mant organs is important for understanding the roles of GAsin both dormancy inducing or maintaining and dormancybreaking. However, there has been no literature concerningGA dynamics in dormant organs whose dormancy was in-duced either naturally, presumably by endogenous GAs, orby GA3 application. To get information necessary for under-standing natural or GA-induced dormancy, we analyzedendogenous GAs in dormant bulbils of D. opposita and iden-tified several GAs.1 Abbreviations: GA., gibberellin A,;, EtOAc, ethyl acetate; HOAc,acetic acid; KRI, Kovats retention index; Me, methyl; MeOH, meth-anol; ODS, octadecylsilane; TMS, trimethylsilyl.MATERIALS AND METHODSExtraction and PurificationDormant, mature bulbils of Chinese yam, Dioscorea oppos-ita Thunb., which naturally shed from the cultivated motherplants, were collected in November 1988 and immediatelystored at -400C until extracted. As much as 51.2 kg of thebulbils were extracted three times using 200 L of acetone.The acetone was evaporated, and the resultant aqueous phasewas adjusted with HCl to pH 2.4 and partitioned five timesagainst 3.6 L of EtOAc, which was concentrated in vacuo tobrown gum (26 g). This was dissolved in 500 mL of 0.1 Mphosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and then loaded onto a column ofpolyvinylpolypyrrolidone (500 g; Tokyo Kasei Co., Tokyo,Japan). The buffer eluate (4 L) was acidified and partitionedfour times against 2 L of EtOAc. The organic phases wereconcentrated in vacuo to 5.34 g of brown oil. This oil wasdissolved in 40 mL of 70% MeOH (0.1% HOAc), loaded ontoa column of ODS (100 g; Senshu Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo,Japan), and eluted with 1 L of 70% MeOH (0.1% HOAc). Itsconcentrate of brown oil (3.78 g) was dissolved in 100 mL ofMeOH and loaded onto a column of diethylaminopropyl(50.2 g; Bondesil, Analytichem International, Harbor City,CA). The column was eluted successively with 840 mL ofMeOH and 2.1 L of 0.75% HOAc in MeOH. The concentrate(1.62 g of brown oil) of the latter was dissolved in 57 mL of15% acetone and loaded onto a column of charcoal (15.3 g;Wako Pure Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The concentrate(920 mg of gum) from the eluates with 35 to 100% aqueousacetone was dissolved in 3.5 mL of 30% MeOH (0.1% HOAc)and then centrifuged at 3000g. The supernatant was equallydivided into two parts, which were separately purified byHPLC on a Senshu-Pak ODS column (particle size, 5 nm; 20mm i.d. x 25 cm; Senshu Scientific Co., Ltd.). The mobilephase was supplied at a flow rate of 9.9 mL/min at 400C,with an isocratic elution of 45% MeOH (0.1% HOAc) for 30min, an increasing linear gradient elution of 45 to 70% MeOH(0.1% HOAc) for 10 min, an isocratic elution of 70% MeOH(0.1% HOAc) for 40 min, and finally a decreasing lineargradient to 45% MeOH (0.1% HOAc) for 10 min. The eluatewas collected every 1.5 min. The corresponding fractionsobtained from two runs were combined.The active fractions were further purified on a Senshu-Pakdimethylamino silica column (particle size, 5 nm; 6 mm i.d.x 25 cm). The mobile phase was MeOH (0.05% HOAc)1823 www.plantphysiol.orgon May 8, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1992 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.Plant Physiol.

The KRI was calculated according to the method ofKovats (7).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn a preliminary experiment using the bioassay, the GAcontent in bulbils of D. opposita was found to be extremelylow. To enable GC-MS analysis of the endogenous GAs, 51.2kg of the bulbils were used in this study. An acidic EtOAcfraction of the bulbils was successively purified using col-umns of polyvinylpolypyrollidone, ODS, diethylaminopro-pyl, and charcoal. The partially purified extract was chro-matographed on a reversed phase column, and the six zones(A-F) with biological activity that resulted were examined bythe modified dwarf rice microdrop bioassay (9) (Fig. 1).Fraction F was methylated with diazomethane and analyzedby GC-MS, resulting in the identification of GA12 (Table Iand Fig. 2). Actual identification of GA12 as an endogenousGA, particularly in higher plants such as D. opposita (Fig. 2),Pisum sativum (18), and Lilium longiflorum (1) is rare, in spiteof its widely accepted presence as a theoretical intermediatein the biosynthesis of GAs. Fractions A to E were separatelypurified by dimethylamino silica-HPLC. Thus, the followingbioactive fractions were obtained: E16 (fraction 16) and E25/26 (fractions 25 and 26) from fraction E, D7 and D10/11from fraction D, C24 from fraction C, B19 from fraction B,and A16 from fraction A. These seven bioactive fractionswere analyzed by GC-MS after methylation and trimethyl-silylation and were identified as GA9Me, GA24Me,GA53MeTMS, GA4MeTMS, GA19MeTMS, GA36MeTMS, andGA20MeTMS. The results of KRI and full scan mass spectraare summarized in Table I. The mass spectrum ofGA36MeTMS (fraction B19) is shown in Figure 3. GA36 hadbeen considered to be a typical fungal GA (2) until it wasidentified from vascular plants, a fern (16), and a monoco-tyledon (6). The present identification of GA36 may be thesecond example of its occurrence in monocotyledons.The presence of GA53, GA19, and GA20 (Table I) is indic-ative of the early 13-hydroxylation pathway operating inD. opposita, although GA1 has not yet been identified,possibly because of its low concentration. The occurrence ofGA12, GA4, GA9, GA24, and GA36 (Table I) in D. oppositasuggests the presence of two non-13-hydroxylation path-ways, in which GA4 might be converted from GA24 either viaGA9 or GA36.It seems that such endogenous GAs might be involved ina physiological mechanism of dormancy in the bulbils.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to express our cordial thanks to the PesticideLaboratory, Department of Agricultural Chemistry, the University ofTokyo, for use of the facilities for extraction and GC-MS.
