Blocking the polyol pathway plays an important role preventing diabetic complications. Therefore, aldose reductase (AR) and
advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) formation has significant effect on diabetic complications. Artemisia iwayomogi has long
been used as treatment of various diseases in Korea. However, no literatures have reported on AR and AGEs formation inhibitory
activities of A. iwayomogi. For these reasons, we aimed to assess that A. iwayomogi had potential as anti-diabetic complications
agents. We led to isolation of two coumarins (1 and 2), nine flavonoids (3–11), five caffeoylquinic acids (12–16), three diterpene
glycosides (17–19), and one phenolic compound (20) from A. iwayomogi. Among them, hispidulin (4), 6-methoxytricin (6),
arteanoflavone (7), quercetin-3-gentiobioside (10), 1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (13), and suaviosideA (18) were first reported on the
isolation fromA. iwayomogi. Not only two coumarins (1 and 2), nine flavonoids (3–11), and five caffeoylquinic acids (12–16) but also
extracts showed significant inhibitor on AR and AGEs formation activities. We analyzed contents of major bioactive compounds
in Korea’s various regions of A. iwayomogi. Overall, we selected Yangyang, Gangwon-do, from June, which contained the highest
amounts of bioactive compounds, as suitable areas for cultivating A. iwayomogi as preventive or therapeutic agent in the treatment
of diabetic complications.
1. Introduction
Aldose reductase (AR) belongs to the aldo-keto reductase
family. It is the first and rate-controlling enzyme in the polyol
pathway that reduces glucose to sorbitol using nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide 2󸀠-phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor
[1, 2]. Although blood sugar is high, the polyol pathway
converts the excess glucose into sorbitol and then fructose.
This accumulation of sorbitol and fructose has been demon-
strated to be responsible for diabetic complications, including
nephropathy, cataracts, neuropathy, and retinopathy [3, 4].
In particular, sorbitol is implicated in the pathogenesis of
sugar cataracts, while the accumulation of fructose induces
the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs),
which are strongly implicated in diabetic complications and
Alzheimer’s disease [5]. Therefore, research on AR and
AGEs formation inhibition is on the rise. There is a wide
range of literature demonstrating that the developments of
AR and AGEs formation are blocked by natural sources,
especially plants that have an enormous content of bioactive
compounds [6, 7].
Artemisia iwayomogi, locally called haninjin or dowijigi,
is a member of the Compositae family and a perennial herb
mainly found in Korea. A. iwayomogi has long been used in
Korea in vegetables and foods such as tea, rice cake, and soup
and also used for the treatment of various diseases including
hepatitis, inflammation, and immune-related diseases as a
protection for the liver, and a diuretic [8–10]. Previous
studies have reported the isolation of scopoletin, esculetin 6-
methylether, scopolin, 𝛽-sitosterol, chlorogenic acid, quebra-
chitol, essential oils, fatty acids, sesquiterpene lactones, and
flavonoids in A. iwayomogi [11–14]. Among them, scopolin
modulated the expression of obesity-associated genes and
was shown to have pharmacological effects on obesity, fatty

liver, and diabetes [15]. A. iwayomogi has also demonstrated
various biological activities. For example, methanol extracts
of A. iwayomogi were shown to act as a scavenger of pero-
xynitrile, a compound involved in inducing or maintain-
ing many diseases, including inflammation and aging [16].
Methanol extract of A. iwayomogi also inhibits nitric oxide
in the production of lipopolysaccharide activated macro-
phages [17]. In other studies, a water-soluble carbohydrate
fraction from A. iwayomogi suppressed spontaneous or 2,3,
7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced apoptotic death of
mouse thymocytes by downregulating Fas gene expression
[18, 19]. A water-soluble carbohydrate fraction from A. iway-
omogi also repressed pulmonary eosinophilia and Th2-type
cytokine production in ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma
via downregulation of TNF-𝛼 expression in the lungs [20],
showed antitumor, immunomodulating activities [9], and
modulated the functional differentiation of bone marrow-
derived dendritic cells [21].
However, A. iwayomogi’s ability to inhibit AR and AGEs
formation has never been previously studied. We investi-
gated various components found in A. iwayomogi and their
inhibitory activities on AR and AGEs formation. Our study
also determined the bioactive compounds present in A.
iwayomogi by region in Korea using an HPLC-PAD. Based
on our study, we selected suitable areas for cultivating A.
iwayomogi as medicinal foods.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Plant Materials. The aerial parts of A. iwayomogi
were purchased from Kyung-Dong market, Seoul, Korea.
Moreover, the aerial parts of A. iwayomogi were collected
from Seoul, Gyeongii-do, Chungcheongbuk-do, Jeollabuk-
do, Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do,
Gangwon-do, and Jeju-do Korea for analysis. Professor
Whang Wan Kyunn identified A. iwayomogi which was
bought inKyung-Dongmarket and collected in various speci-
mens.
2.2. Instruments and Reagents. Toluene, ethyl formate, chlo-
roform (CHCl3), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH),
ethanol (EtOH), distilled water, and formic acid were
used as the open column chromatography and thin layer
chromatography. Open column chromatography was used
with Amberlite gel (Nippon Rensui Co., Japan), silica gel
(200∼400mesh; Merck Co., Germany), Sephadex LH-20
(25–100 𝜇m; Pharmacia, Sweden), MCI CHP 20P (Supelco,
USA), and ODS gel (400–500mesh; Waters, USA). Thin
layer chromatography was conducted with a Kiesel gel 60
F254 (Merck Co., Darmstadt, Germany) and plates (silica gel,
0.25mm layer on aluminum sheets), and compounds were
profiled by spraying with 10% H2SO4 in EtOH, followed
by heating to 110∘C. Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6),
methanol-d6 (CD3OD), and pyridine-d6 were used as the
NMR solution. MS was performed using fast atom bombard-
ment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) conducted using a JEOL
JMS-600W (Tokyo, Japan) mass spectrometer, a Q-TOF
Synapt G2 apparatus (Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA)
equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI), and electrospray
ionization hybrid linear trap-quadruple-orbitrap (ESI/LTQ-
Orbitrap) using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC (Thermo, Germany).
1H and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were
conducted at 600MHz and 150MHz, respectively, with a Var-
ianGemini 2000 (USA) spectrometer using tetramethylsilane
(TMS) as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are expressed
as parts per million (ppm) on the 𝛿 scale, and coupling
constants (J) are showed in Hertz. HPLC was conducted
using Empower Pro 2.0 software and determination was per-
formed using a Waters 2695 system pump with a Waters 996
Photodiode array detector (USA). The separation column
was a Waters Sunfire column C18 (4.6 × 250mm, 5 𝜇m).
HPLC-grade solvents such as acetonitrile (ACN), methanol
(MeOH), and distilled water (H2O) were purchased from J.
T. Baker (Phillipsburg, PA, USA). HPLC-grade formic acid
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from DEA-
JUNG Chemical (Siheung, Gyeonggi, Korea). Reagents and
solvents including dl-glyceraldehyde, potassium phosphate
buffer, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2󸀠-phosphate (𝛽-
NADPH), sodium phosphate buffer, sodium azide, 3,3-
tetramethyleneglutaric acid (TMG), bovine serum albumin,
aminoguaidine (AG), glucose, and fructose were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
2.3. Extraction, Fractionation, and Isolation from A. iway-
omogi. The dried and powdered aerial parts of A. iwayomogi
(5 kg) were extracted with 50% EtOH (20 L × 3) at room tem-
perature. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness (692.1 g)
in vacuo, suspended in water (H2O), and then partitioned
using CHCl3 (97.6 g). After partitioning, the water fraction
(456.7 g) was chromatographed on a Amberlite XAD-2 using
water, 30% methanol, 60% methanol, and 100% methanol.
The result yielded water (240 g), 30%methanol (92.18 g), 60%
methanol (49.31 g), and 100% methanol (70.24 g) fractions.

raphy with 20% MeOH, and ten fractions (16-1∼16-10) were
collected. Fraction 16-6 (134.3mg) led to the isolation of
compound 14 (70.0mg) by recrystallization. Fraction 16-5
(395.7mg) was separated by a Sephadex LH-20 using an
eluent of 40%EtOH, which yielded compounds 15 (272.2mg)
and 16 (72.2mg).
The 60% MeOH fraction (49.31 g) was separated using
a Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography with a gradient
of 40% MeOH to 100% MeOH, which yielded twelve sub-
fractions. Subfraction 1 (6.7 g) was separated by an MCI gel
using a 50% MeOH to 100% MeOH solvent system, which
yielded fifteen fractions (1-1∼1-15). Fractions 1-8 (331.6 mg),

tallization to yield compounds 17 (32.7mg), 18 (9.2mg),
and 19 (28.6mg), respectively. Subfraction 3 (923.4mg) was
separated using an ODS column chromatography, and seven
fractions (3-1∼3-7) were collected after elution with 40%
MeOH. Fraction 3-3 (140.4mg) was separated by MCI col-
umn chromatography using an eluent of 50%MeOH, leading
to the isolation of compound 20. Subfraction 5 (1.48 g) was
separated using an MCI gel and eluted with 50% MeOH,
which yielded compound 8 (281.7mg). A portion of fraction
5-3 (166.2mg) was applied to an MCI gel and eluted with
40% MeOH. Fraction 5-3-3 (106mg) was separated by a
Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography using an eluent of
50% EtOH to yield compounds 10 (23.1mg) and 11 (36.8mg).
Subfraction 7 (806.2mg) and subfraction 8 (3. 77 g) were
chromatographed on an MCI gel using 40% MeOH, to give
fractions 7-1∼7-10 and 8-1∼8-12, respectively. Compound 9
(76.6mg) was isolated from fraction 7-4 (108.8mg) using a
Sephadex LH-20 eluting with 50% EtOH. Subfraction 8-2
(3.77 g) was separated using a Sephadex LH-20 eluting with
40% MeOH. Fraction 8-2-3 was applied to a Sephadex LH-
20 column chromatography using 20% EtOH, which yielded
compound 13 (111.1mg).
A portion of the 30% MeOH fraction (14 g) was chro-
matographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography
using a solvent system of 20% MeOH to 100% MeOH,
which yielded seven subfractions. Fraction 2 (7.12mg) was
separated using an ODS column chromatography, and fifteen
fractions (2-1∼2-15) were collected after elution with 5%
MeOH. Subfraction 2-6 was applied to an MCI gel using 5%
EtOH, which yielded compound 2 (171.4mg).
2.4. Measurement of AR Inhibitory Activity. Rat lenses (one
lens per 0.5mL sodium buffer) were obtained from Sprague-
Dawley rats (weighing 250∼280 g). The rat lenses were
homogenized in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (4∘C, 20min). After centrifuga-
tion, the supernatant was used as an enzyme. AR activity
was spectrophotometrically determined by measuring the
decrease in the absorption of 𝛽-NADPH at 340 nm for a
4min period using dl-glyceraldehydes as substrates [22].The
assay mixture contained 1.6mM 𝛽-NADPH, 0.1M potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), AR homogenate, 4M ammonium
sulfate, 0.025M dl-glyceraldehyde, and the sample in 100%
DMSO. The total volume of the assay mixture was 0.3mL
and the reaction was performed in a 96-well plate. 3,3󸀠-
Tetramethylene glutaric acid (TMG), a typical AR inhibitor,
was used as a positive control.
2.5. Measurement of AGEs Formation Inhibitory Activity.
Inhibition of AGEs formation was determined by an assay
containing bovine serum albumin (10mg/mL) in 50mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.02% sodium azide, to which
0.4M fructose and glucose was added. The assay mixture
was incubated at 60∘C for 2 days. After incubating, the
reaction was measured on Fluorescence in a 96-black-well
plate (excitation wavelength 350 nm, emission wavelength
450 nm) [23]. Aminoguaidine (AG) was used as a positive
control.
2.6. For AR and AGEs Formation Inhibition Assays, the
Activity Was Calculated. Inhibition (%): (Ac − As/Ac) × 100.
In AR inhibition activity, Ac is absorbance of control and
As is absorbance of samples. In AGEs formation inhibition
activity, Ac is fluorescence of control and As is fluores-
cence of samples. IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that
gives a 50% inhibition in enzyme activity. IC50 values were
calculated from the least-squares regression line of the log
of concentration plotted against residual activity. All assays
were performed in triplicate. Data was presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD).
2.7. Sample Preparation for HPLC. Samples of A. iwayomogi
taken from the various regions in Korea and Yangyang,
Gangwon-do, monthly between June and October were dis-
solved in 50% EtOH (20mg/mL). The resulting solution was
filtered with a 0.45 𝜇m syringe filter. The resulting solution
was used for HPLC analysis.
2.8. HPLC Conditions. AWaters Sunfire column C18 (4.6 ×
250mm, 5 𝜇m)was used for the determination of compounds
1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15.Themobile phase consisted of 0.1%
formic acid (solvent A) and ACN (solvent B). The gradient
solvent system was solvents A and B (85 : 15) and increased
in linear gradients to 84 : 16 for 5min, to 72 : 28 for 5min,
then to 69 : 31 for 5min, and finally to 40 : 60 for 5min. The
injection volumewas 10 𝜇L and the flow rate was 0.9mL/min.
TheUV spectra were recorded at 330 nm for quantification of
compounds. All injections were performed in triplicate.
2.9. Calibration Curve. Stock solutions of compounds 1, 2, 8,
10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 in 50% EtOH were prepared in several
concentrations. Calibration curves of the eight standards
were calculated using concentration (𝑋, 𝜇g/mL), peak area
4 BioMed Research International
(𝑌), and mean value (𝑛 = 3) ± standard deviation. Contents
of the analyte solutions were then determined from the
calibration curves.
2.10. Determination of Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of
Quantification (LOQ). Quantification of the HPLC method
for compounds 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 as a standard
compound was determined by LOD and LOQ. The LOD
and LOQ were defined as detectable concentration of the
compound with a signal to noise (𝑆/𝑁) ratio of ≥3.3 and
≥10, respectively. The percent recovery was evaluated by
calculating the ratio of the amount detected versus the
amount added. The quantity of analysis was subsequently
obtained from the calibration curve.

were 40.99 ± 0.50, 7.29 ± 0.05, 40.81 ± 0.05, and 38.40 ±
0.51 𝜇g/mL, respectively. Compounds 1–20 isolated from A.
iwayomogiwere also tested for inhibition of AGEs formation,
as reported in Table 2. Similar to AR inhibitory activities,
diterpene glycosides (17–19) showed no inhibition of AGEs
formation and compound 20 showed only slight inhibition,
whereas the two coumarins (1 and 2), nine flavonoids (3–11),
and five caffeoylquinic acids (12–16) were all more inhibitory
than AG (IC50 value with 414.77 ± 5.96 𝜇M). Among them,
compound 1, which exhibited minor inhibition on AR,
exhibited the best inhibition of AGEs formation with an IC50
value of 20.71 ± 1.38 𝜇M.
3.4. Simultaneous Quantitative Analysis of Bioactive Com-
pounds in A. iwayomogi to Select Suitable Region in Korea.
Since A. iwayomogi is found mainly in Korea, we collected
15 samples of A. iwayomogi in different regions includ-
ing Seoul, Gyeongii-do, Chungcheongbuk-do, Jeollabuk-
do, Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do,
Gangwon-do, and Jeju-do. The following compounds were
analyzed by HPLC-PAD from these fifteen specimens:
scopoletin (1), scopolin (2), patulein-3-O-glucoside (8),
quercetin-3-gentiobioside (10), rutin (11), 3-O-caffeoylquinic
acid (12), 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (14), and 3,5-di-O-
caffeoylquinic acid (15). They all showed significant inhibi-
tion of either AR or AGEs formation. Compounds 1, 2, 8, 10,
11, 12, 14, and 15 were detected in 14.4, 6.6, 13.3, 12.4, 12.7,
7.6, 16.9, and 15.9min, respectively (Figure 2). To optimize
analytical methods, the standard calibration curve, limit of
detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ) for com-
pounds 1, 2,8, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 aremeasured.The standard
calibration curves of compounds 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, and
15 were detected at linear range 0.1–1000𝜇g/mL. As a result,
the correlation coefficient (𝑟2) of all bioactive compounds is
above 0.999. The values of LOD of compounds 1, 2, 8, 10, 11,
12, 14, and 15 are shown to be 2.80, 0.50, 5.93, 5.08, 4.99, 3.82,
1.81, and 2.38 and the values of LOQ of bioactive compounds
are shown to be 8.49, 1.52, 17.98, 15.41, 15.12, 11.59, 5.48, and
7.21 𝜇g/mL, respectively. Using optimized analyticalmethods,
the amounts of bioactive compounds from A. iwayomogi in
the 15 sampleswere determined (Table 3). As a result, contents
of compounds 1 and 8 were the highest in Seoul (1.38 ±
0.01, 4.80 ± 0.03mg/g, resp.), compound 10 was the highest
in Gyeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do (0.65 ± 0.06mg/g), and
compound 11 was highest in Jeju-do (1.11 ± 0.07mg/g). Fur-
thermore, compounds 2, 12, 14, and 15 were the most abun-
dant in Yangyang, Gangwon-do (1.67 ± 0.02, 33.61 ± 0.48,

exhibited good inhibition activity of AGEs formation while
compounds 12, 14, and 15 were significant inhibitors of both
AR and AGEs formation. Overall, the specimen with the
highest total contents of the most compounds was acquired
in Yangyang, Gangwon-do (Figure 3). We therefore col-
lected new specimens of A. iwayomogi in June, July, August,

4. Discussion
The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has become a massive
health burden significantly decreasing quality of life and
increasing morbidity, all at a huge economic cost. As diabetes
is recognized as a serious disease, diabetic complications are
also recognized as a serious disease. Accordingly, preventing
treatment for diabetic complications is as important as
diabetes and blocking the polyol pathway plays an important
role preventing diabetic complications. Therefore, AR and
AGEs formation inhibitors significantly affected diabetic
complications. Artemisia iwayomogi, locally called haninjin
or dowijigi, is a member of the Compositae family and a
perennial herbmainly found in Korea.A. iwayomogi has long
been used in Korea in foods such as tea, rice cake, and soup
and for the treatment of various diseases. However, previous

literatures did not have reported on inhibitory activities of A.
iwayomogi on AR and AGEs formation. For these reasons, we
aimed to assess Artemisia iwayomogi, which is native plant in
Korea used as usual food, and has potential as anti-diabetic
complications agent to inhibit AR and AGEs formation.
Our research led to the isolation of two coumarins
(1 and 2), nine flavonoids (3–11), five caffeoylquinic acids
(12–16), three diterpene glycosides (17–19), and one phenolic
compound (20). Among them, compounds 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, and
18 were first reported on the isolation from A. iwayomogi.
Compounds 1–20 have various bioactive properties such as
antioxidant, anti-inflammation, antiangiogenesis, and car-
diovascular activity [35–37].
After that, the extracts, fractions, and compounds 1–20
from A. iwayomogi were investigated for inhibition of AR.
The extracts, 30%, 60%, and 100% MeOH fractions from A.
iwayomogi showed significant inhibition of AR more than
TMG, positive control. Among compounds isolated from
A. iwayomogi, compounds 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16
were stronger inhibitors than TMG. Out of these, compound
13 exhibited the strongest inhibition. Previous literature
reported that caffeic acid had no inhibitory activity on
AR but that caffeoyl derivatives are significant inhibitors of
AR [24, 38]. Existence of caffeoyl groups for substituents
such as quinicacid is important parameter for not only AR
inhibitory activity but also various biological activities [39].
Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated relationships
between the inhibitory activity and structure of flavonoids
[4]. They reported that monohydroxyflavones (such as com-
pound 3) are not inhibitors of AR, that flavonoid glucosides
(compounds 8 and 9) are more active than flavonoid diglu-
cosides (compounds 10 and 11), and that flavonoids with a
substituted hydroxyl group (compound 6) are more active
than those with substituted methoxyl groups (compound 7).
Inhibition of AR by flavonoids isolated from A. iwayomogi
in our study demonstrated similar results as previous studies.
We demonstrated the inhibitory activities of not only AR
but also AGEs formation. The CHCl3 fraction from A.
iwayomogi had no inhibitory activity on AR but showed the
best inhibition on AGEs formation. The two coumarins (1
and 2), nine flavonoids (3–11), and five caffeoylquinic acids
(12–16) exhibited also great inhibitory activities more than
AG, positive control. Among them, compound 1 showed
minor inhibition on AR and exhibited the best inhibition
of AGEs formation. Previous literature has reported that the
presence of a methoxyl group at C-6 instead of a hydroxyl
group and a hydroxyl group at C-7 in the coumarin structure
are important parameters in the inhibition of AGEs forma-
tion [40]. Therefore, compound 1 may be more active than
coumarins with other substituents.
SinceA. iwayomogi is foundmainly inKorea, we collected
15 samples of A. iwayomogi in different regions. The follow-
ing compounds were analyzed by HPLC-PAD from these
fifteen specimens: scopoletin (1), scopolin (2), patulein-3-O-
glucoside (8), quercetin-3-gentiobioside (10), rutin (11), 3-
O-caffeoylquinic acid (12), 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (14),
and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (15). They all showed sig-
nificant inhibition of either AR or AGEs formation. Overall,
the most abundant bioactive compounds were harvested in
Yangyang, Gangwon-do, from June (Figure 3). We demon-
strated that A. iwayomogi, which was harvested in Yangyang,
Gangwon-do, from June, was the best used formedicinal food
such as diabetic complications.
5. Conclusion
In summary, our study reported the isolation of two
coumarins (1 and 2), nine flavonoids (3–11), five caf-
feoylquinic acids (12–16), three diterpene glycosides (17–19),
and one phenolic compound (20). Among them, hispidulin
(4), 6-methoxytricin (6), arteanoflavone (7), quercetin-3-
gentiobioside (10), 1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (13), and
suavioside A (18) were isolated for the first time from A.
iwayomogi. In addition, two coumarins, nine flavonoids,
and five caffeoylquinic acids isolated from A. iwayomogi
demonstrated biological activities against AR and AGEs
formation. Since extracts of A. iwayomogi contained enough
amounts of active compounds, A. iwayomogi extract can be
used for the successful crude herbal drug against AR and
AGEs formation. BecauseA. iwayomogi is native to Korea, we
analyzed the bioactive compounds by region.We determined
that it is best to harvestA. iwayomogi in Yangyang, Gangwon-
do, from June in order to get the highest content of active
compounds. Based on these, our research demonstrates
that A. iwayomogi containing active compounds is clearly a
potential candidate for a new natural alternative medicine or
health supplement and a preventive or therapeutic agent in
the treatment of diabetic complications.
