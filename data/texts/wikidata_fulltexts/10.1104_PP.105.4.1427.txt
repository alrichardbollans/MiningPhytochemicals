Cells Kenji Otani, Takeyoshi Takahashi, Tsutomu Furuya, and Shin-ichi Ayabe* Department of Applied Biological Science, College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252, Japan (K.O., T.T., S.A.); and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108, Japan (T.F.) Cultured Glycyrrhiza echinata L. (Leguminosae) cells produce a retrochalcone echinatin (4,4’-dihydroxy-2-methoxychalcone) and its biosynthetic intermediate licodione [1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3- (4-hydroxyphenyl)-l,3-propanedione, a dibenzoylmethane (keto form) or i t s  enol tautomer (/3-hydroxychalcone)], when treated with elicitor-active substances, e.g. yeast extract. A microsomal fraction (160,OOOg pellet) prepared from yeast extract-induced suspension cultures of G. echinata catalyzed the formation of licodione from (2s)-liquiritigenin (7,4’-dihydroxyflavanone) in the presence of NADPH and air. This licodione synthase activity was shown to be dependent on cytochrome P450 by i t s  microsomal localization, requirement of NAD(P)H and 0 2  for activity, and inhibition by typical cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Licodione synthase activity transiently increased in the cells after treatment with yeast extract. When (2S)-naringenin (5,7,4‘-trihydroxyflavanone) and NADPH were incubated with the same microsomal preparation, a polar compound, which further converted into apigenin (5,7,4’-trihy- droxyflavone) when treated with acid, was produced. The reaction mechanism of licodione synthase i s  likely to be 2-hydroxylation of the flavanone molecule and subsequent hemiacetal opening and i s  possibly the same as the previously suggested mechanism of fla- vone synthase II from soybean and, furthermore, closely related to isoflavone synthase from heraria lobata. strated in these induced cells (Ayabe et al., 1988a). Subse- quently, this activity was shown to consist of conventional CHS and a new reductase in elicitor-challenged soybean cells (Welle and Grisebach, 1988). Recently, in G. echinata cells, too, the involvement of the reductase in deoxychalcone for- mation was demonstrated (HaranÔ et al., 1993). In isoflavo- noid biosynthesis, the chalcone product isomerizes to a fla- vanone, which undergoes an oxidative aryl migration to give an isoflavone. IFS has been characterized in soybean (Kochs and Grisebach, 1986) and Pueraria lobata (Hakamatsuka et al., 1990) cell cultures. The retrochalcone branch should originate at the same 6’-deoxychalcone/5-deoxyflavanone stage, but the enzymic nature of this transformation has not yet been clarified. In this paper we describe the activity of LS found in the microsomal fraction of G. echinata cells treated with YE. A possible relationship between LS, FS, and IFS is discussed. LS proved to be one of multiple plant Cyt P450s (Donaldson and Luster, 1991) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, and its role in symbiotic plant-microbe interactions can also be hypothesized. Characteristic phytoalexins of Leguminosae belong to the 5-deoxyisoflavonoid class, and elicitor treatment of legumi- nous cells often results in a rapid induction of enzymes of both the general phenylpropanoid and flavonoid/isoflavo- noid pathways (Ebel, 1986; Smith and Banks, 1986). In Glycyrrhiza echinata L. (Leguminosae) cells, however, treat- ment with YE and other elicitor-active substances causes rapid and transient accumulation of a retrochalcone (echin- atin) and its biosynthetic intermediate (licodione; a diben- zoylmethane or a /3-hydroxychalcone), whereas an isoflavone (formononetin) is a constitutive component of regular (non- induced) cells (Fig. 1; Ayabe et al., 1986). Induction of the activities of the enzymes involved in retrochalcone synthesis in YE-treated cells has been demonstrated (Ayabe et al., 1987, and refs. cited therein). The activity of 6’-deoxychalcone synthase, the crucial en- zyme of 5-deoxy(iso)flavonoid pathway, was first demon- * Corresponding author; fax 81-466-80-1141.

DOCS, 6'-Deoxychalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase. Cell Cultures and lnduction Methods G. echinata suspension cultures were started by the inocu- lation of callus cells (3 weeks old) into liquid media, and after 2 weeks a portion of the culture was diluted with 4 volumes of freshly prepared medium. The second passage of the culture was grown for 7 to 10 d and used for the induction experiments. Murashige-Skoog medium was used throughout supplemented with 1 pg mL-' IAA and 0.1 pg mL-' kinetin with (for callus) or without (for suspension cultures) 0.9% (w/v) agar, and the cultures were maintained in the dark at 25OC. Treatment with 0.1% (w/v per medium) YE (Difco, Detroit, MI) was as described by Ayabe et al. (1986). Enzymic Synthesis of (2S)-['4C]Liquiritigenin and (2S)-['4C]Naringenin Crude enzyme (10,OOOg supematant) was prepared from YE-induced (approximately 12 h) G. echinata-cultured cells as described by Ayabe et al. (1988a). The 6'-deoxychalcone synthase reaction (coupled with chalcone isomerase reaction) was also camed out essentially by the same method (Ayabe et al., 1988a) but on a larger scale. Normally 120 nmol of 4- coumaroyl-COA and 23.4 nmol of [2-'4C]malonyl-CoA (44 kBq) were incubated with 5 mL of crude enzyme (approxi- mately 5 mg of protein) in the presence of 0.5 m NADPH. The EtOAc extracts of the reaction mixture were subjected to preparative TLC on silica gel (developed twice with tol- uene:EtOAc [3:2, v/v]). The radioactive products were visu- alized by autoradiography, and radioactive liquiritigenin bands (Rp 0.37) were separated and eluted with EtOAc. For the synthesis of (2s)-naringenin, the same procedure was used except for the omission of NADPH from the reaction mixture, and the radioactive band at R F  0.50 on silica gel TLC was collected. The radioactive yield was about 10% for both products, and the specific activity of these products was 5.6 kBq/nmol. A11 pirocedures were camed out at O to 4OC. The cells harvested were ground in a mortar with the same volume (per weight) of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 14 m 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% (w/v) Suc (grinding buffer), one-tenth weight of Polyclar AT, and one- half weight of sea sand. The homogenate was filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged (10,OOOg for 10 min). The supematant was treated with Dowex :,-X2 (equili- brated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.51) for 20 min, followed by filtration through a glass filter. The filtrate Twas centrifuged at 25,OOOg for 20 min, and the re- sulting supematant was finally ultracentrifuged at 160,OOOg for 90 min. The precipitates formed were suspended in appropriate volumes of the grinding buffer and used as the enzyme preparation. CO-difference spectra were recorded after bubbling a gentle stream of CO (20 s) into a cuvette containing 3 mL of enzyme preparation (300-400 pg mL-' protein) that had been mixed vvith approximately 2 mg of solid Na2S204. For solu- bilization of the enzyme preparation, 3-[(3-chlAamidopro- py1)dimethylammoniol-1-propanesulfonate (15 m) and EDTA (1 mM) were added to the microsomal suspension, and after sonication (three times for 30 s at 5-min intervals), the mixture was ultracentrifuged at 100,OOOg for 60 min. The supema tant solution was used for the measurernent of CO- difference spectra as described above. Enzyme Reactions The reaction mixture contained (2S)-['4C]liquiritigenin (670-1670 Bq) in 2-methoxyethanol (30 pL), 1 InM NADPH (20 pL), and 1 mL of crude enzyme (800-1200 pg mL-' protein)~ in a total volume of 1.05 mL. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH. After the inixture was incubabed at 25OC for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by the adclition of 20 pL of acetic acid. Standard samples of liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, and licodione were further added i is  camers to the mixture, which was subsequently extracted with EtOAc (2 mL). An aliquot of the EtOAc extract was concentrated and analyzed with a TLC-linear analyzer (Bertho'ld, LB2820-1). TLC solvents wei'e toluene: Et0Ac:methanol:light petroleum (6:4: 1:3, v/v) for silica gel and 30% (v/v) acetic acid for cellulose. For quantitative measunement of enzyme activity (e.g. for inhibctor studies), the radnoactive products were separated from the TLC, and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Protein content was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). (2S)-['4C]Naringenin (600 Bq) and NADPH (1 m) were also incubated with the enzyme preparation by the same method, and without the addition of carrier flavonoids, the concenlrated EtOAc extract was subjected to cdlulose TLC (solvent, ch1oroform:acetic acid:H20, 10:9:1). Thi? radioactive spot wiis scraped from the plate, eluted with miithanol, and concentated. The residual material was dissolvctd in 0.8 mL of ethanol and stirred at room temperature fox 2 h with 2 drops of 12 N HC1, after which the EtOAc layer vtas prepared and analyzed with a TLC-linear analyzer as described above.  www.plantphysiol.orgon May 13, 2019 - Published by Downloaded from Copyright © 1994 American Society of Plant Biologists.

RESULTS The reaction products formed from (2S)-[’4C]liquiritigenin when it was incubated with the microsomal fraction of G. echinata cells that had been treated with YE were analyzed by cellulose TLC. Although general separation of flavonoids by silica gel TLC was much better than that with cellulose TLC, discrimination of licodione and isoliquiritigenin, which was the expected product from liquiritigenin from the reac- tion of chalcone isomerase (reverse reaction; Fig. I), was very difficult with this adsorbent (Kirikae et al., 1993). Reverse- phase HPLC with the gradient solvent system, which is commonly used for flavonoid analysis (Koster et al., 1983), was also inadequate in the analysis of dibenzoylmethane compounds because of extreme broadening of the peak due to the presence of keto-enol tautomeric structures (Ayabe and Furuya, 1980; Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows typical radiochro- matograms, in which radioactivity at the RF of licodione is clearly seen in the lane loaded with the products from the reaction involving NADPH (Fig. 2A). Additional radioactive materials have occasionally been detected, but the identity of these compounds has yet to be determined. The localization of the activity in the 160,OOOg pellet (microsomes) but not in the supernatant and requirement of NADPH for activity were also demonstrated (Fig. 2, B and C). The material extracted from the licodione spot from cellu- lose TLC was mixed with a sample of nonradioactive lico- dione and repeatedly recrystallized. As shown in Table I, the specific radioactivity in samples from successive recrystalli- zations is constant, confirming the identity of the radioactive product with licodione. Thus, the detected enzyme activity can be designated LS. The apparent mode of action of LS is to introduce one atom of oxygen into the substrate. Table I1 shows the effects of substitution of NADPH by NADH and also deletion of O2 from the reaction by replace- ment with N2 and using an 02-consuming system. The re- action was shown to require molecular O2 and NADPH, although NADH also served as the hydride donor less effec- tively. The microsomal localization of the activity and these co-factor requirements strongly suggested that the activity is attributable to a Cyt P450. The effects of known typical inhibitors of Cyt P450s were then tested (Table 111). As expected, they inhibited licodione formation substantially. The microsomal suspension and a solubilized microsome actually showed an absorption at 450 nm (Fig. 3) when CO gas was bubbled after reduction with sodium dithionite (Omura and Sato, 1964). This confirmed the existence of Cyt P450 species in the preparations, with about 20 and 60 pmol mg-’ protein of Cyt P450s estimated to be in the 160,OOOg pellet and solubilized microsomes, respectively. The activity change of LS in the microsome preparation of G. echinata cells after the addition of YE is shown in Figure 4. There was weak constitutive activity, and on elicitation, the activity rapidly increased to the highest value at 18 h and gradually declined by 24 h. This time course of activity changes was similar to the changes reported for echinatin and licodione levels (maximum, 16-24 h; Ayabe et al., 1986, 1987; A. Udagawa and S. Ayabe, unpublished results) and Table 1. Dilution analysis of [’4C]/icodione The licodione spot separated from the cellulose TLC plate loaded with the EtOAc extract of a standard LS reaction mixture was eluted with methanol and diluted with 35.4 mg of cold licodione sample. This was repeatedly recrystallized from ethanol/H20, and the radio- activity in weighed portions of the crystals at each stage was measured with a liauid scintillation counter.

Representative data from two independent experiments are shown. The 02-consuming system consisted of 50 m M  Clc, 5 units of Glc oxidase, and 10 units of catalase. After the microsomal suspension containing (5)-[''C]liquiritigenin and the Oz-consuming system were preincubated for the time indicated, NADPH was added to start the reaction. The enzyme activity of the complete system (100%) was 0.53 pmol h-' g-' fresh weight.

When (2S)-[14C]naringenin instead of (2S)-[14C]liquiriti- genin was incubated with the same microsomal preparation and NADPH (1 mM), a polar radioactive substance emerged as a major product (Fig. 5A), the RF value of which on cellulose TLC (0.36) was approximately identical with the reported RF value (0.41) of 2-hydroxynaringenin (Britsch, 1990). This product further converted into a compound co- migrating with apigenin when treated with acid (Fig. 5B). DISCUSSION The reaction catalyzed by LS is demonstrated to be de- pendent on a Cyt P450, which is induced in YE-treated cells coordinately with CHS, the reductase yielding 6'-deoxychal- cone (HaranÔ et al., 1993), and a methyltransferase involved in retrochalcone synthesis (Fig. 4). A plausible mechanism of Table 111. Effects of Cyt P450 inhibitors on LS activity The assay was carried out with microsomes prepared as de- scribed in Table II. The reaction mixture contained appropriate volumes (30 or 35 pL) of the inhibitor solutions (solvent, 2-meth- oxyethanol), and the activity was compared to that of t h e  control containing the same volumes of the solvent.

CO-difference spectra of sodium dithionite-reduced mi- crosome (A) and solubilized microsome (B) prepared from YE- induced (18 h)  C. echinata cells. LS reaction is the direct hydroxylation of C-2 of liquiritigenin to yield 2-hydroxyliquiritigenin, which undergoes hemiacetal opening to give licodione (keto form, Fig. 6). The tautomeric structures of licodione have been examined by 'H- and I3C- NMR (Ayabe and Furuya, 1980). Licodione exists in major enol (about 70%) and minor keto (about 30%) forms (both chain tautomers) but not in a hemiacetal form ring tauto- mer). Thus, the direct product of the enzymic hjdroxylation would spontaneously convert into chain tautomers. Cyt 1'450-dependent 2-hydroxylation of flavanone has been postulated in the enzymic conversion o1 naringenin (5-hydr~oxyflavanone) into apigenin (5-hydroxyjlavone) cat- alyzed by FS I1 in soybean cells (Kochs and Grisebach, 1987).

This reaction mechanism is in sharp con- trast to that of FS I from parsley in which a 2-oxoglutarate- dependent desaturase reaction has been demonstrated (Britsch, 1990). FS I1 activity is induced in soybean cells in response to osmotic stress, whereas IFS is induced by elicitor (Kochs et al., 1987). Whether FS I1 can utilize 5-deoxyflava- none (liquiritigenin) as a substrate (and whether 7,4'-dihy- droxyflavone is produced) is not reported, but if it does, the former half reaction is the same as the LS reaction. When G. echinata microsome was tested with ['*C]naringenin as a substrate, a compound that is most likely to be 2-hydroxy- naringenin was formed (Fig. 5), further supporting the iden- tities of LS and FS 11. Another Cyt P450 enzyme closely related to LS in view of the reaction mechanism is IFS (Fig. 6) .  Among several pro- posed mechanisms of IFS, the reaction pathway composed of two parts (Hashim et al., 1990) seems to be reasonable. In the first reaction, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone is produced by a Cyt P450-dependent hydroxylation accompanied by aryl migration; then, in the second reaction, a dehydratase cata- lyzes 2,3-dehydration to yield an isoflavone (daidzein). 2- Hydroxyisoflavanone (5-deoxy type) was detected (by NMR) in the reaction of liquiritigenin with washed microsomes from P. lobata cells. Also, the synthesis of genistein (5-hydroxyi- soflavone) from naringenin (5-hydroxyflavanone) by the en- zyme from soybean cells has been reported to involve 2- hydroxyisoflavanone (5-hydroxy type) as a possible inter- mediate (Kochs and Grisebach, 1986), although the origin of the oxygen atom of the 2-hydroxyl group is supposed to be water. Therefore, LS, FS 11, and IFS are a11 likely to be Cyt P450 hydroxylases acting on a flavanone skeleton at C-2, and the former two are possibly the same activity. IFS would have the additional catalytic activity of aryl migration. Licodione and its prenyl derivatives have been found from Glycyrrhiza sp. (Ayabe et al., 1980, 1986; Demizu et al., 1992; Zeng et al., 1992) and from alfalfa (Kobayashi et al., 1988), in which elicitor-induced synthesis of licodione from a remote precursor, Phe, was recently demonstrated (Kirikae et al., 1993). In view of its biosynthetic relationship to commonly found 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone, the distribution of licodione could be even wider than already reported. Recently, several reports have appeared concerning the cloning of Cyt P450 genes involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosyn- thesis in higher plants (Fahrendorf and Dixon, 1993; Holton et al., 1993; Mizutani et al., 1993; Teutsch et al., 1993). Among these, a cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase gene was iden- tified in the cDNA library of alfalfa (Fahrendorf and Dixon, 1993), in which IFS activity has also been demonstrated (Kessmann et al., 1990). Thus, the cloning of IFS and LS constructing a cDNA library from poly(A)+ RNA of YE- induced G. echinata cells, and cloning of Cyt P450s is expected in addition to the reductase co-acting with CHS to yield 6'-  deoxychalcone (T. Furuno, T. Akashi, T. Takahashi, and S. Ayabe, unpublished data). Transcriptional activation of nod genes in (Brady)Rhizobium by leguminous flavonoids is of interest, especially from the viewpoint of symbiotic (establishing N2-fixing root nodules) and pathogenic (inducing defense responses in host cells) interactions between plants and microorganisms (Kape et al., 1992; Dakora et al., 1993). The LS (or FS 11) activity produces potent nod-inducer flavones, e.g. 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone and luteolin (Peters et al., 1986; Redmond et al., 1986; Maxwell et al., 1989), whereas IFS is involved in the synthesis of phytoalexins, which play a role in pathogenic interactions (although some 5-deoxyisoflavones have also been found to have nod-inducing activity: Kosslak et al., 1987). Biosynthetic branching into the most active nod-inducer methoxychalcone of alfalfa (Maxwell et al., 1989) also takes place at the 6'- deoxychalcone stage (Maxwell et al., 1992). Hence, the con- Figure 6. Proposed mechanisms of LS, FS II, and IFS.
