INTRODUCTION
Prangos uloptera DC. (family: Apiaceae alt.
Umbelliferae) is an endemic Iranian species of the 
genus Prangos that comprises ca. 30 species of 
perennial herbs, distributed in the Mediterranean region, 
Caucasia, Central Asia, Turkey, Iraq and Iran (Evans, 
1989; Mazloomifar et al., 2004; GRIN Databases, 
2008). Prangos species, commonly known as ‘Djashir’ 
in Iran, are widely used in folk medicine as tonic, and for 
the treatment of fl atulence, haemorrhoids, wounds and 
leukoplakia (Dokonic et al., 2004; Yasuhiro et al., 2001). 
Previous phytochemical investigations on the fruits and 
roots of P. uloptera revealed the presence of various 
coumarins, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (Abyshev 
and Denisenko, 1970, 1973; Sefi dkon and Navaii, 2001; 
Mazloomifar et al., 2004). The essential oils obtained 
from the umbels of this species have recently been shown 
to contain various terpenoidal compounds (Nazemieyh 
et al., 2007). As part of our on-going phytochemical and 
bioactivity studies on Iranian medicinal plants, we now 
report on the isolation, identifi cation and antioxidant 
properties of fi ve coumarins from the aerial parts of P. 
uloptera.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
General procedures
UV spectra were obtained in MeOH using a 
Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-Vis spectrometer (Agilent, 
Germany). Optical rotations were measured on a 
Bellingham Stanley ADP220 polarimeter. CIMS 
(Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry) analyses 
were performed in EPSRC Central Mass Spectroscopy 
Facility in Swansea, UK, on a Micromass Quattro II 
triple quadrupole instrument (Waters, UK) in chemical 
desorption mode using ammonia as CI gas. Mass 
accuracy was within 0.4 Da. CI source temperature was 
170 oC and electron energy was 59 eV. NMR spectra 
were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian Unity INOVA 
400 MHz NMR Spectrometer 400 (400 MHz for 1H

and 100 MHz for 13C) using the residual solvent peaks 
as internal standard. Chemical shifts ??  were in ppm. 
The HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence) 
experiment used J = 9 Hz and had a 55 ms long-range 
coupling delay. A NOESY experiment was carried out 
with a mixing time of 0.8 s. Spectra were recorded 
with a probe temperature of 25 °C. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-
picrylhydrazyl (molecular formula C18H12N5O6, DPPH) 
and trolox were purchased from Fluka (UK) and were 
used without further purifi cation. Precoated aluminium 
sheets silica gel 60 F254 (0.25 mm thickness) TLC plates 
(Merck, Germany) were used. TLC mobile phases were 
n-hexane-ethylacetate (EtOAc) mixtures of various 
proportions, e.g. 5% EtOAc in n-hexane, 10% EtOAc 
in n-hexane, etc. Silica 60G was used for vacuum liquid 
chromatography (VLC).
Plant material
The aerial parts of Prangos uloptera DC., were 
collected in May 2005, from Mishov-Dagh mountain 
(altitude 2056 m) in the northwest of Iran. A Voucher 
specimen (No. 1384-1) was deposited in the herbarium 
of the Department of Plant Sciences, Faculty of Natural 
Sciences, Tabriz University, Iran, and also in the 
herbarium of the Plant and Soil Science Department, 
University of Aberdeen, Scotland (ABD).
Preparation of plant extracts
The dried and ground aerial parts of P. uloptera
(270 g) were Soxhlet-extracted, successively, with 
n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol (0.7 L each). 
The extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporator at 
45 oC. 
Isolation and identifi cation of compounds
The n-hexane extract (2 g) was subjected to 
vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) on silica gel, 
eluting with solvent mixtures of increasing polarity: 
100% n-hexane, n-hexane-EtOAc, 100% EtOAc and 
100% MeOH, to yield a number of fractions which 
upon initial thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analyses 
were grouped into 16 main fractions. Fractions 14-16 
(80-100% EtOAc in n-hexane and 100% MeOH) 
were further analysed by preparative TLC (mobile 
phase acetone:CHCl3 = 5:95) to afford fi ve coumarins, 
xanthotoxin (1, 10.1 mg, Rf = 0.5), prangenin (heraclenin, 
2, 9.3 mg, Rf = 0.55), 6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin 
(scopoletin, 3, 13.0 mg, Rf = 0.43), marmesin angelate 
(deltoin, 4, Rf = 0.64, 10.2 mg) and marmesin isovalerate 
(oxypeucedanin or prangolarin, 5, 9.2 mg, Rf = 0.60). 
The structures of the isolated compounds 1-5 were 
elucidated by direct comparison of their UV, specifi c 
rotation (where applicable), ESIMS, 1H and 13C NMR 
data with published data, and by comprehensive 1D and 
2D NMR analyses.
Antioxidant assay
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 
molecular formula C18H12N5O6, was obtained from 
Fluka Chemie AG, Bucks. Trolox® (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-
tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) was obtained 
from Sigma-Aldrich, UK (http://www.sigmaaldrich.
com/Area_of_Interest/Europe_Home/UK.html). The 
method used by Takao et al. (1994) was adopted with 
suitable modifi cations (Kumarasamy et al., 2007). DPPH 
(8 mg) was dissolved in MeOH (100 mL) to obtain a 
concentration of 80 ?g/mL.
Qualitative Analysis: Test samples were applied 
on a Silica gel TLC plate and sprayed with DPPH 
solution using an atomiser. It was allowed to develop 
for 30 min. The colour changes (purple on white) were 
noted.
Quantitative Analysis: Serial dilutions were 
carried out with the stock solutions (1 mg/mL) of the 
compounds (1-5) to obtain concentrations of 5 x 10-1, 5 
x 10-2, 5 x 10-3, 5 x 10-4, 5 x 10-5, 5 x 10-6 mg/mL. Diluted 
solutions (2 mL each) were mixed with DPPH (2 mL) 
and allowed to stand for 30 min for any reaction to 
occur. The UV absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. The

experiment was performed in duplicate and the average 
absorption was noted for each concentration. The 
same procedure was followed for the positive control 
Trolox®. The RC50 value, which is the concentration 
of the test material that reduces 50% of the free radical 
concentration, was calculated as mg/mL.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chromatographic analyses of the n-hexane 
extract of the aerial parts of P. uloptera afforded two 
furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin (1, Masuda et al., 
1998) and prangenin (2, Miftakhova et al., 2001), 
two dihydrofuranocoumarins, deltoin (4, Baba et al., 
1989) and prangolarin (5, Kapoor et al., 1972; Wei 
and Ito, 2006), and a simple coumarin, scopoletin (3,
SDBS Database, 2008). The structures of the isolated 
coumarins (1-5) were elucidated by direct comparison of

their respective UV, specifi c rotation (where applicable), 
CIMS, 1H and 13C NMR data with published data, and 
by comprehensive 1D and 2D NMR analyses. The 
unambiguous assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR signals 
for these compounds has been presented in  Tables 1 
and 2.  
Although coumarins have previously been 
reported from the roots and fruits of P. uloptera, to our 
knowledge, this is the fi rst report on the occurrence 
of coumarins in the aerial parts of this plant. Also, 
except xanthotoxin (1) and prangenin (2), none of these 
coumarins (3-5) have ever been reported from this 
plant. Xanthotoxin (1) and scopoletin (3) occur in many 
genera of the family Apiaceae as well as other families, 
e.g. Rutaceae. The genus Prangos is well-known for 
producing simple and furanocoumarins with various 
degrees of oxygenation and prenylations (ISI Database, 
2008). Within the genus Prangos, prangenin (2) occurs 
in a number of species, including P. equisetoides 
(Kuznetsova et al., 1979), P. fedtschenkoii, P. ferulaceae,
P. hissarica (Combined Chemical Dictionary, 2008; ISI 
Database, 2008), P. lamellate (Donchul et al., 1979), 
P. pabularia (Sood et al., 1978; Tada et al., 2002), 
P. sarawschanica (Combined Chemical Dictionary, 
2008) and P. uloptera (Abyshev and Denisenko, 1973). 
However, apart from the genus Prangos, prangenin 
(2) has also been reported from a few other genera, 
e.g. Atalantia, Chlamydomonas, Citrus, Eriostemon,
Halocnemum, Heracleum, Phebalium and Stauranthus,
(ISI Database, 2008; Combined Chemical Dictionary, 
2008). The occurrence of deltoin (4) within the genus 
Prangos is rather restricted mainly to P. uloptera and
P. fedtschenkoi, but it has been isolated from a few 
other genera, e.g. Peucedanum, Saposhnikovia, Seseli 
and Zosima. Marmesin isovalerate (prangolarin or 
oxypeucedanin, 5) occurs widely in the family Apiaceae, 
and also in the genera Atalantia, Citrus and Poncirus of 
the family Rutaceae (Combined Chemical Dictionary, 
2008). 
The antioxidant potential of 1-5 was evaluated 
by the DPPH assay (Kumarasamy et al., 2007). In 
the qualitative DPPH assay, except 3, all compounds 
showed extremely low levels of antioxidant activity by 
displaying faint white spots against a purple background 
on the TLC plates. In the quantitative DPPH assay, 
scopoletin (3) was the most active among all compounds, 
and displayed a signifi cant antioxidant activity with a 
RC50 value of 2.43 x 10
-2 (Table 3).
