Summary Eupatoriopicrin (EUP), a sesquiterpene lactone from Eupatorium cannabinum L., possesses
cytostatic activity. This was demonstrated for FIO 26 cells in vitro with the aid of a clonogenic assay and in
vivo by tumour growth delay in FIG26 and Lewis lung tumour-bearing mice. In vitro the IC50 for h
exposure to EUP was 1.5 5igml- 1 (4.1 nmol ml-1). This concentration depleted about 25% of its cellular GSH
concentration. Pretreatment of FIO26 cells with BSO, resulting in > 99%. GSH depletion, enhanced the
cytotoxic effect of EUP. The dose-enhancement factor at the level of 10% cell survival was 2.3. Growth
inhibition of the Lewis lung carcinoma and the FIG26 fibrosarcoma, solidly growing in C57B1 mice, was
found after i.v. injection of 20 or 40mgkg-1 EUP, at a tumour volume of about 500pl. Pretreatment with
BSO at a dose of 4 mmolkg i.p., 6 h before EUP administration, resulted in a significantly stronger growth
delay of both tumours compared with EUP only. At the time of EUP treatment, cellular GSH in the tumours
was reduced by BSO treatment to about 60%. It is concluded that EUP possesses antitumour activity in vivo
and that chemosensitisation of EUP may be accomplished by pretreatment with BSO, indicating that
endogenous GSH protects against the cytostatic action of EUP.
Plants are sources of interest in the search for novel
antitumour agents. Reports in the literature suggest that
substances in Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Asteraceae) possess
such activity, although no systematic study on this subject is
available as yet. This plant is native in most parts of Europe
and contains several different sesquiterpene lactones.
Eupatoriopicrin (EUP; Figure 1), a germacranolide, may be
present up to 0.4% in the dried plant material (Rodriguez et
al., 1976; Woerdenbag, 1986).
Several studies have been performed with EUP using
cultured cells (HIadof et al., 1975a,b; Woerdenbag et al.,
1986). One other report deals with four sesquiterpene
lactones (Arrick et al., 1983), not including EUP. Inhibition
of tumour cell growth and cell lysis were the criteria of
effectivity used in these investigations. No research is known
on clonogenic ability of tumour cells after exposure to
sesquiterpene lactones.
Reports on in vivo testing of EUP are extremely scarce. In
this respect only one study is known, where it is mentioned
that death of tumour bearing mice was delayed after
administration of EUP (Hladon & Chodera, 1975). Apart
from this there are two preliminary reports from our own
laboratories concerned with tumour growth delay studies
after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of EUP, using
tumour bearing mice (Woerdenbag et al., 1987a, b).
Sesquiterpene lactones possessing an a-methylene y-lactone
functionality (EUP: see Figure 1) are electrophilic agents and
thus apt to react with biological nucleophiles, such as the
sulphydryl group of glutathione (GSH) (Picman et al., 1979),
proteins and parts of DNA. In vitro high reactivity of some
sesquiterpene lactones towards GSH in aqueous buffer has
been described by Arrick et al. (1983). Reduction of cellular
GSH levels in vitro has been reported for tumour cells
exposed to sesquiterpene lactones (Arrick et al., 1983). In
vivo a decrease of GSH levels in liver and tumour tissue of
the mouse, after i.p. and intravenous (i.v.) administration,
has been described by us (Woerdenbag et al., 1988b).
It is of interest to explore further the potential of
sesquiterpene lactones as antitumour agents in animal
models. In the current study investigations are described on
the effect of EUP on tumour cells grown in vitro using a
clonogenic assay, and in vivo after i.v. injection, on two
murine tumour models (Lewis lung carcinoma and FIG26
fibrosarcoma) by measuring tumour growth. Because EUP

affected the cellular GSH content (Woerdenbag et al.,
1988b), it was decided to investigate whether chemo-
sensitisation of EUP might take place in vitro and in vivo
after depleting tumour cells and tissue of GSH by buthionine
sulphoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis,
by reacting with y-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Griffith &
Meister, 1979a).
Materials and methods
Chemicals
EUP (MA= 362) was isolated from ground dried aerial parts
of Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Woerdenbag, 1986). The
identity and purity were confirmed using spectroscopical and
chromatographic techniques (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C_NMR MS,
TLC, HPLC). D(L-buthionine-S,R-sulphoximine (BSO) was
purchased from Chemalog (South Plainfield, USA). Oxidised
glutathione (GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR) and 5,5'-
dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent)
were from Sigma (St Louis, USA). NADPH was from
Boehringer (Mannheim, FR Germany). Folin-Ciocalteus
reagent was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, FR
Germany).
In vitro study
Cells of the FIO 26 tumour were grown in suspension culture
in RPMI 1640 (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Paisley,
Scotland), plus 50 ,ugml -1 streptomycin and 50 IUml-1
penicillinG. The doubling time was 17-21 h. All
experiments were performed with exponentially growing
cells.
To investigate the influence of EUP on the cellular GSH
level, 10ml of a cell suspension, containing about 1 x 106
Br. J. Cancer (1989), 59, 68-75 C The Macmillan Press Ltd., 1989CYTOSTATIC ACTIVITY OF EUPATORIOPICRIN 69
viable cells per ml, were incubated in 25 ml stoppered
siliconated Erlenmeyer flasks in a gently shaking water bath
at 37°C. The cells were allowed to habituate to the
conditions for I h. A solution of EUP in ethanol 96% (v/v)
was added, at plml-I cell suspension, yielding final EUP
concentrations of 0.1, 1, 5, 10 and 50Mugml-1. Ethanol was
used as the control.
For biochemical assays, samples of 1 ml cell suspension
were taken after incubation times of 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90
and 120 min. The cells were washed twice with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS: 1.6 mM KH2PO4, 6.5 mM
Na2HPO4. 12H20, 0.137M NaCl, 2.7mM KCl, pH7.4) by
centrifugation' (5min, 160g), resuspended in 1.2ml of
distilled water and vortexed. The samples were stored at
-20°C until analysed for GSH and protein content.
To obtain a quantitative dose-survival relation, the clono-
genic ability of single cells was determined with and without
pretreatment with BSO. To achieve GSH depletion >99%,
cells were cultured for 20 h in the growth medium,
supplemented with 500 4uM BSO, preceding the incubation
with EUP. This BSO treatment had no deleterious effect on
cell viability nor on plating efficiency. A total of 1 x 106
viable cells were incubated with different concentrations of
EUP, during I h in a gently shaking water bath at 37°C.
Subsequently, the cells were washed with RPMI 1640.
Samples of cell suspension were diluted to obtain about 100
colonies per plate and mixed with 1 x 105 feeder cells. The
feeder cells were FIG26 cells supralethally irradiated with
100Gy of X-rays before use (Philips Muller MG 300 X-ray
machine). The cells, in a volume of 0.1 ml, were plated in
Petri dishes of 60mm (Greiner, Niirtingen, FR Germany),
containing 0.5% agar (Difco, Detroit, USA) in RPMI 1640,
supplemented with 15% new born calf serum (Gibco,
Paisley, Scotland) plus 50 ugml-1 streptomycin and
50IUml-1 penicillinG. The dishes were incubated at 37°C
in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% CO2 for
about 12 days to obtain countable colonies (> 50 cells). The
plating efficiency of the FIO26 cells lay between 75 and
85%. The viability of the passages used in our experiments
exceeded 95%, as determined with trypan blue exclusion.
The IC50 value (i.e. the drug concentration inhibiting colony
formation by 50%) and the dose-enhancement factor at the
level of 10% cell survival were used as parameters to
compare cytotoxicity.
Mice
Syngeneic C57B1 mice (Department of Radiobiology,
Groningen, The Netherlands), about 3 months old, with a
body weight of 20-25g (female) and 22-27g (male) were
used. Food (Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) and
water were provided ad libitum.
Tumours
The Lewis lung carcinoma was obtained from TNO
(Rijswijk, The Netherlands). The fibrosarcoma FIG26 was
originally a tumour line from BayerAG (Wuppertal, FR
Germany). The Lewis lung carcinoma is a rapidly
metastasising tumour (Mayo, 1972), whereas the FIG 26
fibrosarcoma does not metastasize (Schlumberger, 1981;
Woerdenbag et al., 1987b). Both tumours were maintained
by serial passage in C57B1 mice. The doubling time, Td.
defined as the time necessary for a tumour to double its
volume or weight, was derived from the growth curves, and
was used to characterise tumour growth (Steel, 1977). The
time necessary for a tumour to grow from a volume of
100% to 200% was defined as Td(100%). A tumour volume
of about 500pl corresponded with 100%. Td(100%) was 2.5
and 1.9 days for the Lewis lung and the FIO 26 tumour
respectively.
Tumours were excised from tumour-bearing mice and a
single cell suspension was prepared by a combined
mechanical and enzymatic technique (Woerdenbag et al.,
1987a). A total of 4 x 106 viable cells, in a volume of 0.2ml,
were transplanted subcutaneously in the left flank of the
mice. The Lewis lung carcinoma was transplanted in female
mice (passages 6-13); the fibrosarcoma FIO26 in male mice
(passages 6-10). Tumour growth was recorded by measuring
the three orthogonal diameters of the tumour with a vernier
caliper. Measurements were converted to volume using the
geometrical formula V= 1/6r x length x width x thickness
(Steel, 1977).
Drug treatment of the mice
In the tumour growth delay experiments, drugs were
administered at a tumour volume of 500 + 150Ml, designated
as 'day 0'. The Lewis lung carcinoma attained this volume
about 14 days after transplantation, the FIO 26 after about
13 days. The mice were given 20 or 40mgkg-1 EUP i.v.,
with and without i.p. pretreatment of BSO at a dose of
4mmolkg-1, 6 h before the EUP injection. BSO
4mmolkg-1 i.p. was also administered alone.
In the experiments monitoring the GSH status in liver and
tumour tissue, the mice were treated at a tumour volume
between 500 and 1,000pl. In this range of tumour volumes
no difference was found in GSH content in the control
animals or in the animals treated with EUP.
EUP was dissolved in ethanol 96% (v/v) and diluted with
0.9% NaCl solution, yielding a final ethanol concentration
of 10% (v/v). The injected volume was 0.1 ml per 10 g body
weight (20 mgkg-1 i.v.) or 0.2 ml per lOg body weight
(40mgkg-1 i.v.). All i.v. injections were in the tail vein, and
delivered slowly. BSO was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution
and injected i.p. at 0.15 ml per 10 g body weight. The
solutions were prepared immediately before use. Control
experiments were performed with the vehicle only. No sex-
dependent difference was found in tumour growth or in the
response to the drugs injected.
Preparation of tissue homogenates
All steps to prepare tissue homogenates were carried out at
4°C. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The tumour
and liver were excised and necrotic parts (if any) were
removed from the tumour. Subsequently, the tumour and
liver were washed with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution. The
tissue was minced with scissors and a 10% homogenate in
0.9% NaCl solution was prepared using a Potter-Elvehjem
homogeniser (liver) or a Dounce homogeniser (tumour). The
homogenate was centrifuged (160g, 4°C, 5 min) and the
supernatant was stored at -20°C until assayed for GSH and
protein content (within 1 month).
Biochemical assays
Total gluftathione, referred to as GSH in this paper, was
assayed according to Griffith (1980), with GSSG as the
standard. The thiol concentration was calculated on a
protein basis, assayed by the method of Lowry et al. (1951),
with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Before
performing the latter analysis, the thawed homogenate
samples were sonicated (50W, 30 s).
Statistics
For the statistical evaluation of the data from the in vitro
study, the unpaired Student's t test was used. In the
experiments monitoring tumour growth, statistically
significant differences between the control group and the
treated groups and between the differently treated groups
were calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
of the log-transformed data, followed by the Newman-Keuls
test, according to Snedecor & Cochran (1980). The doubling
times of the tumours were analysed by use of Dunnett's test
for multiple comparisons to a single mean (Dunnett, 1964).
In order to determine a significant difference between the
GSH contents in liver and tumour tissue of the control and
test groups, the data were submitted to the unpaired
Student's t test.70 H.J. WOERDENBAG et al.
Results
In vitro studies
In Figure 2 changes in the GSH status of FIO 26 cells grown
in vitro are presented, following different incubation periods
with a range of EUP concentrations. The GSH level of the
control cells was 19.1 +2.5nmolmg 1 protein (mean+s.d.,
n = 20). A concentration of 1 Mgml- (2.8 nmolml-1) EUP
slightly reduced the cellular GSH level after 1 h incubation.
A clear statistically significant reduction was obtained after
an incubation period of 30-45 min with 5pgml-1
(13.8 nmolml-1). This was followed by a restoration of the
GSH concentration, fully realised after 2 h incubation time.
A persistent significant reduction was caused by a
concentration of 10pgml-l (28 nmolml-1). At a
concentration of 50 pgml- 1 (138 nmolml-1), EUP induced
complete GSH depletion after 30 min incubation and no
recovery was seen within 2 h after the administration of the
drug.
Figure 3 shows the effect of EUP on the clonogenicity of
untreated FIG 26 cells and FIG26 cells, exposed for 20 h to
a BSO concentration of 500 pM. All cells were incubated for
1 h with a range of EUP concentrations. EUP showed
significant cytotoxicity on untreated FIG 26 cells at
concentrations > 1 pgml -1 (2.8 nmolml -1). Treatment of
the cells with BSO resulted in > 99% GSH depletion. EUP-
induced cytotoxicity was enhanced following the GSH
depletion. EUP 0.1 pgml-1 (0.28nmolml-1) significantly
(P < 0.001) reduced the surviving fraction of BSO treated
cells, whereas non-BSO treated cells were not affected. The
IC 5 for 1 h incubation was 1.5jgml-1 (4.1 nmolml-1)
EUP for non-BSO treated cells and 0.26 pgml-1
(0.72 nmolml-1) EUP for BSO treated cells. The IC5
concentration decreased the GSH level by about 25%. At
the level of 10% survival the dose-enhancement factor was
2.3.
Growth of the experimental tumours
In Figures 4 and 5 the growth curves of differently treated
Lewis lung and FIO 26 tumours are given. The
corresponding doubling times are listed in Table I. For the
control groups of both tumours, increasing doubling time
was attended with increasing tumour volume. Administration
of BSO alone (column B) did not affect the tumour growth.
The growth of both tumour types was retarded after i.v.

control group, the Td(100%) increased significantly after
these treatments. No difference in tumour response was
found between 20 and 40 mgkg-1 EUP. As seen from the
Td(100%) and the levels of significance, when the control
and EUP treated groups are compared, the FIO26 fibro-
sarcoma was more sensitive (P < 0.01) for treatment with
EUP than the Lewis lung carcinoma (P< 0.05). Regarding
cumulative tumour volumes, a significant difference
(P < 0.05) with the control group was revealed up to 2 days
after injection for the Lewis lung tumour and up to 8 days
for the FIG 26. The growth delay, caused by EUP, was
temporary only: Td(100%) values differ, but Td(200%) and
Td(300%) of treated and untreated groups were statistically
equal.
In vivo chemosensitisation with BSO
Pretreatment of the animals with 4mmolkg-1 BSO i.p., 6h
before i.v. injection of 20 or 40mgkg-1 EUP, resulted in a
** stronger growth inhibition (Figures 4 and 5, Table I). For
the Lewis lung carcinoma a significant difference (P<0.05)
with the control group persisted up to 5 days after injection
and up to 8 days for the FIO 26. Comparing tumour
volumes of the groups receiving only EUP with those

Statistically significant differences between the differently
treated groups are indicated in the insets in Figures 4 and 5.
To avoid unnecessary suffering from the terminal stage of
cancer, the mice were killed at a tumour volume of about
3,000,pl. All animals lived for at least 10 days after EUP
injection, except FIG 26 bearing mice receiving 4mmolkg-1
BSO and 40mgkg-1 EUP. They died within 48h after the
treatment in about 50% of the cases due to direct toxicity.
The LD5 of EUP injected i.v. was >80 mgkg- . Higher
concentrations could not be injected because of solubility
problems of EUP in non-toxic solvents. Mice receiving a
single dose of 80mgkg-1 EUP i.v., dissolved in 10% (v/v)
ethanol, were killed 3 months after the injection, and
autopsy was carried out. Macroscopically no changes were
seen. Microscopical examination of liver, kidney, lung, heart,
spleen, gut, brain and bone marrow did not reveal any gross
abberation.
GSH reduction in vivo
The GSH levels in the tumours of the control groups were
33.4+5.6nmol per mg protein (mean+s.d., n=19) for the
Lewis lung carcinoma and 54.6 + 5.6 nmolpermg protein
(n = 13) for the FIO 26. The GSH status in the liver of the
tumour bearing animals was respectively 83.6 + 10.9 and
78.2 + 9.9 nmolpermg protein. Liver tissue of normal female
C57B1 mice contained 71.4 + 9.4 nmolpermg protein (n = 9)
and of normal male C57B1 mice 71.1 + 5.3 nmol GSH per mg
protein (n = 7). So the livers especially of the Lewis lung
bearing animals had an enhanced GSH content.
We will first consider the effect of BSO alone on the GSH
level in liver and tumour tissue. Following i.p. injection with
4mmolkg-1 BSO, the GSH level in liver (Figure 6) and
tumour (Figure 7) tissue was reduced. The nadir was reached
after 4-8 h in the liver and after 12 h in both tumours. The
degree of GSH depletion was about 50% in livers of normal
mice and mice bearing the FIO 26 tumour. The liver of the
Lewis lung carcinoma bearing animals was depleted to about
85%. Maximal depletion was 65% for the Lewis lung
tumour and 80% for the FIO 26 fibrosarcoma. A rapid
restoration, 12 h after injection, was seen for normal livers
and livers from FIO 26 bearing mice. The restoration of the
GSH level in the liver of Lewis lung carcinoma bearing mice
was slow and still incomplete after 48 h (P < 0.05 compared
with the control). In both tumour types recovery of the GSH
status started later.
Discussion
Eupatoriopicrin in vitro
The studies reported here extend earlier observations that
sesquiterpene lactones have cytotoxic properties. When the
cytotoxicity is compared with the GSH reduction in FIG 26
cells, after 1 h GSH depletion to EUP, it can be concluded
that significant GSH reduction began to occur with
concentrations >1 pgml-I (2.8 nmolml-1) (Figures 2 and
3). This concentration was significantly cytotoxic and
heralded the beginning of the steep part of the survival curve
(Figure 3). GSH depletion at the IC50value for EUP (1 h
incubation) was about 25%. With 5, gml-1
(13.8 nmolml-1) EUP the surviving fraction was 1-2%,
whereas about 70% of the GSH was still inside the cells
after 1 h exposure to EUP.
Recently Arrick et al. (1983) published a study on four
sesquiterpene lactones (vernolepin, helenalin, elephantopin
and eriofertin). In their experiments lysis from tumour cells,
measured by the release of 51Cr after incubation with the
agents mentioned, was investigated. They showed that
addition of BSO to P815 mastocytoma cells, during or
immediately after 1 h exposure to 10 pgml - I vernolepin,
dramatically increased cytolysis. A 1.5 h delay in addition of
BSO to such cells, which allowed them to resynthesise GSH,
reduced cytolysis. They concluded that recovery of the GSH
synthetic capacity after BSO treatment correlated with the
loss of the synergistic effect of BSO on tumour cell
susceptability to cytolysis of vernolepin.
Although these permeability studies were of a different
nature from our clonogenic assays, the results obtained
strengthen the view that GSH is involved in the cytostatic
action of EUP. The importance for GSH synthesis at the
time of EUP administration was also illustrated in our
experiments, showing increased cytotoxicity of EUP after
exposure of FIO 26 cells to BSO. GSH may serve to detoxify
EUP before the alkylation of target molecules or restore
sulphydryl reactive sites damaged by EUP.
Eupatoriopicrin in vivo
It was of interest to investigate whether the results obtained
from the in vitro work could be extrapolated to the in vivo
situation. For this purpose the effect of EUP on tumour
growth was studied, using the Lewis lung carcinoma and the
FIG26 fibrosarcoma, with and without pretreatment with
BSO. The in vivo studies presented here confirm and extend
our preliminary investigations performed with EUP, injected
i.p. (Woerdenbag et al., 1987a, b). EUP significantly
inhibited tumour growth in Lewis lung and FIG26 bearing
mice. In a previous report (Woerdenbag et al., 1988b) we
showed that EUP caused a dose-dependent reduction of the
GSH content in liver as well as in tumour tissue of C57BI
mice. In these experiments 40 mgkg- 1 EUP, injected i.v.,
caused a decrease of the GSH level in liver and tumour
tissue to about 50% between 8 and 12 h after administration.
Whereas there is a clear change in liver and tumour GSH
levels on increasing the dosages of EUP from 20 to
40 mgkg-1, all dosages had the same effect on the growth

delay of both tumours. The experiments reported here show
that GSH depletion by BSO had no influence on tumour
growth, although the GSH levels in the tumours dropped
below 50% between 8 and 12 h.
Woerdenbag et al. (1987a, b) reported on the effect of two
clinically applied chemotherapeutics, doxorubicin and cyclo-
phosphamide, on the tumour models used. Doxorubicin,
0.2 mg per mouse i.p. (approx. 10mgkg-1), did not
significantly delay the Lewis lung tumour, whereas the
growth of the FIO 26 tumour was delayed up to 2 days after
administration. Cyclophosphamide, 4mg per mouse i.p.
(approx. 200 mgkg -1), strongly inhibited the regrowth of
both tumours, but no recession of the tumours was seen.
A rapid, extensive and reversible GSH depletion by BSO
in murine tissues, including several tumours, has been
described previously in the dosage range of 1-5 mmolkg-1
i.p. (Griffith & Meister, 1979b; Minchinton et al., 1984; Lee
et al., 1987). In these studies hepatic GSH was depleted to
about 20% of the control. The results that we found for
normal liver, a reduction of about 50% of the control
(Figure 6) is much less. This difference may possibly be
explained by the different mouse species used in the different
experiments.
As can be seen from Figures 6 and 7, there was a
difference in sensitivity for BSO 4mmolkg-1 i.p. between
the livers of differently treated mice. The livers of mice
transplanted with the FIG 26 fibrosarcoma were as sensitive
for GSH depletion as livers of healthy C57B1 mice. The
GSH reduction in the liver of Lewis lung carcinoma bearing
mice, however, was more profound and the recovery slower.
The difference observed may possibly be explained by
hepatic metastasis formation in Lewis lung carcinoma
bearing animals (Mayo, 1972).
The GSH levels in the two tumours have not been
previously reported. The values for a number of
transplantable murine tumours, as described in the literature
(Minchinton et al., 1984; Lee et al., 1987), were only 10-35%
of the value for the liver. The GSH content of the liver was
about 71 nmol GSH per mg protein, so 54.6 nmol GSH per
mg protein for the FIO 26 tumours is rather high.
The in vitro grown FIO 26 cells contained 19.1 nmol GSH
per mg protein, which was low compared with the in vivo
grown tumours. This is in contrast with recent work from
Allalunis-Turner et al. (1988), who compared cellular GSH
levels in human and rodent tumour cells, grown both in vivo
and in vitro. They demonstrated that tumour cells grown in
vivo showed a decrease in GSH as compared with the same
cells cultured in vitro.
The basal GSH level and the absolute amount of GSH
remaining at the nadir after BSO treatment was higher in the
FIO 26 tumour than in the Lewis lung carcinoma. The
growth of the FIO 26 tumour was stronger inhibited by
EUP, with as well as without chemosensitisation by BSO. So
it must be concluded that no direct relation exists between
the percentage of GSH depletion in cells and cytostatic
activity when different tumour systems are compared.
Although speculative, an explanation for this phenomenon
may possibly be a difference in levels of GSH-S-transferases
in the Lewis lung tumour as compared with the FIO 26
tumour. The detoxification reaction of electrophilic
compounds with GSH may proceed spontaneously or be
catalyzed by GSH-S-transferases, after which the conjugates
are converted to mercapturic acids and excreted into urine
(Habig et al., 1974). Increased GSH-S-transferase activity
has been correlated with resistance of tumour cells to
nitrogen mustards, a group of alkylating agents (Wang &
Tew, 1985). Other possibilities are differences in drug uptake
and different levels of non-protein thiols, other than GSH
and metallothioneins (Andrews et al., 1987), as determinants
for the ultimate antitumour effect.
It is expected that the therapeutic effect, when using BSO
as a chemosensitiser, can be improved when GSH depletion
is less in normal tissue, as compared with the tumour. Bone
marrow is an example of normal tissue that has been found
to be depleted by BSO to only moderate values (Russo et al.,
1986; Soble & Dorr, 1987). With the dosage regimen used in
our experiments, GSH levels in the tumours were severely
reduced by BSO at the moment of supplying EUP, while the
GSH status of the liver was already recovering. This may
partly explain the therapeutic benefit obtained. When
combining BSO with 40 mgkg-1 EUP in FIO 26 bearing
mice an extensive reduction of the GSH level was found.
The accompanying severe GSH reduction in liver tissue was
probably the cause for the acute toxicity following this
combination. Recently, it has been shown that addition of
BSO with certain sulphydryl-dependent anticancer agents
may enhance acute toxicity in mice (Soble & Dorr, 1987).
The finding that BSO treatment enhanced the action of
EUP places the class of sesquiterpene lactones in the list of
cytostatic agents that can be sensitised because of a reduced
GSH level in tumour cells. BSO appeared to be an effective
chemosensitiser for the anticancer drugs melphalan, cyclo-
phosphamide, cisplatin, bleomycin and doxorubicin.
Reviews on this topic have recently been published (Meister
& Anderson, 1983; Arrick & Nathan, 1984). However,
cytostatics acting independently from GSH (5-fluorouracil,
vincristine), are not potentiated by GSH depletion (Ozols &
Cowan, 1986) and the effect of antineoplastic agents that
require intracellular activation by sulphydryl groups
(neocarzinostatin) is absent after GSH depletion (Russo et
al., 1986).
From the present study it can be concluded that GSH in
tumour tissue plays an important role in the defence
mechanism against the cytostatic action of EUP and thus
may contribute to the maintenance of cellular integrity. GSH
may decrease the cytotoxicity of EUP by facilitating its
metabolism to less active compounds or by detoxification of
EUP-induced free radicals or reactive oxygen intermediates.
Recently, it was shown by us that EUP can elicit lipid
peroxidation in liver and tumour tissue of the mouse. In this
study it was suggested that GSH is important to maintain
membrane integrity, because the EUP-induced oxidative
degeneration of lipids from GSH depleted tissue was more
profound (Woerdenbag et al., in preparation). In a parallel
study, we demonstrated that EUP caused DNA damage in
Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. Also, this type of action was
enhanced in cells depleted of GSH.
Adjuvant therapy with BSO, combined with sesquiterpene
lactones, offers better therapeutic perspectives, especially
because it has recently been found that certain semi-synthetic
derivatives from EUP possessed stronger cytotoxic properties
in vitro than the parent compound (Woerdenbag et al.,
1988a).
