Apolo´nia,Apartado 134, 5301-857 Bragancüa, PortugalSix cultivars (Franquette, Marbot, Mayette, Mellanaise, Lara, and Parisienne) of walnuts (Juglansregia L.) were collected during the 2001 crop, from Bragancüa, Portugal. Chemical composition,including moisture, total oil content, crude protein, ash, carbohydrates, and nutritional value, wasevaluated. Fat was the predominant component, ranging from 62.3 to 66.5%. Total oil was extractedand analyzed for fatty acids, sterols, oxidative stability, and peroxide value. Fatty acids and sterolswere determined by gas-liquid chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector. Eighteenfatty acids were quantified. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and, in particular, linoleic acid werepredominant. â-Sitosterol, ¢5-avenasterol, and campesterol were the major sterols found. Differenceswere observed among the studied cultivars, especially in peroxide values and in the sterol profile.KEYWORDS: Juglans regia L.; walnut; chemical composition; fatty acid composition; sterol composition;nutritional valueINTRODUCTIONNuts are important components of the Mediterranean diet,which is thought to be a healthy one and has been consideredas one of the best in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention(1). From preagriculture times to the present day, nuts have beeneaten as part of the human diet, providing macronutrients andmicronutrients, as well as other bioactive constituents. A recentdecline in the consumption of nuts was probably due to concernsabout ingesting fatty foods. Walnuts, for example, are 60%fat (fresh weight). Although total fat intake is certainly relatedto health risks, there is now general agreement that the moreimportant issue, where health is concerned, is the type of fat orfatty acids that are consumed. In fact, fatty acid compositioncan influence various physiological and biochemical processes,including blood pressure regulation, glucose metabolism, lipidicmetabolism, platelet aggregation, and erythrocyte deformability(2).Walnut fat is mostly unsaturated, and unsaturated fatty acidshave been associated with beneficial effects on serum lipids.Compared with most other nuts, which contain mostly mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), walnuts are highly enrichedin omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA),which are essential dietary fatty acids. Epidemiological andclinical trials suggest that omega-3 PUFA might have asignificant role in the prevention of CHD. Several mechanismswere suggested for that action, including antiarrhythmic, hy-polipidemic, and antithrombotic roles (3, 4). Several epidemio-logical studies to evaluate the effect of nuts on CHD have beenconducted during the past decade (5-8). They showed that theinclusion of whole food nut consumption in the diet had asignificant protective benefit with respect to fatal and nonfatalCHD events. Studies were also conducted specifically onwalnuts, finding that frequent consumption of moderate quanti-ties of walnuts favorably modified the lipoprotein profile anddecreased serum levels of total cholesterol (9, 10).Nuts are also rich in phytosterols, which, due to theirstructural similarity with cholesterol, inhibit its intestinal absorp-tion, thereby lowering total plasma cholesterol and low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) levels (11, 12). Epidemiologic and experi-mental studies have been made suggesting that dietary phy-tosterols may offer protection from cancers such as colon, breast,and prostate cancers (13, 14).Assessment of the identity and quality of vegetable oilsobtained from different sources is a challenge to the foodindustry in their efforts to meet consumer expectations. Gener-ally this involves many tests, including analysis of fatty acidand sterol compositions because these are probably the mostimportant major and minor components, respectively (15).* Corresponding author (telephone 351.222078934; fax 351.222003977;e-mail rseabra@ff.up.pt).† Servicüo de Farmacognosia.# Present adress: Escola Superior de Tecnologia e de Gesta˜o.‡ Servicüo de Bromatologia.§ Escola Superior Agra´ria.7698 J. Agric. Food Chem. 2003, 51, 7698−770210.1021/jf030451d CCC: $25.00 © 2003 American Chemical SocietyPublished on Web 11/19/2003Tabulated data on food composition generally include only meanvalues on fat composition, but there are several factors such asthe cultivar, geographical origin, and agricultural practices thatcan affect compositional values (16, 17).More detailed research focusing on the nutritional quality andhealth-promoting components of walnuts will enhance ourknowledge and encourage walnut consumption. Although therehave been some data published on the subject (15, 18-24), theyinclude mean values, and there is no information concerningthe cultivars grown in Portugal. In this investigation, six cultivarsof walnuts growing in the same experimental orchard andsubjected to the same agricultural practices were analyzed fortotal fat, moisture, crude protein, ash, carbohydrates, oxidativestability, and peroxide value. The chemical study was extendedto 18 fatty acids and 8 phytosterols to determine any differencesin the compositional profiles of the analyzed cultivars.MATERIALS AND METHODSSamples. Six walnut (J. regia L.) cultivars, Franquette, Marbot,Mayette, Mellanaise, Lara, and Parisienne, were studied. The trees wereidentified and carefully marked. The walnut fruits were gathered byhand in “Quinta de Santa Apolo´nia”, an orchard in Bragancüa, in thenortheastern region of Portugal (6° 46′ W, 41° 49′ N, 670 m elevation).The orchard has 24 walnut trees (2 of cvs. Mellanaise, Marbot, Mayette,and Parisienne; 4 of cv. Lara; and 12 of cv. Franquette) with a plantingdensity of 7  7 m. All trees are >18 years old. They are pruned whennecessary, and they receive organic fertilization but not phytosanitarytreatments. The surrounding soil is tilled to control infestation andirrigated in summer (July and August).The walnut fruits were harvested in the crop year 2001 (September),and a final sample of 2 kg was taken. After harvest, walnut fruitswere immediately transported to the laboratory and held in an oven(UL60, Memmert, Germany) for 3 days at 30 °C. The fruits were storedin the shell, closed in plastic bags, and frozen to -20 °C, until theanalyses.Sample Preparation. Before chemical analysis the walnuts weremanually cracked and shelled and then chopped in a 643 MX coffeemill (Moulinex, Spain). To obtain oil for further analysis, finely choppednuts (15 g) were extracted with light petroleum ether (bp 40-60 °C)in a Soxhlet apparatus, and the remaining solvent was removed byvacuum distillation. The extracted oil was kept in tubes over anhydroussodium sulfate and flushed with nitrogen. The tubes were carefullywrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 4 °C until the analyses.Chemical Analysis. Analyses of moisture, total fat, ash, and proteincontents were carried out in duplicate. Moisture was determined at 100( 2 °C (5 g test sample) with an SMO 01 infrared moisture balance(Scaltec, Goettingen, Germany) (25). Ash, crude protein (N  5.3),and total fat contents were determined according to AOAC OfficialMethods (26). Carbohydrate content was estimated by difference ofthe other components using the following formula: carbohydrate content) 100% - (% moisture + % protein + % fat + %ash) (27). Energywas expressed as kilocalories, using the factors proposed by Greenfieldand Southgate (28).Oxidative Stability (OS). The oxidation induction time wasmeasured on a Rancimat apparatus (Metrohm CH series 679, Herisau,Switzerland). Air with a 20 L/h flow was bubbled through the oil (3.0mL) heated at 110 ( 0.2 °C. The volatile compounds released duringoxidation were collected to a cell containing water, and the increasingwater conductivity was continually measured. The time taken to reachthe conductivity inflection point was recorded as the induction time.Peroxide Value (PV). PV was evaluated following the NP-904(1987) method (29). It consists of the reaction in darkness of a mixtureof oil and chloroform/acetic acid 2:3 (v/v) with a saturated potassiumiodide solution. The free iodine released was titrated with a sodiumthiosulfate solution. The peroxide value was expressed as milliequiva-lents of active oxygen per kilogram of oil (mequiv/kg). A secondevaluation was carried out 1 year later. Freshly extracted oils were usedfor these determinations, and at least two determinations were performedfor each sample.Fatty Acid Composition. Fatty acids were determined by gas-liquidchromatography with flame ionization detection (GLC-FID)/capillarycolumn based on the method used by Oliveira et al. (30) with minormodifications. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared byhydrolysis with a 11 g/L methanolic potassium hydroxide solution,methyl esterification with BF3/MeOH, and extraction with n-heptane.The fatty acid profile was analyzed with a Chrompack CP 9001chromatograph (Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equippedwith a split-splitless injector, a FID, and a Chrompack CP-9050autosampler. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 230and 270 °C, respectively. Separation was achieved on a 50 m  0.25mm i.d. fused silica capillary column coated with a 0.19 ím film ofCP-Sil 88 (Chrompack). Helium was used as carrier gas at an internalpressure of 120 kPa. The column temperature was 160 °C, for a 1 minhold, and then programmed to increase to 239 °C at a rate of 4 °C/minand then held for 10 min. The split ratio was 1:50, and the injectedvolume was 1.2 íL. The results are expressed in relative percentage ofeach fatty acid, calculated by internal normalization of the chromato-graphic peak area. Fatty acid identification was made by comparingthe relative retention times of FAME peaks from samples withstandards. A Supelco (Bellefonte, PA) mixture of 37 FAMEs (standard47885-U) was used (Table 1). In addition, the fatty acid isomers cis-9-trans-12-octadecadienoate (C18:2ö6ct), trans-9-cis-12-octadecadi-enoate (C18:2ö6tc), and cis-11-octadecenoate (C18:1ö7) were iden-tified with individual standards also purchased from Supelco.Sterol Composition. Sterol composition was evaluated by GLC-FID/capillary column following the NP EN ISO 12228 (1999) method(31). Briefly, after the addition of 1.0 mL of internal standard solutionTable 1.

Thetrimethylsilyl ethers were obtained by the addition of 1-methylimidazoleand N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-heptafluorobutyramide (MSHFBA).The sterol profile was analyzed on the same equipment used for fattyacid analysis, with a 30 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 ím DB-5MS column(J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) with a maximum operating temperatureof 325 °C. The temperatures of the injector and the detector were both320 °C. The column temperature was 250 °C and programmed toincrease at a rate of 2 °C/min to 300 °C and then held for 12 min. Thecarrier gas used was helium at an internal pressure of 100 kPa. Thesplit ratio was 1:50, and the injected volume was 1.5 íL. The totalsterol content was determined considering all peaks of sterols elutedbetween cholesterol and ¢7-avenasterol. Identification was achievedby comparing the relative retention times from samples with thoseobtained with standards. Standards used for identification werepurchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and included cholestanol,cholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, â-sitosterol, â-sitostanol, andbetulin (Table 2). Campestanol, clerosterol, ¢5-avenasterol, and ¢7-avenasterol were tentatively identified by comparison with references(15, 18, 31). â-Sitostanol and ¢5-avenasterol eluted very close, andtherefore they were quantified as ¢5-avenasterol.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTable 3 shows the results of the chemical compositionobtained for the six cultivars of walnuts analyzed. Fat was thepredominant component, followed by protein and carbohydrates,confirming the high energy value of nuts. In general, the valuesdetermined were in agreement with those published previously(19, 20). The values obtained by Savage et al. (19) whenstudying 12 cultivars of walnuts grown in New Zealand were,on average, higher for moisture (6.1%) and crude protein(14.6%) but slightly lower for total fat (63.0%) than thoseobtained with walnuts grown in Portugal (4.2, 13.7, and 64.6%,respectively). Rugeri et al. (20) studied four cultivars of walnutsgrown in Italy and obtained, on average, higher values for crudeprotein (15.7%) and total fat (67.4%). The cv. Franquette, incomparison with the analyses by Rugeri et al. (20), had differentvalues for almost all parameters. This can possibly be explainedby the different geographical origin or other factors such asagricultural practices. The energy values determined ranged fromTable 2.

(20).The results for fatty acid composition, total saturated fattyacids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the studied cultivars are shownin Table 4. The major fatty acid found in Portuguese sampleswas linoleic acid (C18:2ö6), followed by oleic acid (C18:1ö9),R-linolenic acid (C18:3ö3), palmitic acid (C16:0), and stearicacid (C18:0). Besides these five main fatty acids, 13 more wereidentified and quantified. Some of them were already described,but, as far as we know, C18:1ö9t, C18:2ö6ct, C18:3ö6, C20:2ö6, C22:0, C22:2ö6, and C22:5ö3 are now reported, for thefirst time, in this matrix. PUFA were the main group of fattyacids in walnut oil extracted from the studied cultivars, rangingfrom 70.7 to 74.8%; MUFA group ranged from 15.8 to 19.6%,and SFA were the minor group, ranging from 8.9 to 10.1%.Considering total MUFA content, cv. Lara had the lowest valuebut contained the highest PUFA content, also being the cultivarwith the highest value of linoleic acid. The cv. Mayette had thehighest MUFA value and the lowest PUFA value but, interest-ingly, was the cultivar with the highest value of R-linolenic acid.The main fatty acids were found, in general terms, in amountssimilar to those already described for walnuts grown in NewZealand (21, 22) and in Italy (20) with some differences, namely,stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1ö9), linolenic (C18:3ö3), andeicosenoic (C20:1ö9) acids. cis-Vaccenic acid (C18:1ö7),reported to occur for the first time in walnuts by Savage et al.(22), was also found in Portuguese samples. Trans isomers ofunsaturated fatty acids were detected in trace amounts in all ofthe studied cultivars as well as ç-linolenic (C18:3ö6) and C20:2ö6. C22:2ö6 and C22:5ö3 were also present in minutequantities but were not detected in cvs. Franquette and Parisi-enne.In what concerns oxidative stability (Table 5) the six cultivarsshowed some homogeneity. All of them presented low valuesfor OS, which confirms that walnut oil is relatively unstablewhen compared to other common plant oils (22). This can beascribed to its high content of PUFA.The results found for PV (Table 5) are within the range ofvalues found for other walnuts (22) except for cv. Lara, whichexhibited a very high value. One year after the first analyses,the pattern of PV values has changed: the PV of cv. Laradecreased, the PV of cvs. Marbot and Mellanaise rose consider-ably, and the values for the other three cultivars remainedconstant. This behavior is different from that described in thework published by Savage et al. (23). In this mentioned work,all nine analyzed cultivars showed a similar curve for PV: thevalues rose during the first and second years and decreased inthe third year. This decrease is explained by the decompositionof peroxides during the progression of the autoxidation process.The behavior observed with the cultivars now under study pointsto differences among them. These results cannot be explainedby the parameters that were studied in this work, because thevalues registered for total PUFA are not distinct enough to beresponsible for such differences. Most probably this can beexplained by the presence of different amounts of antioxidantsand/or pro-oxidants in the samples.Total phytosterols are present in amounts from 0.1 to 0.2%of total oil. These values are in agreement with those alreadydescribed for walnuts (15, 18) and are in the same range ofthose found in olive, peanut, and hazelnut oils but lower thanthose found in the majority of other oils (15, 18). The identifiedcompounds are listed in Table 6. The major ones (â-sitosterol,¢5-avenasterol, and campesterol) were already reported to occurin walnuts and in similar amounts (15, 18, 31). Besides thesecompounds, cholesterol and clerosterol were also found in allsamples, and three others (stigmasterol, ¢7-sigmasterol, and ¢7-avenasterol) were detected at least in some cultivars. Sampleswere also checked for cholestanol and campestanol, but neitherof them was detected.According to some authors (18) sterol distribution is rathertypical for each plant family, and the evaluation of the totalsterol content and the sterol profile is a good tool to assessauthenticity. However, no data were found in the literatureconcerning cultivars. In this work some differences among thesamples were observed, pointing to different phytosterol profiles.The cvs. Parisienne and Mellanaise showed the lowest contentof â-sitosterol and, consequently, total phytosterols. Cv. Parisi-enne is also the cultivar with the lowest amounts of cholesterol,campesterol, and ¢5-avenasterol. Cvs. Franquette and Mayettewere the only cultivars in which ¢7-stigmasterol was present.Stigmasterol was not detected in cvs. Lara and Parisienne. Incvs. Mayette and Parisienne ¢7-avenasterol was undetectable.Cv. Franquette was the only cultivar that contained all phy-tosterols identified.In conclusion, walnuts are a rich source of PUFA (70%).Among these fatty acids, linolenic acid, which has beenassociated with health benefits, is present in a considerableamount (12%). Walnuts also contain several phytosterols,which have been used as “nutraceuticals” as it appears that theyTable 5.

Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 51, No. 26, 2003 7701can inhibit intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Differences wereobserved among the studied cultivars, especially in PV and insterol profile. Cv. Mayette is the cultivar with the lowest valuesof PUFA and PV and with the highest values of MUFA,R-linolenic acid, and OS. More studies need to be made in thecoming years to confirm the conclusions here reported, but thedata registered so far seem to indicate that the six analyzedcultivars are chemically different. Further studies, focusing onantioxidant and pro-oxidant components present in walnuts,should also be made to arrive at some explanation for thedifferent behaviors in what concerns PV.LITERATURE CITED(1) Medeiros, D.
