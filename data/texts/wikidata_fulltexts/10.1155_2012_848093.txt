They contain many kinds of triterpenoid compounds, mainly including glycosides (asiaticoside and madecassoside) andcorresponding aglycones (asiatic acid and madecassic acid). To identify which is the major active constituent, a comprehensiveand comparative study of these compounds was performed. In vitro, primary human skin fibroblasts, originating from healthyhuman foreskin samples, were treated with various concentrations of asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, andmadecassic acid,respectively. Cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, MMP-1/TIMP-1 balance, and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway were investigated.In vivo, mice were orally administered with the four compounds mentioned above for two weeks after burn injury. The speed andquality of wound healing, as well as TGF-β1 levels in skin tissues, were examined. Interestingly, in contrast to prevalent postulations,asiaticoside and madecassoside themselves, rather than their corresponding metabolites asiatic acid and madecassic acid, arerecognized as the main active constituents of C. asiatica herbs responsible for burn wound healing. Furthermore, madecassosideis more eﬀective than asiaticoside (P = 0.0446 for procollagen type III synthesis in vitro, P = 0.0057 for wound healing speed, andP = 0.0491 for wound healing pattern in vivo, correspondingly).1. IntroductionBurn injury is a dermal or other organic tissue injurymainly caused by thermal or chemical insults, and includesscalds, contact, and flame burns [1]. According to the reportpresented by World Health Organization (WHO) at the year2002, it was estimated an annual casualty of 330,000 deathswas, directly or indirectly, related to burn injury [2].Immediately after burn injury, skin responds to theaﬄiction with a complex, however, well-orchestrated, woundhealing process. The central zone of coagulation consistsof irreversible cell and tissue necrosis due to direct thermalinjury. Neutrophils and later monocyte-derived macro-phages are attracted to the wound in response to a con-stellation of chemoattractants secreted from platelets in thehemostatic clot [3]. Growth factors, especially transforminggrowth factor (TGF), are released after the activation ofmacrophages by necrotic debris, and gradually tuning theinflammatory setting into a milieu that favors fibroblastproliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis [4].As a self-limited process, normal wound healing ends upwith a remodeling phase characterized by apoptosis of myofi-broblasts and macrophages, secretion of matrix metallopro-teinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases(TIMPs) from fibroblasts, which finally recovers the textureand strength close to normal state [5].Any derailment in the wound repair process wouldlead to a variety of ailments, including chronic woundhealing [6], hypertrophic scar [7], and keloid [8]. Consid-ered as a major threat to public health, abnormal woundrepair also lays a heavy burden on the economy [9].Therefore, attempts to facilitate wound repair have neverbeen staggered. Unfortunately, current clinical applicationof antibiotics, single cytokines, and growth factors showed2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine(1) Asiaticoside(2) Madecassoside(3) Asiatic acid(4) Madecassic acidR1 = HR1 = OHR1 = HR1 = OHR2 = Glu-Glu-RhaR2 = Glu-Glu-RhaR2 = HR2 = HCH3CH3CH3CH3CH3H3CCOOR2HHHR1HOHOHOH2CFigure 1: Chemical structures of asiaticoside, madecassoside,asiatic acid, and madecassic acid.unsatisfactory therapeutic eﬀects [10]. As a complementaryalternative, Centella asiatica herbs have been used orallyand topically to improve wound repair for years [11]. Asshown in Figure 1, triterpenoid compounds occurring inC. asiatica, mainly including two glycosides (asiaticosideand madecassoside) and corresponding aglycones (asiaticacid and madecassic acid), are considered to be majoringredients with pharmacological activities [12]. Previousindependent studies have showed that both asiaticoside andmadecassoside could facilitate burn wound healing possiblyvia enhancing collagen I synthesis [13–15]. On the otherhand, current studies on the two aglycones asiatic acidand madecassic acid focus on their proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory eﬀects [16–19]. Hence, our group postulatedthat madecassoside, administered orally, might exert anti-inflammatory eﬀects in collagen II-induced arthritis micethrough its intestinal metabolic product madecassic acidbut not itself [20], which was further supported by Won etal. [18]. Nevertheless, which is the main active constituentfor burn wound healing eﬀects of C. asiatica herbs; andhow asiaticoside and madecassoside function after oraladministration needs to be clarified.Therefore, this study was designed to investigate theeﬀects of the four major triterpene constitutes in C. asiaticaas mentioned above on in vitro collagen synthesis and invivo burn wound healing, simultaneously. A comprehensivecomparison and analysis should enable us to understand theactual active constituents of C. asiatica herbs for burn woundhealing.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Chemicals and Reagents. Madecassoside (C48H78O20,MW: 975.12), asiaticoside (C48H78O19, MW: 959.12), made-cassic acid (C30H48O6, MW: 504.70), and asiatic acid(C30H48O5, MW: 488.70) were generous gifts from Dr.Zhunan Gong, and the purities (≥98%) were determinedby HPLC-ELSD. A voucher specimen (Gong 0703 : 1–4,resp.) was maintained in the Center for New Drug Research& Development, College of Life Science, Nanjing Nor-mal University. Cell-Light EdU Apollo 567 DNA in vitrokit was purchased from RiboBio Co. Ltd. (Guangzhou,China). EasyScript First-Strand cDNA synthesis SuperMixand EasyTaq DNA Polymerase used for RT-PCR wereproducts of TransGen Biotech (Beijing, China). ELISA kitsfor procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) andprocollagen type III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP) detec-tion were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis,MN, USA). Anti-Smad 3, anti-phospho-Smad 3 and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) werepurchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).2.2. Primary Cell Culture. Primary human skin fibroblastswere obtained from healthy foreskin samples of patients withablative surgery via enzymatic digestion. All the experimentswere conducted in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinkiand were approved by the Ethics Committee of ZhongdaHospital (Nanjing, China). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’smodified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY,USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 100U/mL streptomycin and100U/mL penicillin. All in vitro assays were conducted usingcells between passage 2 and passage 6.2.3. Cell Proliferation Assay. Fibroblasts (1 × 105 cells/well)were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated in full mediaovernight. Cells were synchronized with a 24 h serum-freetreatment before the addition of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine(EdU) with or without the treatment of four triterpenecompounds (1, 3, 10 μM). After a 48 h-incubation, cellswere fixed and permeabilized for EdU detection accordingto the manufacturer’s protocol. Hoechst 33342 was appliedto locate the nucleus. Cells were photographed using afluorescence microscope (Olympus). The proliferation ratewas calculated by normalizing the number of EdU-positivecells to the Hoechst 33342-stained cells in nine randomfields.2.4. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis. After treatment with varying concentrationsof four triterpene compounds (1, 3, 10 μM) for 24 h, cellulartotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA) and reverse-transcribed according to theEasyScript kit’s protocol. Primers used for collagen type I,collagen type III, MMP-1, TIMP-1, TGF-β1, TβRI, TβRII,Smad 7, and β-actin were listed in Table 1. PCR productswere separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Photos were taken and gene expressions werequantified by using Image J imaging software (US NationalInstitute of Health, Bethesda, MD) via densitometry.2.5. Quantitative Detection of Procollagen I and ProcollagenIII. The contents of procollagen I and procollagen III weredetermined by commercial kits, which were capable ofdetecting procollagen I N-terminal peptide (PINP) and pro-collagen III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP) via enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cells (2 × 105 cells/well)were seeded in 48-well plates and incubated at 37◦C with 5%CO2. Procollagen contents in supernatants were measuredaccording to manufacturer’s protocol after cells were treatedwith diﬀerent concentrations of four triterpene compounds(1, 3, 10 μM) for 24 h.2.6. Western Blot Analysis. Cells, pre-incubated with diﬀerentconcentrations of four triterpene compounds (1, 3, 10 μM)for 24 h, were collected and lysed on ice in cell lysis buﬀerfor 30min, and centrifuged for 5min at 12,000 rpm. Fiftymicrograms of protein samples were separated on 10%SDS-PAGE and later transferred to polyvinylidene difluo-ride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were incubatedwith specific anti-Smad 3 (1 : 1000), anti-phospho-Smad 3(1 : 1000) and anti-GAPDH (1 : 5000) primary antibodies at4◦C overnight, followed by incubation with HRP-conjunctsecondary antibodies for 1 h. Protein bands were visualizedthrough Luminata Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Mil-lipore, Billerica, MA), and the optical density of each bandwas determined by using Image J.2.7. Animals. Male ICR mice, weighing between 18–22 g,were purchased from the experimental animal center ofChina Pharmaceutical University. Animals were housed ina room with a constant temperature (22 ± 1◦C) and a 12-h light-dark cycle, and fed with standard diet and water adlibitum. All experiments were performed strictly under theguidance of the Ethical Regulations for Institutional AnimalCare and Use of China Pharmaceutical University.2.8. Burn Injury Model and Drug Administration. Full-thickness burn injury was conducted following a publishedprotocol [21]. In brief, mice (n = 120) were anesthetizedwith pentobarbital (40mg/kg, i.p.). Back hair was removedand direct contact between a brass rod (65 g, 1 cm indiameter) heated to 95◦C and the back skin was kept for 9seconds to induce full-thickness burn wound. Equal molarof four triterpene compounds were dissolved in distill water,and administered orally (6, 12, 24mg/kg for asiaticoside andmadecassoside; 3, 6, 12mg/kg for asiatic acid and madecassicacid) for 14 consecutive days. Control group (n = 24)was handled in the same way except for administeringdistill water. Wound was photographed, and the areas weremeasured on days 0, 3, 7, 11, 14 by using Image J. At the sametime points, the total wounds were biopsied and fixed in 10%formalin for further analysis.2.9. Histological Assessment. Formalin-fixed tissue specimenswere embedded with paraﬃn and sectioned serially at 5 μm.Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)for histologic analysis and were scored by professionalhistologists from a cluster of aspects including: (1) necrosisand ulcer; (2) edema and inflammatory cell infiltration; (3)granulation tissue formation; and (4) re-epithelialization.Moreover, Masson’s trichrome stain was performed to estab-lish a clearer vision on extracellularmatrix (ECM) depositionin order to specify collagen amount and arrangement.2.10. TGF-β1 Immunohistochemistry. Mouse wound tissuesections obtained at post-burn 7 and 14 days were sectionedserially at 5 μm. Slides were incubated with anti-TGF-β1primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 1 h, andfollowed by development with DAB Envision System (DAKO,Ely, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.2.11. Statistical Analysis. All data were expressed as mean± standard deviation (SD). Diﬀerences between controland experimental groups were analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s test, andP < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. All thecalculations were performed using SPSS statistical software(SPSS, Chicago, IL).3. Results3.1. Eﬀects of Four Triterpene Compounds on the Proliferationof Human Skin Fibroblasts. As fibroblasts played a pivotal4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinerole in wound healing, they were used for in vitro studies.During the granulation tissue formation period, ECM,mainly collagen type I and type III, was synthesized andsecreted by fibroblasts. The proliferation of skin fibroblastsmight be directly linked to faster ECM deposition and conse-quent accelerated wound healing. Therefore, we investigatedthe eﬀects of four triterpene compounds on the proliferationof skin fibroblasts via EdU assay. As shown in Figure 2, alltest compounds at concentrations (1, 3, 10 μM) could notenhance cell proliferation, as compared with control group.3.2. Eﬀects of Four Triterpene Compounds on CollagenSynthesis of Human Skin Fibroblasts. Collagen, especiallytype I and type III collagen in skin tissue, is of greatbenefit to wound healing. Therefore, we investigated theeﬀects of four triterpene compounds on collagen synthesisin skin fibroblasts. The results were exhibited in Figure 3.Both asiaticoside and madecassoside (3, 10 μM) significantlyelevated mRNA levels of collagen type I and type III infibroblasts as determined by RT-PCR (Figures 3(a)–3(c)),as well as protein levels of procollagen type I and type IIIas detected by ELISA (Figures 3(d) and 3(e)). In contrast,neither asiatic acid nor madecassic acid could influencecollagen synthesis in fibroblasts as compared with control.Furthermore, it is noteworthy that madecassoside was moreeﬀective than asiaticoside at 10 μM (P = 0.0446).3.3. Eﬀects of Four Triterpene Compounds on Collagen Degra-dation of Human Skin Fibroblasts. Collagen synthesis is notthe only contributor to ECM deposition. During granulationtissue formation and consequent remodeling period, MMP-TIMP system plays a crucial role in collagen degradation aswell. MMP-1, also known as collagenase I, could degradevarious types of collagen, while TIMP-1 inhibits the activityof MMP-1. Therefore, both MMP-1 and TIMP-1 mRNAexpressions were investigated via RT-PCR. As TIMPs bindwith MMPs usually in stoichiometrical fashions of 1 : 1or 2 : 2, the ratio of MMP-1 to TIMP-1 should be moreintuitive to describe the pharmacological activities of fourtriterpene compounds on collagen degradation. As depictedin Figures 4(a)–4(d), although madecassoside (3 μM) couldsignificantly enhanced TIMP-1 mRNA expression, the fourcompounds failed to aﬀect MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio in humanskin fibroblasts.3.4. Eﬀects of Four Triterpene Compounds on TGF-β/SmadPathway of Human Skin Fibroblasts. TGF-β/Smad signalpathway, mainly including TGF-β1 and relevant receptorsTβRI, II as well as Smad 3 and 7, is deeply involved in theactivation, diﬀerentiation to myofibroblasts, and resultantcollagen synthesis of fibroblasts. To recognize the mecha-nisms by which the triterpene constituents from C. asiaticaaccelerated collagen synthesis, the eﬀects on TGF-β/Smadpathway of human skin fibroblasts were explored. The resultswere exhibited in Figure 5. Both asiaticoside (10 μM) andmadecassoside (3, 10 μM) significantly increased TGF-β1and TβRII mRNA expression, decreasing Smad 7 mRNAexpression and elevating phosphorylation levels of Smad 3in fibroblasts, while they had no influence on TβRI expres-sion (Figures 5(a)–5(g)). In contrast, neither asiatic acidnor madecassic acid could influence TGF-β/Smad pathwayin fibroblasts as compared with control. Furthermore, itshould be noted that madecassoside was more eﬀective thanasiaticoside at 10 μM (P = 0.0487), which was consistentwith above results on collagen synthesis.3.5. Eﬀects of Four Triterpene Compounds on Burn WoundHealing in Mice. In vitro assays described above showed thattwo glycosides asiaticoside and madecassoside, rather thantheir aglycones asiatic acid and madecassic acid, were ableto concentration-dependently enhance collagen type I andtype III synthesis mainly through activating skin fibroblastsvia TGF-β/Smad pathway, and madecassoside showed morepotent eﬀect than asiaticoside (P = 0.0446). To verify this,a wound healing test was performed. As shown in Figures 6and 7, both asiaticoside and madecassoside not only acceler-ated wound healing, but also result in a better wound healingpattern in a view of histological examination. Madecassoside(24mg/kg)-treated group showed significantly better woundhealing speed and wound healing results as compared withasiaticoside (24mg/kg)-treated group (P = 0.0057 and P =0.0491, correspondingly).The immunohistochemical-stains of TGF-β1 (Figure 8)were also consistent to above results. At day 7 post-burn,there were dark stains in infiltrated macrophages and fibrob-lasts in two glycosides-treated groups. While at day 14 post-burn, DAB stains could be merely seen in glycosides-treatedgroups, whichmight be the consequence of faster maturationof granulation tissue. Furthermore, neither asiatic acid normadecassic acid could facilitate burn wound healing.4. DiscussionAs a traditional herbal medicine in China and southeasternAsia for ages, Centella asiatica (Umbelliferae) was applicablefor a wide range of indications, such as ulcers, leprosy,and psoriasis. However, promoting wound healing is itsprimary application [12, 22]. Aisaticoside, madecassoside,asiatic acid, and madecassic acid were reported as majorconstituents of C. asiatica with pharmacological activities[23]. Previous independent studies have disclosed that C.asiatica extract, together with two glycosides, namely asi-aticoside and madecassoside, could facilitate wound healingeither induced by surgical or thermal injuries [13, 15, 24].However, whether asiaticoside or madecassoside is moreeﬀective in accelerating wound healing remains unknown. Inthe present study, we investigated the wound healing eﬀectsof four major constitutes of C. asiatica in a comprehensiveand comparative way. Our in vitro assay results were in linewith the prior reports that asiaticoside and madecassosidecould elevate collagen synthesis via activating TGF-β/Smadsignaling pathway. In vivo assay further confirmed thatasiaticoside and madecassoside are entities with woundhealing activities in C. asiatica, and madecassoside showeda faster healing speed under macroscopic observation anda better healing pattern from the histological aspect thanEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5Hoechst 33342EdUMergedCtrlHoechst 33342EdUMergedAD (1 μM) AD (3 μM) AD (10 μM) MD (1 μM) MD (3 μM) MD (10 μM)AA (1 μM) AA (3 μM) AA (10 μM) MA (1 μM) MA (3 μM) MA (10 μM)(a)Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10050100150200ADMDAAMANormalized proliferationrate (%)(μM)(b)Figure 2: Eﬀects of asiaticoside (AD), madecassoside (MD), asiatic acid (AA), and madecassic acid (MA) on the proliferation of huamnskin fibroblasts.

Noteworthily,asiatic acid andmadecassic acid, which are the metabolites ofasiaticoside and madecassoside and were formerly assumedas active entities of C. asiatica, showed no wound healingactivities either in vitro or in vivo, as compared to the controlgroup.Burn wound healing is composed of three overlappingstages, which are inflammation, granulation tissue formationand remodeling [5]. A series of coagulation cascade is initi-ated by burn injuries, which forms a platelet plug, later on afibrin matrix. Served as a temporary scaﬀold for infiltratingcells, the fibrin matrix is replaced by granulation tissueand plays a role in keratinocyte migration. Macrophage,which secretes TGF-β, attracts fibroblasts from the woundedge or from bone marrow to the wound area [25]. Thereare three isotypes of TGF-β, namely TGF-β1, TGF-β2, andTGF-β3. Among which, TGF-β1 is closely related to wound6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineCtrl 1 3 10 Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Collagen III                   Collagen I                       Collagen III                 Collagen I      Collagen III              Collagen I                       Collagen III                      Collagen I                          AD MDAA MAβ-actinβ-actinβ-actinβ-actin(a)00.511.52Relative mRNA levelsof collagen ICtrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)∗∗∗∗(b)00.511.52Relative mRNA levels of collagen IIICtrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)∗∗∗(c)01020304050PINP (ng/mL)Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)ADMDAAMA∗∗∗∗(d)01020304050PIIINP (ng/mL)Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)ADMDAAMA∗ ∗∗∗(e)Figure 3: Eﬀects of asiaticoside (AD),madecassoside (MD), asiatic acid (AA), andmadecassic acid (MA) on collagen synthesis in human skinfibroblasts.

Our in vitro RT-PCR assay showed thatasiaticoside and madecassoside could elevate TGF-β1 mRNAexpression in skin fibroblasts after the possibility of cellproliferation was excluded. Further in vivo observation viaimmunohistochemistry displayed dark stains of TGF-β1 ininfiltrated macrophages and fibroblasts at day 7 post-burnin both asiaticoside- and madecassoside-treated groups, sug-gesting that asiaticoside and madecassoside might facilitateburn wound healing via inducing TGF-β1 expression.TGF-β first binds to TGF beta type II receptor (TβRII),and later the heterodimer was recruited to TGF betatype I receptor (TβRI), and leads to the phosphorylationof TβRI. Receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), includ-ing Smad 2 and Smad 3, are then phosphorylated andtranslocated to the nucleus with the participation of co-SMAD, Smad 4. Smad 7, acting as an inhibitory Smad,competes with R-SMADs for receptor binding and thusabrogates TGF-β signaling transduction [26]. Under thestimulation of TGF-β1, fibroblasts proliferate and secreteextracellular matrix (ECM), mainly collagen type I and typeIII, and also partially diﬀerentiate into myofibroblasts whichcontribute to an accelerated closure by contraction [27].Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7TIMP-1MMP-1TIMP-1MMP-1TIMP-1MMP-1TIMP-1MMP-1Ctrl 1 3 10ADCtrl 1 3 10AACtrl 1 3 10MACtrl 1 3 10MDβ-actinβ-actinβ-actinβ-actin(a)00.511.5Relative mRNA levelsof MMP-1Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)ADMDAAMA(b)00.511.5Relative mRNA levelsof TIMP-1Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)∗ADMDAAMA(c)00.511.5Ratio  ofMMP-1/ TIMP-1Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10Ctrl 1 3 10(μM)ADMDAAMA(d)Figure 4: Eﬀects of asiaticoside (AD), madecassoside (MD), asiatic acid (AA), and madecassic acid (MA) on the expressions of MMP-1 andTIMP-1mRNA in human skin fibroblasts.

Elevated procollagen type I and type III expression bothat mRNA and protein levels have been observed in bothglycosides-treated groups. Furthermore, at 10 μM, madecas-soside was significantly more potent than asiaticoside inelevating procollagen type III synthesis, which could accountfor a faster and better wound healing in our burn woundhealing model (P = 0.0446).Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitorof metalloproteinases (TIMPs) system also contribute tothe ECM deposition, not only in the granulation tissueformation stage, but also in the remodeling period. Dysreg-ulation of MMP synthesis and/or disorder of MMP/TIMPbalance have been shown in chronic wounds, such as diabeticfoot ulcers [29]. MMP-1, a major collagenase, can degradecollagen, while TIMP-1 inhibits the activity of MMP-1 [30].Although madecassoside could significantly enhance TIMP-1 mRNA expression at the concentration of 3 μM, a moreaccurate predictor for wound healing, the ratio of MMP-1 to TIMP-1, showed no significant alteration in all fourcompounds-treated groups.Taken together, we draw a conclusion that the two gly-cosides could facilitate wound healing probably throughactivating fibroblast, not simply through enhancing cell pro-liferation. The activation of TGF-β/Smad pathway, as evi-denced by elevated p-Smad 3 level, raised TGF-β1 and12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineTβRII mRNA levels and downregulated Smad 7 expression,might contribute to the facilitation eﬀect of C. asiatica inburn wound healing. Both in vitro and in vivo findingsconfirmed that asiaticoside and madecassoside themselvesare the active entities. However, the metabolites of the twoglycosides, at least the corresponding aglycones, are not,which is contrast to the former presumption proposed byour group and other researchers [18, 20, 25]. Taken togetherwith our unpublished data on pharmacokinetic study ofasiaticoside and madecassocide after oral administration,herein we postulate that asiaticoside and madecassoside mayhave a special absorption and distribution pattern underburn injury condition. More detailed studies are warrantedto clarify the action pattern and mechanisms of asiaticosideand madecassoside for wound healing eﬀects.In conclusion, the present study has identified the activeconstituents of C. asiatica herbs on burn wound healingvia both in vitro and in vivo assays. It is noteworthy thatmadecassoside possess a more potent therapeutic eﬀect thanasiaticoside (P = 0.0446 for procollagen type III synthesis invitro, P = 0.0057 for wound healing speed and P = 0.0491for wound healing pattern in vivo, correspondingly), and thecorresponding aglycones of the two glycosides are not theentities with wound healing activities of C. asiatica.Authors’ ContributionF.
