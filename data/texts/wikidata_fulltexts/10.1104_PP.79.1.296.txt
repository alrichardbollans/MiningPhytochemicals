ABSTRACT
The principal biologically active cytokinins in xylem exudate of young
Phaseolus valgaris L. plants were identified by bioassay, high-perform-
ance liquid chromatography, enzymic degradation and combined gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (selected ion monitoring) a zeatin
riboside, zeatin nucleotide, dihydrozeatin riboside, dihydrozeatin nucleo-
tide, O-glucosyl zeatin, O-glycosyl dihydrozeatin, O-glucosyl dihydrozea-
tin riboside, and O-glucosyl dihydrozeatin nucleotide. Trace amounts of
O-glucosyl zeatin riboside and O-glucosyl zeatin nucleotide were also
detected.
The major cytokinins in leaves, stems and roots of Phaseolus
vulgaris L. have been rigorously identified by physicochemical
methods (10, 14, 21, 22), and there exists a wealth ofinformation
on cytokinin metabolism in this species as a result of studies
using quantitative MS (9), bioassay (e.g. 1, 4, 7, 19), and radio-
labeled cytokinins (e.g. 10, 11, 15). The nature and distribution
of cytokinin-active ribonucleosides in P. vulgaris tRNA has been
determined (2, 3) and this species has also been used as a model
system to study cytokinin biosynthesis (8). Although the design
and interpretation of these and other physiological experiments
would benefit greatly from knowing the identity of translocated
bean cytokinins, to date such analyses have provided only limited
bioassay data (4, 7, 19). The present study seeks to identify the
biologically active cytokinins in bean xylem exudate through
high resolution chromatography and mass spectroscopic analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bean plants (P. vulgaris cv Hawkesbury Wonder) were grown
in 2-L plastic pots containing sterilized garden soil, in a glass-
house, under full sunlight, 16 h days, and a temperature range
of 18 to 32°C. Every 2 d, starting I week after germination, each
plant received 100 ml of Hewitt's complete nutrient solution
containing 12 mm nitrate (6). Plants were harvested 20 d after
germination, at a stage ofdevelopment which has been correlated
with high root system conductance (5), by decapitatingjust above
the cotyledonary node. Exudate was removed continually for 1
h from the cut surfaces using a microsyringe, and transferred to
a beaker containing 50 ml extraction solvent (methanol/chloro-
form/formic acid/water, 12:5:1:2), chilled to -5°C. A total of
24.6 ml exudate was collected from 120 plants.
Exudate was stored in extraction solvent overnight at -5°C,
then purified as described previously (10), by cation-exchange
on cellulose phosphate, followed by alkaline phosphatase treat-
ment of the acidic/neutral fraction, and partitioning of both the
basic fraction (containing cytokinin bases and glycosides) and
phosphatased fraction (containing nucleotide-derived cytokinins)
against butan- 1-ol at pH 8.0. The two butanol-soluble fractions
were then purified by reversed-phase HPLC, as described previ-
ously (17). Initially, a Waters uBondapak C-18 column (7.8 mm
x 30 cm) was used to effect a preparative separation ofcytokinin
bases, ribosides, and glucosides (Fig. 1; Table I). All HPLC
solvents contained a constant concentration (0.1 M) of acetic
acid. Samples were injected in 10% methanol (0.5 ml) and eluted
with a concave gradient (Waters Gradient 9) of 10 to 30%
methanol for 10 min, followed by 30% methanol isocratically
for 20 min, at 2 ml min-'. The first 20 ml was discarded, and
the next 40 ml collected as ten 4 ml fractions (Fig. 1). One-eighth
of each fraction was removed and tested for cytokinin activity
using the soybean cotyledon callus assay (12).
The four fractions showing biological activity were then puri-
fied separately by analytical reversed phase HPLC and analyzed
by GC-MS. To improve recovery and assist in identification, 2.0
Ag ofan appropriate pentadeuterated internal standard was added
to each biologically active fraction before analytical HPLC.
Standards used were: (2H5)ZR,' (2H5)DZR, and (2H5)OGDZ
synthesized as described by Summons et al. (16). Since these
cytokinin analogs are also biologically active, they were not added
to the extract until after the bioassay.
The cytokinin glucoside-like fractions 1 and 3 (Fig. 1) were
each diluted with (2H5)OGDZ and analyzed using a Waters C8
radial compression column (8 x 100 mm), eluted with a linear
gradient of 10 to 40% methanol in 15 min, at 3 ml min-' (system
A). The cytokinin riboside-like fractions 2 and 4 (Fig. 1) were
each diluted with both (2H5)ZR and (2H5)DZR and analyzed on
the same column, using a linear gradient of 30 to 40% methanol
in 20 min, at 3 ml min-' (system B). The resolution of systems
A and B is shown in Table I. Fractions were collected every 30
s, or according to peaks ofUV absorbance (280 nm). Glucoside-
like fractions were first treated with ,6-glucosidase, as described
previously (12), then purified as their aglycones on HPLC system
B before derivatization.
The TMS derivatives ofcytokinin ribosides (12), and tBuDMS
derivatives of cytokinin bases (13) were prepared as described
previously. Chemical ionization GC-MS was performed on a
Finnigan 4500 instrument, interfaced to a Nova 4 computer,

introduced via a Hewlett Packard high performance fused silica
capillary column (25 m x 2 mm), operated isothermally at 280°C.
Mass spectra were recorded in ammonia reagent gas at 1 torr,
140 ev, and a source temperature of 120°C. Each sample was
scanned for the presence and intensity ofthe following diagnostic
(MH+) ion masses along the GC elution profile: 448 (tBuDMS-
Z), 450 (tBuDMS-DZ), 455 (tBuDMS)(2H5)DZ), 640 (TMS-
ZR), 642 (TMS-DZR), 645 (TMS-(2H5)ZR), 647 (TMS-
(2H5)DZR).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Bioassay of samples following preparative HPLC revealed
cytokinin activity in four broad fractions. Comparison of bioas-
say profiles (Fig. 1) with HPLC retention times of authentic
standards (Table I) indicated that both basic and nucleotide-
derived extracts contained a mixture of cytokinin ribosides,
bases, and/or glucosides. Further purification of these fractions
by analytical HPLC showed large peaks of UV-absorption co-
chromatographing with ZR, DZR, and OGDZ (attributable to a
combination of deuterated internal standards and endogenous
compounds), and smaller peaks co-chromatographing with OGZ,

as an internal standard, the unknown fraction was treated with j3-
glucosidase and purified as the putative aglycone, DZ, by HPLC. The
major UV-absorbing fraction, assumed to be a mixture of deuterated
and nondeuterated DHZ, was collected, derivatized, and analyzed by
GC-MS and SIM as a mixture of tBuDMS derivatives. Final identifica-
tion of the aglycone of the endogenous cytokinin glucoside as DZ was
based on the coincidence of ion-current peaks due to m/e 450 (MH+ for
tBuDMS-DZ) and m/e 455 (MH+ for tBuDMS_(2H5)-DZ) at the GC
retention time of authentic tBuDMS-DZ (see also Table I).

DZ,DZR and deuterated DZ, derived from basic glucosides; and
DZR derived from an acidic glucoside fraction. Low-intensity
molecular ions were detected for derivatized ZR, from both basic
and acidic glucoside fractions. An example of such an analysis is
shown in Figure 2.

PALMER AND WONG
Thus, eight major cytokinins were identified from bean exu-
date: ZR, DZR, OGZ, OGDZ, OGDZR and the nucleotides of
Z, DZ, and OGDZ. In addition OGZR and OGZ nucelotide
were identified as minor components. In relation to known
patterns of cytokinin metabolism in P. vulgaris (9-11, 14, 21,
22), it seems reasonable to assume that the glucosides of ZR,
DZR, Z-nucleotide, and DZ-nucleotide isolated from bean xylem
exudate are O-f3-i.-glucosyl side-chain conjugates. However, in a
recent analysis of cytokinins from Pinus radiata buds (18), a
novel ZR glycoside was isolated and tentatively identified by
GC-MS as 9-(glucosyl-f3-D-ribofuranosyl) zeatin. This compound
has not been isolated from P. vulgaris, but it should be noted
that if it does occur here, and as in the present study, the
cytokinin glucoside fractions are analyzed indirectly after en-
zymic hydrolysis, it may well be indistinguishable from OGZR.
In this experiment, to avoid interference in the bioassay,
deuterated cytokinin standards were added to samples only after
thorough purification by ion-exchange, solvent partition, and
HPLC. Although data such as those shown in Figure 2 permit
the quantification of cytokinins present in certain HPLC frac-
tions, they do not take into account the losses that may have
occurred prior to HPLC. Limited evidence from bioassay, UV-
absorbance, and relative ion intensities indicated that the most
abundant cytokinins were Z- and DZ-nucleotides, but it is not
possible to calculate actual concentrations of cytokinins in the
exudate other than to state that their levels appear to fall within
the range 10 to 100 ng ml-'. A summary of these results, and
those from other analyses of the same species is given in Table
II.
The distribution of endogenous cytokinins in P. vulgaris (Ta-
ble II), and in particular the remarkable accumulation of very
high levels ofOGDZ in the primary leaves of decapitated plants
(9), has been suggested to be due to the translocation ofZR and
Z-nucleotide from the roots, partial or complete metabolism of
these compounds to DZR and DZ-nucleotide (more stable
forms) in the stem, and finally glucosylation to OGDZ, appar-
ently the most stable bean cytokinin, in the leaves (10). Results
of the present study appear to support the hypothesis that DHZ-
derivatives originate in shoot tissues, since these compounds
were present in exudate from the base of the stem, whereas they
are reported to be absent from root tissues (14). However, with
the demonstration in this study of the presence of cytokinin 0-
glucosides in xylem exudate, it now seems likely that although
bean leaf tissue is known to be able to glucosylate Z and DZ
(I 1), OGDZ accumulation in the leaves could also be a result of
the import of the glucoside per se (Table II).
