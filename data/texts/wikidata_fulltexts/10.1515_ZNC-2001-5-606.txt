Naturforsch. 56c, 353-356  (2001); received January 23/February 26, 2001Phenylpropanoid Glycosides, Phillyrea latifolia, Secoiridoid GlycosidesAs a part of our studies on the biologically active substances from Spanish plants, we have undertaken an investigation of the chemical constituents of a typical mediterranean species, Phillyrea latifolia L. (Oleaceae). Two secoiridoid glycosides, three phenylpropanoid glyco­sides, one lignane and two triterpenic acids were isolated from the leaves of this species and identified. The phytochemical analysis of the aerial parts of P. latifolia revealed that it is a rich source of oleuropeoside.Oleaceae plants have been used for medicinal purposes and spices for many centuries. A number of biologically active substances have been iso­lated from plants of the Oleaceae. Secoiridoid gly­cosides are the major secondary metabolites in Oleaceae. Several plants of this family, e.g. Olea europaea, have been studied from a pharmacologi­cal point of view. Oleuropeoside is the major iri- doid in olive leaves. Clinical data on the beneficial effects of olive leaves in the treatment of hyper­tensive disease has been available since the 1950s (Hansel et al., 1996). This compound increased coronary blood flow and showed antiarryhthmic and spasmolytic effects (Ghisalberti, 1998). It showed a hypoglycemic effect and increased toler­ance of orally administered glucose (Trovato et al.,1993). In fact, olive leaves are used in folk medi­cine as an antidiabetic drug (Gonzalez et al., 1992). Oleuropeoside has also shown antimicrobial and has been shown to be a potent antioxidant en­dowed with antiinflammatory properties (Visioli et al., 1998a), it is a potent scavenger of superoxide radicals and inhibitors of neutrophil respiratory burst (Visioli et al., 1998b).A previous study of the constituents of the leaves from Phillyrea latifolia revealed that it is a rich source of oleuropeoside. Because of the re­ported pharmacological activities of this com­pound, we have undertaken an investigation of this species. Phillyrea latifolia is found in Spain,in the M editerranean Europe and in the north of Africa. P. latifolia leaves were well known in the Mediterranean historical medicine for their oro­pharyngeal antiinflammatory effects. At the pre­sent time the use of this species is as diuretic (Bal- lero and Fresu, 1993), as antipyretic (Bellakhdar,1997) and as antispasmodic against stomach aches (Merzouki et al., 1997). Aerial parts of P. latifolia showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococ­cus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Hus­sain and Tobji, 1997).No previous phytochemical study on Phillyrea latifolia leaves has been reported till now. This pa­per led to isolation of ursolic acid (1), oleanolic acid (2), phillyrin (3), ligustroside (4), oleuropeo­side (5), salidroside (6), coniferin (7) and syringin (8) from the leaves of Phillyrea latifolia.Materials and MethodsPlant material was collected in Jaen (Spain) (March, 1997) and identified by Pr. Carmen Barto­lome Esteban, Departm ent of Vegetal Biology, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain. A voucher specimen (CR 97) is kept in the University of Al­cala.Leaves of Phillyrea latifolia (800 g) were ex­tracted with acetone at room temperature. The ex­tract (46 g) was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 and eluted by M eOH to afford four frac-tions (F r F4). Fraction F2 (24 g) was submitted to CC on silica gel (G-60, 26-40 (i, Merck) using a linear gradient of CHCl3/MeOH (97/3; 95/5; 93/7; 90/10; 85/15 v/v) to afford ten main groups of frac­tions (A r A 10). Fractions A 2 and A 3 yielded ur­solic acid (83 mg, 1) and oleanolic acid (136.4 mg, 2), respectively. Fraction A 6 (557.4 mg) was puri­fied by flash chromatography on silica gel and eluted succesively by CHC13, CHCl3/MeOH (98/2) and M eOH affording phillyrin (16 mg, 3) andligustroside (23 mg, 4). Fraction A 8 (1.9 g) on fur­ther flash chromatography on silicagel[CHCl3,CHCl3/M eOH (98/2) and MeOH] gaveoleuropeoside (404 mg, 5). Fraction A 9 (2.8 g) wassubmitted to flash chromatography on silicagelusing as eluents CHCl3/M eOH (95/5) and (90/10)to obtained oleuropeoside (233 mg, 5), salidroside(65.3 mg, 6), coniferin (42 mg, 7) and syringin(30.4 mg, 8).Results and DiscussionIn our study of the phytochemistry of this spe­cies we have isolated compounds 1-8 from the ace- tonic extract. Structures of isolated compounds are shown in Figure 1.The !H and 13C NMR data of all compounds were assigned using a variety of 2D-NMR experi­ments including ’H^H-COSY, HMQC, HMBC and NOESY experiments. Identification and as­signment of the isolated compounds were per­formed by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those of authentic samples (oleanolic and ur­solic acids, Extrasynthese, France) and/or pre­viously reported data (Damtoft et al., 1992; Inouye and Nishioka, 1972; Maillard et al., 1992; Chiba et al., 1980).’H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (in CD3OD, TMS as int. standard; chemical shifts in 6 ppm) were obtained using Bruker WM spectrometer [300 MHz ( lH  NMR) and 75 MHz (13C NMR)].The results obtained from analysis of isolated compounds were:Phillyrin (3): 13C NMR: 51.2 (C-l), 83.3 (C-2),72.0 (C-4), 55.8 (C-5), 89.0 (C-6), 70.7 (C-8), 132.8 (C -l'), 110.8 (C-2'), 147.8 (C-3'), 150.3 (C-4'),112.8 (C-5'), 119.2 (C-6'), 137.5 (C-l"), 111.5 (C- 2"), 149.5 (C-3"), 150.9 (C-4"), 118.0 (C-5"), 119.8 (C-6"), 56.7 (3"-OCH3), 56.5 (4'-OCH3), 56.4 (3'- OCH3), 102.8 (C-l'"), 74.9 (C-2'"), 78.2 (C-3'"), 71.3 (C-4'"), 77.8 (C-5'"), 62.4 (C-6'").Ligustroside (4): 13C NMR: 95.13 (C-l), 155.14 (C-3), 109.32 (C-4), 31.82 (C-5), 41.24 (C-6), 173.18 (C-7), 124.91 (C-8), 130.49 (C-9), 13.58 (C- 10), 168.64 (C -ll), 51.90 (C-12), 66.90 (C -l') , 35.19 (C-2'), 130.0 (C-3'), 130.99 (C-4'), 116.27 (C-7'), 130.99 (C-8'), 100.80 (C-l"), 74.77 (C-2"), 78.45 (C- 3"), 71.48 (C-4"), 77.95 (C-5"), 62.78 (C-6").Oleuropeoside (5): !H NMR: 5.90 (H -l), 7.5 (H-3), 3.95 (H-5), 2.43 and 2.69 (H-6a and H6b), 6.06 (H-8), 1.65 (H-10), 3.70 (H-12), 4.19 and 4.09 (H- l ' a and H - l 'b), 2.75 (H-2'), 6.65 (H-4'), 6.67 (H- 7'), 6.53 (H-8'), 4.79 (H-l"), 3.35 (H-2"), 3.40 (H- 3"), 3.35 (H-4"), 3.35 (H-5"), 3.87 and 3.66 (H-6"a and H-6"b); 13C NMR: 95.3 (C-l), 155.1 (C-3),109.4 (C-4), 31.8 (C-5), 41.3 (C-6), 173.2 (C-7),124.9 (C-8), 130.8 (C-9), 13.5 (C-10), 168.7 (C -ll),51.9 (C-12), 66.8 (C -l'), 35.4 (C-2'), 130.8 (C-3'),116.5 (C-4'), 146.2 (C-5'), 144.9 (C-6'), 117.1 (C- 7'), 121.3 (C-8'), 101.0 (C-l"), 74.8 (C-2"), 78.0 (C- 3"), 71.5 (C-4"), 78.4 (C-5"), 62.8 (C-6").Salidroside (6): !H NMR : 4.00 and 3.68 (H-l^ and H -lb), 2.81 (H-2), 7.04 (H-4), 6.67 (H-5), 6.67 (H-7), 7.04 (H-8), 4.26 (H -l') , 3.15 (H-2'), 3.32 (H- 3'), 3.26 (H-4'), 3.23 (H-5'), 3.83 and 3.64 (H -6'a and H-6'b); 13C NMR: 72.1 (C-l), 36.4 (C-2), 130.7 (C-3), 130.9 (C-4), 116.1 (C-5), 156.5 (C-6), 116.1 (C-7), 130.9 (C-8), 104.4 ( -1 ') ,  75.1 (C-2'), 78.1 (C-3'), 71.7 (C-4'), 78.0 (C-5'), 62.8 (C-6').Coniferin (7): ]H NMR: 4.21 (H -l), 6.32 (H-2), 6.54 (H-3), 6.74 (H-5), 6.74 (H-9), 4.86 (H -l') , 3.45 (H-2'), 3.40 (H-3'), 3.40 (H-4'), 3.20 (H-5'), 3.77 and 3.66 (H-6ä and H-6'b); 13C NMR: 63.5 (C-l),130.1 (C-2), 131.3 (C-3), 135.0 (C-4), 105.6 (C-5), 154.4 (C-6), 135.3 (C-7), 154.4 (C-8), 105.6 (C-5),57.1 (-OCH3), 105.4 (C -l'), 75.8 (C-2'), 77.9 (C- 3'), 71.4 (C-4'), 78.4 (C-5'), 62.7 (C-6').These compounds have been isolated for the first time from Phillyrea latifolia.The Phillyrea genus comprises three species: P. media, P. angustifolia and P. latifolia. Among these only P. media has furnished oleuropeoside (Popov et al., 1975).Considering the bioactivity of oleuropeoside, and olive leaves, it is important to take into ac­count the fact that Phillyrea latifolia also possesses a high amount of oleuropeoside. The presence of this compound, increases the possible pharmaco­logical value of this species, because we now re­port that it is a potential source of oleuropeoside.Siringin ConiferinSalidrosideHjCOPhillyrinOCHaOleuropeoside LigustrosideOleanolic acidFig. 1.
