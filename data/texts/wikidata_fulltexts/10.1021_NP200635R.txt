The structures of compounds 1−14were elucidated through spectroscopic techniques andchemical methods. In addition, the structures of withanolides1, 2, 3, and 6 were confirmed by X-ray crystallographicanalysis. Using a MTS viability assay, eight withanolides (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16, and 19) and four acetylated derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a,and 2b) showed potent cytotoxicity against human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (JMAR and MDA-1986), melanoma(B16F10 and SKMEL-28), and normal fetal fibroblast (MRC-5) cells with IC50 values in the range between 0.067 and 9.3 μM.Classically defined withanolides are a group of C28ergostane-type steroids with a C-22,26 δ-lactone group,first isolated from the genus Withania.1 They are presentprimarily in the Solanaceae family, which includes the generaAcnistus, Datura, Dunalia, Jaborosa, Nicandra, Physalis, andWithania.2−9 Withanolides have attracted interest in recentyears mainly due to their exhibition of significant biologicalactivities, inclusive of antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflamma-tory, immunomodulatory, and insect-antifeedant activities.2,3,6It has been reported that those withanolides displaying themost promising antitumor characteristics contain an α,β-unsaturated ketone in ring A, a 5β,6β-epoxy group in ring B,and a nine-carbon side chain with an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactonegroup.10 The typical withanolide withaferin A (16) (Figure 1)contains these three moieties and has been shown in vitro andin vivo to suppress the growth of an array of tumor cells,including breast, pancreatic, prostate, lung, leukemia, and headand neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), by inducingapoptosis,11 thus possessing potential application as anantiproliferative agent. As part of an ongoing study ofwithanolides from plant sources,11,12 a library of 224 nativeplant extracts from the U.S. Great Plains was evaluated forcytotoxic activities against HNSCC and melanoma cell linesusing the MTS viability assay. One of the most promising leads,Physalis longifolia Nutt. (Solanaceae), commonly known as“long leaf groundcherry”, was subjected to a phytochemicalinvestigation, and the results are presented herein, including thedetails of the isolation and structure elucidation of 14 newwithanolides (1−14), four acetylated derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a,and 2b), and eight known compounds (15−22). Theircytotoxicity was determined against HNSCC (JMAR andMDA-1986), melanoma (B16F10 and SKMEL-28), and normalfetal fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. This constitutes the first reportof a phytochemical and bioactivity study of P. longifolia.■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe CH2Cl2−MeOH (1:1) extract of the aerial parts of the titleplant and the EtOAc-soluble and n-BuOH-soluble fractionsshowed cytotoxicity against the above-mentioned cells withIC50 values in the range between 0.7 and 9.8 μg/mL using aMTS assay. All compounds (1−22) were isolated from theEtOAc-soluble or n-BuOH-soluble fractions (see ExperimentalSection).Compound 1 was isolated as colorless cuboid crystalsobtained from a CH2Cl2−CH3CN mixture, a major metabolitein the EtOAc-soluble fraction. Its molecular formula, C28H38O7,was determined by HRESIMS and NMR experiments, equatingto 10 double-bond equivalents. Its IR absorptions revealed thepresence of hydroxy (3431 and 3233 cm−1), keto (1671 cm−1),and ester (1706 cm−1) groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1)showed the presence of three methyl groups at δ 0.60 (3H, s),0.90 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz), and 1.97 (3H, s), seven protonsattached to oxygenated carbons at δ 3.18 (1H, brs), 3.52 (1H,d, J = 6.1 Hz), 3.65 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz), 4.17 (1H, d, J = 9.6Hz), 4.23 (1H, d, J = 12.5 Hz), 4.28 (1H, d, J = 12.5 Hz), and4.33 (1H, dt, J = 13.3, 3.4 Hz), and two olefinic methine groupsat δ 6.16 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz) and 6.95 (1H, dd, J = 10.0, 6.1Hz). The 13C NMR (APT) and HSQC spectra for 1 (Table 2)displayed 28 carbon signals differentiated as three CH3, eightCH2 (including two oxygenated at δ 61.0 and 56.7), 10 CH(including two olefins at δ 145.7 and 132.9, three oxygenated atReceived: August 11, 2011Published: November 18, 2011Articlepubs.acs.org/jnp© 2011 American Chemical Society andAmerican Society of Pharmacognosy 2532 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200635r | J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−2544δ 78.8, 68.0, and 61.8), and seven C (including one ketocarbonyl at δ 200.7, one ester carbonyl at δ 167.4, two olefins atδ 154.3 and 125.6, and one oxygenated at δ 61.5), correspondingto C28H35. The remaining three hydrogen atoms were thereforeassigned to three OH groups, indicating that six rings must bepresent in the structure.The NMR data of 1 were very close to those obtained forwithaferin A 16,1,13 a six-ring withanolide isolated as anothermajor compound in this study (Tables 1−3 and Figure 1).Compound 1 was found to contain the following moieties alsoobserved in 16: an α,β-unsaturated ketone in ring A ([13C: δ200.7 (C-1), 132.9 (C-2), 145.7 (C-3); 1H: δ 6.16 (H-2, d, J =10.0 Hz), 6.95 (H-3, dd, J = 10.0, 6.1 Hz)]; an epoxy group inring B [13C: δ 61.5 (C-5), 61.8 (C-6); 1H: δ 3.18 (brs, H-6)];and a nine-carbon side chain with an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactonegroup [13C: δ 78.8 (C-22), 154.3 (C-24), 125.6 (C-25), 167.4(C-26); 1H: δ 4.33 (H-22, dt, J = 13.3, 3.4 Hz)]), as supportedby 1H−1H COSY and HMBC experiments. The obviousdifferences between 1 and 16 were the presence of anoxygenated methylene [C-19, 13C: δ 61.0; 1H: δ 3.65 (1H, d,J = 9.6 Hz), 4.17 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz)] in 1 and a methyl carbon[C-19, 13C: δ 17.6; 1H: 1.38 (3H, s)] in the latter, suggestingthat 1 is a 19-hydroxy derivative of 16. This observation wassupported by the high-frequency shift of C-10 (δ 54.3 in 1 andδ 47.9 in 16), the low-frequency shifts of C-1 (δ 200.7 in 1 andδ 202.5 in 16), C-5 (δ 61.5 in 1 and δ 64.1 in 16), and C-9 (δ43.9 in 1 and δ 44.3 in 16) in the 13C NMR spectra, and theHMBC correlations between H2-19 [3.65 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz),4.17 (1H, d, J = 9.6 Hz] and C-1, C-5, C-9, and C-10.Acetylation of 1 with acetic anhydride in pyridine gave twoderivatives, the 4,19,27-triacetate (1a) and the 4,27-diacetate(1b) (Tables 1 and 2), which proved the presence of hydroxygroups at C-4, C-19, and C-27 by a high-frequency shift of H-4(from δ 3.52 in 1 to δ 4.79 in 1a and to δ 4.73 in 1b), of H2-19(from δ 3.65, 4.17 in 1 to δ 4.32, 5.07 in 1a), and of H2-27 (δ4.23, 4.28 in 1 to δ 4.84, 4.88 in 1a and to δ 4.85, 4.88 in 1b)and by HMBC correlations between H-4 and the estercarbonyl, between H2-27 and the ester carbonyl, and betweenH2-19 and the ester carbonyl in 1a and 1b.Finally, the structure of 1 was confirmed through a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment (Figure 2). Thus, 1(withalongolide A) was established as 19-hydroxywithaferinA. The full assignments of NMR data of 1, measured in CDCl3with a trace amount of CD3OD and in C5D5N (Tables 1Figure 1. Withanolides 1−21 and rutin (22) isolated from Physalis longifolia.Journal of Natural Products Articledx.doi.org/10.1021/np200635r | J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−25442533and 2), were obtained by 2D-NMR methods including 1H−1HCOSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY spectra.Compound 2 was isolated as colorless rod crystals from aCH2Cl2−CH3C6H5 mixture and was also a major metabolitefrom the EtOAc-soluble part. Its molecular formula, C28H38O6,was determined by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. The IRand NMR (1H and 13C) data (Tables 1 and 2) were similar tothose of 1. Analysis of the 1D- and 2D-NMR data for 2identified resonances consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ketonein ring A [13C: δ 200.2 (C-1), 133.1 (C-2), 145.4 (C-3); 1H: δ6.23 (H-2, d, J = 10.4 Hz), 7.01 (H-3, dd, J = 10.4, 6.4 Hz)], anepoxy in ring B [13C: δ 61.7 (C-5), 62.1 (C-6); 1H: δ 3.25 (brs,H-6)], a nine-carbon side chain with a δ-lactone group [13C: δ78.4 (C-22), 149.2 (C-24), 122.2 (C-25), 167.3 (C-26); 1H: δ4.31 (H-22, dt, J = 13.3, 3.4 Hz)], and an oxygenated C-19[13C: δ 62.1; 1H: δ 4.32, 3.77 (d, J = 9.7 Hz)]. The obviousdifferences between 2 and 1 were the presence of a 27-methylcarbon [13C: δ 12.7; 1H: 1.85 (3H, s)] in 2 and an oxygenatedmethylene [C-27, 13C: δ 56.7; 1H: δ 4.28 (1H, d, J = 12.5 Hz),4.23 (1H, d, J = 12.5 Hz)] in 1, suggesting that 2 is a 27-deoxyderivative of 1. This observation was supported by the 13CNMR chemical shift values of the δ-lactone moiety [δ 149.2(C-24), 122.2 (C-25), 167.3 (C-26) in 2 and δ 154.3 (C-24),125.6 (C-25), 167.4 (C-26) in 1], by the NMR data comparisonof the side chain moiety of 2 to those of 27-deoxywithanolides,14,15and by HMBC correlations of H3-27/C-24, C-25, and C-26.Acetylation of 2 with acetic anhydride in pyridine yieldedthe 4,19-diacetate (2a) and the 4-monoacetate (2b) (Tables 1and 2), which confirmed the presence of hydroxy groups at C-4and C-19 by a high-frequency shift of H-4 (from δ 3.63 in 2 toδ 4.79 in 2a and to δ 4.74 in 2b) and H2-19 (from δ 3.77, 4.32in 2 to δ 4.32, 5.07 in 2a).Finally, the structure of 2 was confirmed through a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment (Figure 3). Thus, 2(withalongolide B) was determined as 27-deoxy-19-hydrox-ywithaferin A.Compound 3 was isolated as colorless cube crystals from aCH2Cl2−CH3CN mixture, a minor component from theEtOAc-soluble fraction. Its molecular formula, C28H38O7, wasdetermined by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. The NMRdata of 3 (Tables 1 and 2) were also akin to those of withaferinA, 16.1,13 Analysis of the 1D- and 2D-NMR data of 3 identifiedresonances consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ketone in ring A[13C: δ 204.0 (C-1), 131.6 (C-2), 143.2 (C-3); 1H: δ 6.22 (H-2,d, J = 10.0 Hz), 6.96 (H-3, dd, J = 10.0, 6.5 Hz)], an epoxy inring B [13C: δ 64.5 (C-5), 63.0 (C-6); 1H: δ 3.23 (brs, H-6)],and a nine-carbon side chain with a δ-lactone group [13C: δ78.9 (C-22), 153.0 (C-24), 125.9 (C-25), 167.2 (C-26); 1H: δ4.39 (H-22, dt, J = 13.2, 3.5 Hz)].

Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−25442535between 3 and 16 were the presence of an oxygenated methine[C-11, 13C: δ 69.5; 1H: 4.15 (1H, brs)] in 3 and a low-frequency methylene [C-11, 13C: δ 22.3; 1H: δ 1.27 (1H, m),1.18 (1H, m)] in 16, implying that 3 is 11-hydroxywithaferin A.This observation was supported by the high-frequency shift ofC-9 (δ 48.1 in 3 and δ 44.3 in 16) and C-12 (δ 47.8 in 3 and δ39.5 in 16) and the low-frequency shift of C-8 (δ 27.0 in 3 andδ 29.9 in 16) in the 13C NMR spectrum; by the presence of thefragment −CH2−CH(OH)−CH−CH(CH2)−CH− (startingwith C-12 and ending with C-14) deduced from 1H−1H COSYand HSQC experiments; and by the HMBC correlationsbetween Hα-12 (δ 2.17, dd, J = 13.8, 2.8 Hz) and C-9 (δ 48.1),C-11 (δ 69.5), C-13 (δ 42.1), and C-14 (δ 58.2). Theorientation of the hydroxy group at C-11 was deduced as β dueto the broad single-peak pattern of H-11 (δ 4.15, brs), the smallcoupling constant of 3.3 Hz between H-9 (δ 1.25, dd, J = 10.8,3.3 Hz) and H-11, and ROESY correlations of H-11/H-9 andH-11/Hα-12. Finally, the structure of 3 was confirmed througha single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment (Figure 4).

Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−25442536the new withanolide 3 (withalongolide C) was established as11β-hydroxywithaferin A.Compounds 4 and 5 were isolated as two presumed artifacts.These two compounds were probably formed from with-alongolide A (1) and withalongolide C (3), respectively, by aMichael-type addition due to the use of CH3OH during theextraction procedure. It is possible that these compounds areformed in a similar fashion to 2,3-dihydro-3β-methoxywithafer-in A (17)1 (Tables 2 and 3), which was most likely derivedfrom withaferin A (16) during this study. Comparing the NMRdata of the methoxy group in 17 [−OCH3 group at C-3: 1H: δ3.32 (3H, s); 13C: δ 57.0; H-3: δ 3.68 (1H, ddd, J = 6.3, 3.2, 2.2Hz); C-3: δ 77.7] with both 4 and 5 [−OCH3: 1H: δ 3.35 (3H,s); 13C: δ 57.6; H-3: δ 3.70 (1H, ddd, J = 8.3, 3.4, 2.6 Hz); C-3:δ 77.7 in 4 and −OCH3: 1H: δ 3.34 (3H, s); 13C: δ 57.4; H-3: δ3.75 (1H, ddd, J = 6.5, 4.0, 2.2 Hz); C-3: δ 76.2 in 5] suggestedthe presence of a methoxy group at the C-3 positions in 4and 5. This was confirmed by the presence of a 1H−1H COSYfragment of −CH2−CH(OCH3)−CH(OH)− in ring A andHMBC correlation of OCH3/C-3 in both 4 and 5. Thestructures of 4 (withalongolide D) and 5 (withalongolide E)were determined by spectroscopic methods, and completeassignments of their NMR data are listed in Tables 2 and 3.Compound 6 was isolated as colorless cube crystals obtainedfrom a CH2Cl2−CH3CN mixture. Its molecular formula,C27H34O4, was ascertained by HRESIMS and NMR experi-ments (Tables 2 and 3). Similar to withaferin A (16), it showedsignals for four methyl groups [13C: δ 20.2 (C-28), 19.9 (C-19),13.6 (C-21), 12.1 (C-18); 1H: δ 2.01 (H3-28, s), 1.15 (H3-19,s), 1.01 (H3-21, d, J = 6.6 Hz), 0.75 (H3-18, s)], an α,β-unsaturated ketone in ring A [13C: δ 211.6 (C-1), 129.4 (C-2),155.2 (C-3); 1H: δ 5.93 (H-2, d, J = 6.4 Hz), 7.57 (H-3, d, J =6.4 Hz)], and a nine-carbon side chain with an α,β-unsaturatedδ-lactone group [13C: δ 57.7 (C-27), 79.0 (C-22), 153.1 (C-24), 125.9 (C-25), 167.3 (C-26); 1H: δ 4.42 (H-22, dt, J = 13.3,3.4 Hz), 4.37 (H-27, d, J = 12.5 Hz), 4.32 (H-27, d, J = 12.5)].A detailed comparison of the NMR data of 6 to those of 16indicated that both compounds share identical ring C, D andside chain moieties, but are different in their A and B rings.A five-membered ring A for 6 was proposed on the basis of thefollowing evidence: (1) the unusual chemical shift value of theconjugated ketone carbon (C-1, δ 211.6); (2) the couplingpattern of H-3 (δ 7.57, d, J = 6.4 Hz) and the small couplingconstant of 6.4 Hz between the olefinic protons H-2 and H-3when compared to those of H-3 (6.91, dd, J = 10.0, 5.9 Hz) in16, showing C-3 to be linked with a quaternary carbon in 6.This five-membered ring A and a C-5,6 double bond in ring Bwere supported by the HMBC correlations of H3-19/C-1, C-5(quaternary carbon, δ 147.4), C-9 (δ 42.8), and C-10 (δ 47.6);of H-2/C-1, C-3, C-5, and C-10; and of H-3/C-1, C-2, C-5, C-6(methine, δ 123.8), and C-10. Finally, the observation wasconfirmed through a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment(Figure 5). Thus, 6 (withalongolide F) was deduced to beA-nor-27-hydroxy-1-oxowitha-2,5,24-trienolide. This 4-norwi-thanolide with a 2,5-dien-1-one system was reported previouslyas a semisynthetic product derived from withaferin A by anacid-catalyzed rearrangement.16Compound 7 was a major compound isolated from theBuOH-soluble fraction. Its molecular formula, C28H40O11S, wasdetermined by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. The NMRdata of 7 (Tables 2 and 3) were similar to those of 2,3-dihydro-3β-O-sulfate-withaferin A (19) (Tables 2 and 3),17 anothermajor withanolide isolated from the BuOH-soluble fractionduring this study (Figure 1). The obvious differences between 7and 19 were the presence of an oxygenated methylene [C-19,13C: δ 59.9; 1H: δ 4.80 (1H, d, J = 9.4 Hz), 4.01 (1H, d, J = 9.4Hz)] in 7 and a methyl carbon [C-19, 13C: δ 15.9; 1H: δ 1.69(3H, s)] in the latter, suggesting that 7 is a 19-hydroxyderivative of 19. This observation was supported by the high-frequency shift of C-10 (δ 55.7 in 7 and δ 49.9 in 19), the low-frequency shift of C-1 (δ 208.0 in 7 and δ 209.7 in 19), C-5(δ 63.0 in 7 and δ 65.1 in 19), and C-9 (δ 42.3 in 7 andδ 43.1 in 19) in the 13C NMR spectrum, and the HMBCcorrelations of H2-19 [δ 4.01 (1H, d, J = 9.4 Hz), 4.80 (1H, d,J = 9.4 Hz]/C-1, C-5, C-9, and C-10 in 7. Thus, 7 (withalongo-lide G) was determined as 2,3-dihydro-19-hydroxy-3β-O-sulfate-withaferin A.Compound 8 was isolated as a major component from theBuOH-soluble fraction. Its molecular formula, C40H58O15, wasascertained by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. The NMRdata of 8 (Tables 4 and 5) showed similarities to those of 27-O-β-D-glucopyranosylwithaferin A (15) (sitoindoside IX)18(Tables 4 and 5) isolated during this study, suggesting 8 tobe a withanolide saponin. The aglycone of 8 was determined tobe withaferin A, as both 8 and 15 possess the superimposable1H and 13C NMR signals of the steroid aglycone moieties andboth showed the same main LC-MS/MS fragments of m/z 471and 281 due to the presence of a withaferin A moiety. Differingin the presence of only one glucose residue in 15, two sugarresidues were observed in 8 on the basis of the signals of twoanomeric carbons [methines, δ 105.3 (C-1′) and 103.1 (C-1″)]and their corresponding anomeric protons [δ 4.97 (H-1′, 1H, d,J = 7.8) and 5.94 (H-1″, 1H, s)]. Furthermore, the data for 8suggested that the compound had, besides a glucose unit, anadditional five oxygenated carbons (five methines) and onelow-frequency methyl group [13C: δ 19.0; 1H: δ 1.74 (3H, d,Figure 4. X-ray ORTEP drawing of withalongolide C (3).Figure 5. X-ray ORTEP drawing of withalongolide F (6).Journal of Natural Products Articledx.doi.org/10.1021/np200635r | J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−25442537J = 6.1 Hz)], corresponding to a rhamnose in the pyranose form.The rhamnose moiety was deduced by the detailed comparisonof the NMR data of 8 with those of rutin 22 {3-O-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)]-β-D-glucopyranosylquercetin} alsoisolated in this study and confirmed from the 1H−1H COSY,HSQC, and HMBC spectra when starting with the character-istic methyl group [C-6″, 13C: δ 19.0; 1H: δ 1.74 (3H, d, J = 6.1Hz)]. The α-anomeric configuration of the rhamnose unit wasassigned from the small coupling constant between H-1″ (1H, δ5.94, s) and H-2″ (1H, δ 4.73, s). Furthermore, the rhamnoseTable 4. 1H NMR Data for Withanolides 8−15 in C5D5N (500 MHz)pos. 8a 9b 10c 11d 12e 13f 14g 15h1 4.61 m Hα 2.74 m, Hβ2.10 m2 6.43 d (10.0) Hβ 3.48 dd (11.0,12.4)Hα 2.73 d(18.8)7.14 d (7.7) 3.01 dd (7.1, 15.5) 2.94 dd (8.1,15.2)Hα 1.96 m, Hβ1.80 m6.43 d (10.0)Hα 3.26 ddd (1.5,5.3, 12.4)Hβ 2.35 dd(10.2, 18.8)2.91 dd (3.7, 15.5) 2.91 dd (4.1,15.2)3 7.25 dd (10.0,6.3)4.29 m 4.84 m 7.34 t (7.7) 4.58 m 4.47 m 4.33 br 7.25 dd (10.0,6.3)4 4.05 dd (6.3,3.8)Hβ 3.07 dt (2.0,12.2)Hβ 2.95 t (12.5) 7.87 d (7.7) 3.63 td (3.2, 18.0) 2.68 dd (5.9,16.8)Hα 2.90 d (15.8) 4.05 dd (6.3,3.7)Hα 2.99 ddd (1.5,5.5, 12.2)Hα 2.88 dd(12.5, 5.0)2.92 m 2.58 td (2.7,16.8)Hβ 2.81 dd (2.2,15.8)6 3.28 s 5.75 brd (5.3) 5.92 brd (4.5) 5.26 dt (11.0,6.5)4.69 m Hα 2.26 m, Hβ2.09 m3.28 s7 2.13 dt (13.0,1.8)1.92 m, 1.53 m Hα 1.66 dd(11.0, 16.0)1.63 q (11.0) 2.23 m 1.98 m, 1.53 m 2.47 dd (3.6,16.0)2.13 dt (13.0,1.8)1.30 dd (11.5,13.0)Hβ 2.02 m 2.32 dd (6.5,11.0)2.00 m 1.30 dd (11.5,13.0)8 1.58 m 1.74 dt (5.3, 10.7) 2.20 m 1.73 q (11.0) 1.48 m 1.24 m 1.62 m 1.57 m9 1.06 m 1.94 m 2.32 m 2.71 t (11.0) 2.20 m 2.04 m 1.86 m 1.06 m11 2.02 m, 1.57 m 2.37 m, 1.96 m 2.15 m, 1,98 m 3.68 m, 1.46 m 2.96 m, 1.17 m 2.80 m, 2.34 m 1.84 m, 1.24 m 2.02 m, 1.57 m12 1.83 m, 1.03 m 1.95 m, 1.26 m 1.95 m, 1.02 m 1.95 m, 1.30 m 1.83 m, 1.17 m 1.82 m, 1.13 m 1.85 m, 1.03 m 1.85 m, 1.02 m14 0.86 m 0.97 m 0.86 m 1.10 m 0.95 m 0.90 m 0.88 m 0.86 m15 1.50 m, 0.96 m 1.50 m, 1.02 m 1.49 m, 1.06 m 1.52 m, 1.12 m 1.45 m, 1.02 m 1.44 m, 1.02 m 1.33 m, 0.88 m 1.50 m, 0.95 m16 1.49 m, 1.11 m 1.50 m, 1.14 m 1.91 m, 1.24 m 1.98 m, 1.27 m 1.95 m, 1.

Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−25442538was confirmed to be attached at C-4′ (δ 78.5) on the basis ofHMBC correlations of H-1″/C-4′ and H-4′/C-1″, alsosupported by the glycosylation shifts of C-4′ (δ 78.5 in 8 andδ 72.1 in 15), C-3′ (δ 77.1 in 8 and δ 79.0 in 15), and C-5′(δ 77.8 in 8 and δ 79.1 in 15). Thus, the structure of 8(withalongolide H) was determined as 27-O-[α-L-rhamno-pyranosyl(1→4)]-β-D-glucopyranosylwithaferin A.Compounds 9−14 were isolated as the minor componentsfrom the BuOH-soluble fraction. Withanolide 9 was assigned amolecular formula of C34H50O11 by HRESIMS and NMRexperiments. Its NMR data (Tables 4 and 5) exhibited a closeresemblance to those of withalongolide A (1), possessing thesame nine-carbon side chain with an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone,identical rings C and D, and an oxygenated C-19 methylenegroup. In addition, the remaining rings A and B showedsimilarities to those of 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-20,27-dihy-droxy-1-oxowitha-5,24-dienolide, a withanolide saponin re-ported from Physalis peruviana,19 with the following signals:(1) the occurrence of a ketone (δ 208.9, C-1) and a doublebond [13C: C-5 quaternary carbon, δ 132.8, and C-6 methine, δ129.1; 1H: δ 5.75 (1H, brd, J = 5.3 Hz, H-6)]; (2) a glucosemoiety attached to C-3 in ring A [13C: δ 75.9 (CH, C-3);characteristic signals for glucose: δ 103.5 (CH, C-1′), 79.1 (CH,C-5′), 79.1 (CH, C-3′), 75.6 (CH, C-2′), 71.9 (CH, C-4′), and63.0 (CH2, C-6′)]; (3) a fragment of −CH2−CH(O)−CH2−in ring A deduced from the 1H−1H COSY and HSQC spectra;(4) HMBC correlations of H-3/C-1′ and H-1′/C-3; of H2-19/C-1, C-5, C-9, and C-10; of H2-2/C-1, C-3, C-4, and C-10; andof Hβ-4/C-2,C-3, C-5, C-6, and C-10. Thus, the structure of 9(withalongolide I) was determined as 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-19,27-dihydroxy-1-oxo-witha-5,24-dienolide.Compound 10 was assigned a molecular formula ofC34H52O11 by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. Similar tothose of 9, the NMR data of 10 (Tables 4 and 5) displayed thepresence of an oxygenated C-19 methylene group [13C: δ 63.9CH2;1H: δ 4.32 (1H, d, J = 11.0 Hz), 4.11 (1H, d, J = 11.0Hz)] and three methyl groups [13C: δ 12.6, 13.0, 14.1; 1H: δ0.80 (s), 0.99 (d, J = 6.6 Hz), 2.04 (s)]. The obvious differencesbetween 10 and 9 were the presence of an oxygenated methine(δ 69.5) in 10 instead of the keto carbon (C-1, δ 208.9) in 9,implying that a hydroxy group is attached to C-1. This wassupported by the presence of a 1H−1H COSY fragment of−CH(O)−CH2−CH(O)−CH2− assigned as a C-1 to C-4moiety in ring A and confirmed by HMBC correlations of H2-19/C-1, C-5, C-9, and C-10 and of H2-4/C-2, C-3, C-5, C-6,and C-10. The orientation of the hydroxy group at C-1 wasassigned as α on the basis of the small coupling constant of H-1(δ 4.61, s)/H2-2. Furthermore, it was determined that theTable 5. 13C NMR Data for Withanolides 8−15 in C5D5N (125 MHz)pos. 8a 9 10 11 12 13 14 151 203.1 208.9 69.5 157.8 199.4 198.3 25.6 203.12 132.8 49.6 41.7 115.1 49.4 49.7 30.6 132.83 145.6 75.9 66.6 127.4 66.3 66.1 64.7 145.64 70.8 39.9 44.4 119.3 36.9 41.9 32.9 70.85 65.0 132.8 137.8 146.2 156.4 153.6 130.4 65.06 60.6 129.1 127.0 70.7 71.2 33.8 198.6 60.67 32.2 31.9 32.6 38.3 37.3 26.4 44.0 32.28 30.7 33.5 33.8 39.0 37.5 39.9 40.0 30.79 45.1 43.6 42.4 46.6 44.3 43.6 46.6 45.110 49.0 60.2 48.2 127.8 136.5 136.1 158.7 49.011 22.2 24.1 22.3 27.1 26.4 26.6 25.1 22.212 39.9 40.6 40.7 41.5 41.0 41.0 40.2 39.913 43.1 43.5 43.6 44.2 43.9 44.1 43.3 43.114 56.5 57.0 57.5 54.9 54.2 54.9 54.8 56.515 24.9 25.0 25.2 24.7 24.5 24.5 24.0 24.916 27.6 27.6 27.8 27.7 27.6 27.7 27.5 27.617 52.4 52.5 52.6 52.9 52.7 52.7 52.3 52.418 12.0 12.5 12.6 12.9 12.6 12.7 12.2 12.019 17.7 63.7 63.9 17.720 39.5 39.6 39.9 40.0 39.9 39.9 39.8 39.521 13.9 13.9 14.1 13.9 13.9 13.9 14.0 13.922 78.6 78.9 79.7 79.6 79.6 79.6 79.5 78.723 30.4 30.3 25.2 25.2 25.2 25.2 25.2 30.424 157.4 154.5 148.8 148.7 148.8 148.7 148.7 157.425 124.3 127.8 125.2 125.3 125.2 125.2 125.2 124.426 166.3 166.9 167.1 167.1 167.1 167.1 167.1 166.427 64.0 56.6 13.0 12.9 12.9 12.9 12.9 63.928 21.0 20.6 67.1 66.9 67.0 67.0 67.0 21.01′ 105.3 103.5 103.5 103.4 103.5 103.5 103.5 105.42′ 75.9 75.6 75.4 75.4 75.4 75.4 75.4 75.73′ 77.1 79.1 79.0 79.0 79.0 79.0 79.1 79.04′ 78.5 71.9 72.1 72.1 72.1 72.1 72.1 72.15′ 77.8 79.1 79.3 79.3 79.3 79.3 79.3 79.16′ 61.9 63.0 63.3 63.3 63.3 63.3 63.3 63.2a1″ (103.1), 2″ (73.1), 3″ (73.3), 4″ (74.5), 5″ (70.8), 6″ (19.0).Journal of Natural Products Articledx.doi.org/10.1021/np200635r | J.

Excluding the six carbonscorresponding to the glucose moiety, the 27-carbon aglyconimplied that one carbon in the C28 withanolide scaffold must belost. The NMR data of its aglycon were similar to those of1,6,27-trihydroxy-19-norwitha-1,3,5(10),24-tetraenolide (a 19-norwithanolide with an aromatic ring A).21 A trisubstitutedaromatic ring A in 11 was observed from the 1H NMR (H-2: δ7.14, 1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz; H-3: δ 7.34, 1H, t, J = 7.7 Hz; and H-4:δ 7.87, 1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz) and 13C NMR (C-1: δ 157.8 C; C-2:δ 115.1, CH; C-3: δ 127.4 CH; C-4: δ 119.3 CH; C-5: δ 146.2C; and C-10: δ 127.8, C) experiments. This was confirmed by1H−1H COSY and HSQC experiments and HMBC correla-tions of H-2/C-4 and C-10, H-3/C-1 and C-5, and H-4/C-2and C-10. Moreover, the HMBC correlations of H-4/C-6 (δ70.7 CH), of OH-6 (δ 6.81, d, J = 6.5 Hz)/C-5 and C-6, and ofH-7β/C-5 and the 1H−1H COSY fragment −CH(OH)−CH2−CH−CH−CH2−CH2− (corresponding to −C6−C7−C8−C9−C11−C12−) showed that both the aglycone of 16 and 1,6,27-trihydroxy-19-norwitha-1,3,5(10),24-tetraenolide have the sameplanar structural moieties in rings A and B. However, theorientation of the hydroxy group at C-6 was assigned as αbecause of the large coupling constants (11.0 Hz) between H-6(δ 5.26, dt, J = 11.0, 6.5 Hz) and H-7α (δ 1.63, q, J = 11.0 Hz)and (6.5 Hz) between H-6 and H-7β (δ 2.32, dd, J = 11.0, 6.5Hz). Thus, the structure of 11 (withalongolide K) wasdetermined as 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-1,6α-dihydroxy-19-norwitha-1,3,5(10),24-tetraenolide.Compound 12 was assigned a molecular formula ofC33H48O11 by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. Its NMRdata (Tables 4 and 5) were similar to those of withalongolide K(11), containing the same rings B, C, and D because of theirsuperimposable 1H and 13C NMR signals. The differencesobserved between 12 and 11 were caused by changes in thering A moiety. Unlike the aromatic ring A in 11, a conjugated5(10)-en-1-one system in 12 was revealed by the chemicalshifts of quaternary carbons at δ 199.4 (C-1), 156.4 (C-5), and136.5 (C-10). A 1H−1H COSY fragment of −CH2−CH-(OH)−CH2− was assigned as −C2−C3−C4− in ring A andconfirmed by the HMBC correlations of H2-2/C-1, C-3, andC-4 and of H2-4/C-2, C-5, and C-10. Thus, the structure of 12(withalongolide L) was determined as 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3β,6α-dihydroxy-1-oxo-19-norwitha-5(10),24-dienolide.Compound 13 was assigned a molecular formula ofC33H48O10 by HRESIMS and NMR experiments. Its NMRdata were similar to those observed for withalongolide L (12),containing a conjugated 5(10)-en-1-one system [13C: δ 198.3(C-1), 153.6 (C-5), 136.1 (C-10)] in ring A. The obviousdifference between 13 and 12 was the presence of a methylene(13C: δ 33.8; 1H: δ 2.30, 2H, m) instead of an oxygenatedmethine (13C: δ 71.2; 1H: δ 4.69), suggesting that 13 is a6-deoxy derivative of 12. This observation was supported by the13C NMR high-frequency shift of C-4 (δ 41.9 in 13 and δ 36.9in 12) and C-8 (δ 39.9 in 13 and δ 37.5 in 12), the low-frequency shift of C-7 (δ 26.4 in 13 and δ 37.3 in 12), andHMBC correlations of OH-3 (δ 6.81, 1H, d, J = 4.1 Hz)/C-2 (δ49.7), C-3 (δ 66.1), and C-4 (δ 41.9), of H2-4 (δ 2.68, dd, J =5.9, 16.8 Hz and δ 2.58, dd, J = 2.7, 16.8 Hz)/C-2, C-3, C-5(δ 153.6), C-6 (δ 33.8), and C-10 (δ 136.1), and of H-6β(δ 2.09, m)/C-4, C-5, C-7 (δ 26.4), C-8 (39.9), and C-10 in 13.Thus, the structure of 13 (withalongolide M) was determinedas 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3β-hydroxy-1-oxo-19-norwitha-5-(10),24-dienolide.Compound 14 was assigned a molecular formula ofC33H48O10 by HRESIMS and NMR experiments and as anisomer of withalongolide M (13). The NMR data of these twocompounds (Tables 4 and 5) were similar to each other, havingthe same functional groups and the same multiplicities for allother carbons present. A conjugated 5(10)-en-6-one system[13C: δ 198.6 (C-6), 158.7 (C-10), 130.4 (C-5)] in 14 wasproposed instead of the 5(10)-en-1-one one in 13 on the basisof the following observations: (1) a 1H−1H COSY fragment of−CH2−CH2−CH(OH)−CH2− (from C-1 to C-4) in ring A of14 replaced the ring A fragment −CH2−CH(OH)−CH2−(from C-2 to C-4) in 13; (2) a 1H−1H COSY fragment of−CH2−CH−CH− (from C-7 to C-9) in ring B of 14 replacedthe ring B fragment −CH2−CH2−CH−CH− (from C-6 to C-9) in 13; (3) HMBC correlations of H-2/C-1 (δ 25.6), C-3(δ 64.7), and C-4 (δ 32.9); of H2-7/C-5 (δ 130.4), C-6 (δ198.6), C-8 (δ 40.0), and C-9 (δ 46.6); and of H-1/C-3, C-5,and C-10 (δ 158.7). Furthermore, the orientation of thehydroxy group at C-3 was determined as α due to the smallcoupling constant (J = 2.2 Hz) between H-3 (δ 4.33, brs)/H-4β(δ 2.81, dd, J = 2.2, 15.8 Hz) and the NOESY correlationsof H-3/H-1β, H-2β, and H-4β. Thus, the structure of 14(withalongolide N) was assigned as 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3α-hydroxy-6-oxo-19-norwitha-5(10),24-dienolide.Eight known compounds were identified by comparison oftheir data with those published in the literature, as sevenwithanolides, sitoindoside IX (15),18 withaferin A (16),1,13 2,3-dihydro-3β-methoxywithaferin A (17),15 viscosalactone B(18),22 2,3-dihydro-3β-O-sulfate withaferin A (19),17 2,3-dihydrowithaferin A (20),15 and 3α,6α-epoxy-4β,5β,27-trihy-droxy-1-oxowitha-24-enolide (21),23 and a flavonoid glucoside,rutin (22).24 The full assignments of the NMR data of 15, 16,17, 18, and 19 are listed in Tables 2−5, as these data wereeither unavailable, incomplete, or in need of revision within thepublished literature.The classically defined withanolide-type steroids (1−21)isolated from the title plant showed a diversity of oxygena-tion patterns that may be summarized as follows: (1) Sixwithanolides (1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 10) have an oxygenated C-19group, which is rare in Nature. A literature investigation showedthat from the approximately 520 unmodified withanolides onlynine C-19 oxygenated withanolides have been reported so far.They are as follows: jaborosalactones O,25 V, W, X,26 46, 47,and 48,27 cinerolide,28 and bracteosin B.29 (2) Compounds 3and 5 are rare examples of unmodified withanolides having anoxygenated C-11, although withasomniferanolide (with an 11β-OH group),30 somniferanolide (with an 11β-OH group),30 andwitharifeen (with an 11α-OH group)31 have been previouslyreported. (3) Saponins 10−14 have a sugar constituentattached at C-28. Only two previously published withanolideJournal of Natural Products Articledx.doi.org/10.1021/np200635r | J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 2532−25442540saponins (physagulins E and G)20 have been shown to have asugar moiety at C-28 thus far. (4) Compounds 11−14 are thefirst reported examples of C-19 norwithanolide saponins. Itshould be noted, however, that there are only four C-19norwithanolides (jaborosalactones Q,21 7,32 and 45; 12-O-methyljaborosalactone 4527) reported in the literature. (5)Most withanolides have an oxygenated C-1 in ring A, but 15 isthe exception by not being oxidized at C-1. In addition, thepresence of a 3-O-sulfate group in naturally occurringwithanolides is extremely rare. Besides withanolides 7 and 19,there are only five other 3-O-sulfate withanolides previouslyreported from Datura metel,33 Solanum cilistum,34 and Withaniasomnifera.35All the withanolides (1−21) and the four acetylated deriva-tives (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b) were tested against the HNSCC(JMAR, MDA-1986), melanoma (B16F10 and SKMEL-28),and/or normal fetal fibroblast (MRC-5) cells for theircytotoxicity. As summarized in Table 6, withanolides 1−5, 7,8, 15, 16, and 19 and the four derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a, and2b) showed cytotoxic effects against the cells tested with IC50values in the range 0.067−9.3 μM, while the other withanolideswere inactive. Similar to withaferin A (16), withanolides 1−3,containing the functional groups of a 2-en-1-one in ring A, a5β,6β-epoxy in ring B, and a lactone ring in the side chain, wereactive, showing the importance of these three groups. Theactivity of the 3-O-sulfate withanolides 7 and 19 was due totheir transformations to 1 and 16, respectively. Withanolideglycosides 8 and 15 displayed less cytotoxicity relative to theiraglycone withaferin A (16). However, the esterification of thehydroxy groups at C-4, C-19, and C-27 increased the resultantcytotoxicity, as shown for the acetylated derivatives 1a and 2awith IC50 values less than 1 μM against all the cells tested.These results are in agreement with previous structure−activityrelationship reports.10,36,37 In addition, it should be noted thatwithalongolide A (1), withalongolide B (2), and withaferin A(16) are most likely responsible for the cytotoxic activities ofthe extract prepared from the title plant due to their relativelyhigh abundance levels (0.16% for 1, 0.10% for 16, and 0.03%for 2).■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures. Melting points wereobtained using an MPA100 melting point apparatus. Optical rotationswere measured with a Rudolph RS Autopol IV automatic polarimeter.IR data were obtained with a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IRspectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AV-400 orAV-500 instrument with a cryoprobe for 1H, APT, COSY/DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY/ROESY. Chemical shift valuesare given in δ (ppm) using the peak signals of the solvent C5D5N (δH8.74, 7.58, and 7.22; and δC 150.35, 135.91, and 123.87) or CDCl3 (δH7.24 and δC 77.23) as references, and coupling constants are reportedin Hz. ESIMS data were measured with an Agilent 1200 Series LC-MS/MS ion trap 6300 mass spectrometer. HRESIMS data werecollected with a LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer(Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Column chromatography wasperformed on silica gel (particle size 12−25 μm) (SorbentTechnologies, Atlanta, GA, USA), MCI CHP20P (particle size 75−150 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), or Sephadex LH-20(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) or C18 reversed-phase silica gel(particle size 40−65 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich). Normal-phase silica gel GTLC plates (w/UV 254) and reversed-phase C18 TLC plates (w/UV254) (Sorbent Technologies) were used for fraction detection. Thespots were visualized using UV light at 254 nm and spraying with 10%EtOH−sulfuric acid reagent. Semipreparative HPLC was performedon an Agilent 1200 unit equipped with a DAD detector, utilizing aLichrospher RP-18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm).Plant Material. Fresh aerial parts of the plant P. longifolia werecollected from the Kanopolis wildlife area (latitude: 38.74206°;longitude: 97.98467°), Ellsworth County, Kansas, USA, in August2009. It was identified by plant taxonomist Dr. Kelly Kindscher at theKansas Biological Survey, University of Kansas. A voucher specimen(Hillary Loring 3583) was deposited in the R.L. McGregor Herbariumof the University of Kansas.Extraction and Isolation. The collected biomass was air-dried atroom temperature. The dried material was then ground to a coarsepowder (930 g) and extracted three times with CH2Cl2−MeOH (50:50,4.0 L) at room temperature. After removing the solvents under vacuum,the extract (107 g) was suspended in 400 mL of H2O, followed bypartitions with n-hexane, EtOAc, and n-butanol (3 × 500 mL). Theresulting ethyl acetate fraction (22 g) collected was applied to silica gelflash CC (column chromatography) and eluted subsequently withhexane−acetone mixtures of increasing polarities. The fraction obtainedon elution with hexane−acetone (80:20) (1.0 g) was again subjected tosilica gel CC [eluted with CH2Cl2−CH3COCH3 (90:10)] to affordcompound 2 (280 mg). The fraction (3.0 g) obtained on elution withhexane−acetone (70:30) was subjected to silica gel CC [eluted withCH2Cl2−CH3COCH3 (80:20)] to yield compounds 16 (730 mg), 17(7 mg), and 20 (10 mg). The fraction (700 mg) obtained on elutionwith hexane−acetone (65:35) was subjected further to silica gel CC[eluted with hexane−acetone (65:35)] to afford compounds 3 (30 mg)and 5 (5 mg). The fraction (2.2 g) acquired on elution with hexane−acetone (60:40) was applied to silica gel CC [eluted with hexane−acetone (60:40)] to afford compounds 1 (1200 mg) and 4 (15 mg).The n-butanol fraction (29 g) obtained was subjected to a MCICHP20P gel CC (500 g) eluted with a mixture of H2O−MeOH (100:0,80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 85:15, 0:100), in order of increasing concentrationsof methanol. The 85% MeOH fraction (3.5 g) was subjected to silica gelCC, eluted with CH2Cl2−CH3COCH3 with increasing amounts ofacetone to afford compounds 1 (240 mg), 6 (40 mg), 16 (200 mg), 18(250 mg), and 21 (220 mg). The 60% MeOH fraction (4.2 g) wassubjected to silica gel CC, eluted with CH2Cl2−MeOH-H2O (7:1:0.1)with increasing amounts of MeOH−H2O (10:1). Then the fractionswere further subjected to reversed-phase C18 Si gel columnchromatography (200 g, particle size 40−63 μm), eluted by MeOH−H2O (40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 65:35). The fractions obtained weresubjected to semipreparative HPLC, with the mobile phase CH3CN−H2O (26:74; 28:72), to afford compounds 7 (40 mg), 8 (35 mg), 9 (9mg), 10 (12 mg), 11 (6 mg), 12 (5 mg), 13 (6 mg), 14 (7 mg), 15 (22mg), 19 (35 mg), and 22 (80 mg).Table 6.
