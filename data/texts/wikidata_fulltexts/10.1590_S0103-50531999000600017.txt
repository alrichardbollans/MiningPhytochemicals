Neste trabalho é descrita a identificação de alguns constituintes químicos minoritários da
“espinheira santa” (Maytenus ilicifolia e Maytenus aquifolium, Celastraceae), planta medicinal
amplamente utilizada no Brasil. Através do acoplamento entre cromatografia gasosa de alta
resolução e espectrometria de massas (HRGC-MS), foi possível identificar principalmente triter-
penóides e esteróides presentes na “espinheira santa”, vários dos quais relatados pela primeira vez
em ambas as espécies de Maytenus.
This work describes the identification of some of the minor chemical constituents of “espinheira
santa” (Maytenus ilicifolia and Maytenus aquifolium, Celastraceae), a medicinal plant widely
utilized in Brazil. By using high resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(HRGC-MS), it was possible to identify mainly triterpenoids and steroids in “espinheira santa”,
most of them reported for the first time in both Maytenus species.
Keywords: Maytenus aquifolium Martius, Maytenus ilicifolia Martius, gas chromatogra-

Introduction
“Espinheira santa” is the popular name of two species,
Maytenus aquifolium Martius and Maytenus ilicifolia Mar-
tius (Celastraceae). These medicinal plants are also known
as “cancorosa”, “cancerosa”, “salva-vidas”, “sombra de
touro”, “espinho de Deus” and others1, and are found in
Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia. In Brazil
their utilization is mainly in stomach ulcers and gastritis
treatment, due to the presence of both triterpenes friedelan-
3-ol and friedelin as well as polyphenolic compounds2,3. In
Paraguay and Bolivia, they are utilized by indian tribes and
rural populations as a fertility regulating agent4, due to the
alkaloid maytensine5.
Previous work showed by HRGC-FID (high resolution
gas chromatography - flame ionization detector) the pre-
dominance of friedeline and friedelan-3-ol in terpene frac-
tion from Maytenus ilicifolia and Maytenus aquifolium
leaves2,3, which indicates that these compounds may hide
minor terpenes in conventional phytochemical study (ex-
traction of plant material followed by purification of each
individual compound, for spectroscopic and spectrometric
analysis).
In this work, the characterization of further triterpenes
from the extracts obtained by direct extraction with ethyl
acetate from these two Maytenus species was done by
HRGC-MS (high resolution gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry), by MS fragmentation data acquisition both
by SCAN and SIM mode. In the first, the mass/charge ratio
scanning was changed, and in the latter the characteristic
terpenoid ions were monitored, followed by molecular ion
selective monitoring.
Experimental
Plant material
Leaves of Maytenus aquifolium Martius and M. ilicifo-
lia Martius (Celastraceae) were furnished by Ana Maria
Soares Pereira, UNAERP, Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil. The
leaves were dried (ca. 40 °C, forced ventilation, 3 days),
ground and sieved. Only plant material between 0.5-
1.0 mm was utilized.
Extraction of plant material
3 g of “espinheira santa” dried leaves were extracted
with ethyl acetate during 15 min at 40 °C (30 mL, three
times). After filtration, the acidic compounds were ex-
tracted with aqueous KOH 5% (10 mL, three times) fol-
lowed by the extraction of the basic compounds with
aqueous HCl 5% (10 mL, three times). The organic fraction,

which contained the neutral compounds, was washed with
30 mL of water and concentrated in a rotatory evaporator
to 30 mL, being then centrifuged during 10 min at 6000
rpm, to remove the suspended particles. The solvent was
evaporated to dryness, giving a residue, which was dis-
solved in CHCl3 for GC-MS analysis. Figure 1 summarizes
the procedure of the extraction process.
Chromatographic analysis
HRGC-MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-
Packard 5890 gas chromatograph, with a split injector
(1:50) at 280 °C and a Hewlett-Packard 5970 mass selective
detector (MSD), with the GC-MS interface temperature at
280 °C. The injection volume was 2 µL. Hydrogen was
employed as carrier gas, at a pressure of 60 kPa. A HP-1 25
m x 0.25 mm x 0.33 µm methylpolysiloxane cross-linked
capillary column was employed with temperature program-
ming from 100 °C (held for 2 min) to 280 °C (held for 30
min) at a ratio of 4 °C/min.
Results and Discussions
Figures 2 and 3 show the total ion chromatograms (TIC)
of the leaves extracts obtained with ethyl acetate from
Maytenus aquifolium and Maytenus ilicifolia, respectively.
The chromatographic profile was similar for both species,
differing only in the relative concentration of some com-
pounds; this similarity had been observed in HRGC-FID
analysis2. Most of the extracted compounds had retention
times between 36 and 56 min and were identified as being
terpenoids.
For the characterization of the compounds detected in
TIC/HRGC-MS, a process which increased the confidence
of the identification of compounds by the mass spectrome-
try was applied. Firstly, the fragmentogram obtained for
each compound was compared with the fragmentation data
base of the mass spectrometer, for obtaining a list of the 10
most probable substances (tentative identification). Sweep-

ing was done by using the SCAN mode, in which the values
of m/z between 50 and 480 daltons were chosen. It was
observed that, at the beginning of each probable fragmen-
togram, that the fragments of the compounds with tR 40 to
56 min had the same fragmentation between 50 and 120
daltons, and that differences appeared only after 120 dal-
tons.
The samples were analyzed again using the SCAN
mode, but with the sweeping range set between m/z 120 and
550. In this new sweeping, several fragments that showed
lower intensity (5 to 10% abundance) and have not been
useful for comparation with standards library data, turned
to 100% abundance, therefore participating in the compari-
son with NBS library (around 40,000 compounds). This
provided alternatives for the more probable compounds,
with a higher “match quality” score for the analyzed com-
pounds.
The MS data of the compounds found in Maytenus
samples were studied by comparison with the “Eight Peak
Index” data6. This allowed the conclusion that, within the
retention timespan from 40 to 50 min, most of the com-
pounds belonged to the terpenoids class. Thereafter, the
SIM mode (selective ion monitoring) was utilized for moni-
toring the terpenoids characteristic ions. Table 1 reports the
monitored ions for some pentacyclic terpenoids, as indi-
cated by Djerassis data concerning terpenoid fragmenta-
tions7.
The suggested method was checked by the confirma-
tion of the identity of some proposed structures through
the injection of authentic standards. Table 2 gives the
retention times and molecular ion obtained for those
standards.
Combining chromatographic and MS data, the latter
including search against terpenoids (2,515 compounds)
and standards (9 compounds, listed at Table 2) libraries,
14 compounds were identified in both Maytenus extracts,
including 7 substances which identity was also con-
firmed by direct comparison with standards: friedelin,
friedelan-3-ol, α-tocopherol, simiarenol, lupeol, lu-
penone, β-amyrin, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, cam-
pesterol, ergosterol, brassicasterol, squalene, and
hexadecanoic acid. Two additional peaks were partially
identified as tocopherol isomers (see captions of Figs. 2
and 3). The elution sequence of the triterpenoids was
coherent with previous GC-MS data of these compounds
in other plant extracts2,8.
Conclusions
The utilization of mass spectrometry was effective for
the identification of the minor terpenoids from Maytenus
ilicifolia and Maytenus aquifolium. Most of these com-
pounds are reported for the first time in these Maytenus
species. Their low concentration in plant material and the
similarity of skeletons justify the fact that these compounds
were not previously reported in conventional phytochemi-
cal studies of Maytenus ilicifolia or Maytenus aquifolium9.
The importance of the study of terpenoids is due to the
biological activity of some of these compounds. In the case
of “espinheira santa”, the major triterpenoids friedelan-3-ol
and friedelin were shown9 to be related to activity against
stomach ulcers and gastritis. The present study, which
reveals the complexity of the terpenoidal fraction of “espin-
heira santa”, suggest that the relative contribution of the
minor components on the pharmacological activity should
be evaluated.
