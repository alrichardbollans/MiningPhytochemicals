Antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content and flavonoid glycosides profile were compared in C.
album samples grown in intensively cultivated (IC) and nondisturbed (ND) soils to evaluate differences
in their nutraceutical potential. Petroleum ether, methanol, and aqueous extracts were sequentially
obtained from C. album dried samples. Methanol crude extract exhibited the highest antioxidant
potential and phenolic content, which were significantly enhanced by soil deterioration. This feature
was enhanced in its ethyl acetate/n-buthanol subextract that also yielded higher amounts of the fraction
containing flavonoid glycosides in samples grown in IC soils. Compounds were isolated by activity-
guided fractionation, and chemical structure-antioxidant activity relationships were established.
Chemical structures were elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic methods. Six known flavonoid
glycosides were isolated, and their antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH assay. 1, quercetin-
3-O-(2′′,6′′-di-O-R-L-rhamnopyranosyl)--D-glucopyranoside; 2, kaempferol-3-O-(2′′,6′′-di-O-R-L-rham-
nopyranosyl)--D-glucopyranoside; 3, quercetin-3-O--D-glucopyranosyl-(1′′′f6′′)--D-glucopyranoside;
4, rutin; 5, quercetin-3-O--D-glucopyranoside; and 6, kaempferol-3-O--D-glucopyranoside. Triosides
1 and 2 were identified for the first time in C. album. Our results suggest that this edible weed,
ubiquitously present in cultivated fields, should be considered as a nutraceutical food and an alternative
source for nutrients and free radical scavenging compounds, particularly when collected from cultivated
fields that seem to increase some of its advantages.

1. INTRODUCTION
Free radicals such as superoxide anions (O•2-), hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) can trigger
reactions damaging essential biomolecules in living organisms
such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Diabetes and
degenerative diseases, cancer, heart and vascular diseases,
neurological, and ocular disorders, besides the aging process
itself, are some of the consequences of their action (1, 2). They
also represent a problem in processed food affecting their
quality, stability, and safety (3). Antioxidants, either as nutra-
ceuticals, pharmaceutical supplements, or as food additives, can
terminate radical reactions. Current concerns about potential
mutagenic activity and possible carcinogenic effects of synthetic
antioxidants, such as buthylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and
buthylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), have encouraged the search
for naturally occurring antioxidants (4, 5).
Plants produce a diversity of chemical structures by biosynthetic
processes that have been modulated through genetic effects over
time in order to ensure their success in ecosystems. Among them,
flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and vitamins are compounds
with free radical scavenging properties. Polyphenols and particu-
larly flavonoid derivatives behave as reducing agents, mostly
donating hydrogen and quenching singlet oxygen. They seem to
have additive effects on endogenous scavenging compounds (6).
Flavonoids are versatile bioactive secondary metabolites present
in almost all plant species. Most representative family members
include flavones, flavanes, flavonols, catechins, and anthocyanidins.
Their antioxidant potential toward ROS depends on structural
characteristics such as the number and substitution pattern of
hydroxyl groups and the extent at which these groups are
glycosilated (7).
Many edible fruits and vegetables contain free radical
inhibitors with preventive potential regarding a large number
of human diseases that have been defined as nutraceuticals (8).
However, many other natural sources such as edible weeds have
not been used yet with this purpose, even when they have been
known by ancient civilizations and used as a part of their daily

diet. Stephen De Felice coined the term nutraceutical in 1989
(9) to define a food (or a food component) providing medical
or health benefits, including prevention and/or treatment of
diseases (8). Even when weeds are considered to be a problem
in agriculture, from the productivity stand point, it is possible
to take advantage of them as alternative vegetables in foods or
as a renewable resource to obtain nutraceuticals or other
bioactive principles.
White quinoa, Chenopodium album (Chenopodiaceae), is a
broadleaf weed species called fat hen in Europe and lambs-
quarters in United States of America. It has developed cross-
and multiple resistance to synthetic herbicides, and still causes
significant economic losses in agriculture all over the world (10).
Having nutritional values, its leaves have been consumed raw
in salads or cooked by different civilizations in America and
are still part of human diet in Mexico and other developing
countries. C. album leaves are rich in proteins (4.2%) with a
high proportion of essential aminoacids such as lysine, leucine,
and isoleucine, and significant amounts of calcium and vitamins
A (11000 IU/100 g) and C (80 mg/100 g) (11).
Cinnamic acids amides (12), flavonoids (13, 14), and apoc-
arotenoids (15) have also been isolated from this species.
Environmental conditions, including biotic and abiotic factors,
modulate the rate at which primary and secondary metabolisms
occur (16). Stresses such as drought, extreme temperatures, low
soil quality, and/or the presence of herbicides and pathogens
are now common features in intensively cultivated agroecosys-
tems, with direct consequences in the proportion at which
particular secondary metabolites are produced. It has been shown
that different kinds of stresses enhance secondary metabolism
pathways related to chemical defense strategies (16). Changes
in environmental conditions particularly in soil quality can
trigger variations on secondary metabolites production. In a
previous work (17), it was reported that C. album samples grown
in Argentina in intensively cultivated soils produced larger
amounts of nonpolar compounds such as long chain linear and
branched hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, and long chain alcohols
and aldehydes. The aim of this work was to study the free radical
scavenging ability and flavonoid contents in plant samples grown
under the same conditions. Extracts and subextracts from C.
album aerial parts were studied in relation to the quality of the
soil where the samples were grown in order to separate and
identify the corresponding bioactive compounds. A literature
survey revealed no previous references on the antioxidant
potential of this weed. Nevertheless, flavonol glycosides with
antioxidant activity were isolated from seeds of another species
within this genus, Chenopodium quinoa, considered a pseudoce-
real in Latin America (18).
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. General Methods. Analytical and spectroscopy degree solvents
were purchased from Sintorgan (Chemical Center SRL, Argentine).
Kieselgel 60 F254 TLC aluminum sheets for thin layer chromatography
were purchased from Merck (Research AG, Buenos Aires, Argentina).
Sephadex LH-20 for column chromatography was purchased from
Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co., Ltd., Germany.
Chemical standards and reagents, such as DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-
picryl-hydrazyl), Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 2,6-dichloroquinone-4-chlo-
rimide, quercetin, ascorbic acid, BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), and
chlorogenic acid hemihydrate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich S.A.
(Buenos Aires, Argentina).
Column chromatography was performed on Sephadex LH-20, using
a glass column (60 cm × 4.5 cm id).
HPLC analysis was performed in a SP liquid chromatograph
equipped with a Spectra Series P100 solvent delivery system, Rheodyne
manual injector, and UV micrometrics Mod 787 detector using a 5
µm-Bondapak C-18 column (5 µm, 30 cm × 7.8 mm id) from Waters
Corp., MA, USA.
A Hewlett-Packard 5890A Gas Chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard,
Avondale, PA, USA), equipped with a flame-ionization detector was
used to analyze peracetylated alditols, with a GC column: SP-2330
(25 m × 0.2 mm id).
IR spectra were recorded on a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Magna-
550 Series II, Midac, Co., USA).
1H- and 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 500 and 125 MHz,
respectively, on a Bruker AM 500 Spectrometer (Bruker, Germany).
Chemical shifts (δ) were determined in CD3OD and expressed in ppm.
13C NMR multiplicity was established by DEPT.
2.2. Plant Material. Chenopodium album samples were collected
at their vegetative stage, during summer time, from fields in the maize
production area of Argentina (32-35° S and 58-62° W), characterized
by silty clay loam soil. Plant samples were collected from four fields
with a long cropping history (more than 15 years since last pasture)
exhibiting low stability indexes (less than 20%) (19). Samples with
similar height were chosen at random within each field from two kinds
of sites: (i) intensively cultivated (IC) and (ii) nondisturbed (ND). In
most cropping fields, there is an area surrounding cultivated soil that
remains without being disturbed by human activity. ND samples were
collected from noncultivated areas at the edge of each field, where soil
is not disturbed. These intensively cultivated and nondisturbed soils
were previously classified as deteriorated and nondeteriorated, on the
basis of their chemical and physical properties (20).
IC and ND samples were collected the same day from each field,
under identical environmental conditions, with the exception of soil
exploitation level.
A voucher specimen of each sample was deposited (no. 24038) in
the Botany Herbarium of the Agronomy School, University of Buenos
Aires.
2.3. Extraction and Isolation. C. album aerial parts were separated
from roots and immediately submitted to drying conditions at 40 °C
under ventilation. Dry material was milled and continuously extracted
in a Soxhlet device with light petroleum ether to separate lipidic
components and then with methanol. The remaining plant residue was
finally extracted with distilled water overnight at room temperature.
Organic extracts were evaporated to dryness under vacuum conditions,
while the aqueous extract was lyophilized. All of them were tested on
their antioxidant potential by DPPH assay. Methanol crude extract,
which showed the highest free radical scavenging activity, was further
processed in order to separate active compounds by polarity.
C. album methanol extract was dissolved in distilled water,
partitioned with chloroform (3×) and further extracted with ethyl
acetate/n-butanol (1:1) (EtOAc/n-BuOH) (3×). Organic layers were
evaporated to dryness under vacuum. EtOAc/n-BuOH fraction, the
subextract with higher antioxidant activity, was further purified by
column chromatography through Sephadex LH-20 using MeOH/H2O
(2:1) as eluent. Fractions (9 mL) were collected and analyzed by
chromatography on Kieselgel 60 F254 TLC aluminum sheets with
n-BuOH/AcOH/H2O (12:3:5) as mobile phase in order to characterize
those enriched in flavonoid derivatives. Chromatograms were visualized
by UV-light and/or by reaction with Gibbs reagent (2,6-dichloro-
quinone-4-chlorimide in chloroform (2%)). After spraying with Gibbs
reagent, TLC sheets were placed in a chamber saturated with ammonia
fumes and then heated at 120 °C for 5 min. Fractions showing positive
reactions were joint and evaporated together to give a flavonoid enriched
extract (F), which was further chromatographed by reverse-phase
HPLC.
2.4. Comparative HPLC. C. album flavonoid enriched extract F
was dissolved in methanol (100 µg mL-l) and 1 µL of each solution
(corresponding to FIC and FND repetitions) was analyzed by RP-HPLC,
eluting with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (23:77:1, v/v/v) at a flow rate
1.0 mL min-l, with UV detection at λ 350 nm.
2.5. Identification of Flavonoid Glycosides. RP-HPLC was further
performed to isolate flavonoid glycosides, under the conditions
established in the previous paragraph. Structures were elucidated by
chemical and spectroscopic methods and confirmed by comparison with
literature data. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD.

2.6. Acid Hydrolysis of Glycosides: Monosaccharide Composi-
tion. Acid hydrolysis of purified flavonoid glycosides was performed
in order to establish monosaccharide composition, as previously reported
(21). Each pure glycoside (1-2 mg) was heated in a screw cap vial
with 2 N trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 mL) at 120 °C for 1 h. The aglycone
was extracted with CHCl3, and the remaining aqueous solution was
evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting sugar mixture was
treated with 0.5 M NH3 (0.5 mL) and NaBH4 (2 mg) at room
temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was first acidified with 1
M AcOH (pH 5-6), and then MeOH (0.5 mL) was added. The solution
was evaporated in vacuo to obtain the alditol mixture, which was
peracetylated with Ac2O (0.5 mL) in pyridine (0.5 mL) at 100 °C for
45 min, cooled, and poured into CHCl3/H2O (1:1). Aqueous phase was
extracted with CHCl3 (3 × 0.5 mL). Chloroform extract was sequen-
tially washed with distilled water (0.5 mL), NaHCO3 saturated solution
(0.5 mL), again with distilled water (0.5 mL), and evaporated to dryness
under nitrogen. Peracetylated alditols were analyzed by GC (SP-2330
column; nitrogen as gas carrier; temperature range, 200-230 °C; rate,
2 °C min-1). Standard peracetylated alditols were used as reference
compounds.
2.7. Total Phenolic Content. Total phenolic content of C. album
extracts and fractions was evaluated by means of the Folin-Ciocalteau
reagent, using chlorogenic acid as standard (22). The sample solution (10
µL) containing 100 µg extract was poured into a volumetric flask, which
was thoroughly shaken for 3 min, after adding distilled water (4.6 mL)
and Folin-Ciocalteau reagent (0.1 mL). 2% Na2CO3 solution (0.3 mL)
was then added, and the mixture was submitted to intermittent shaking
for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 760 nm. These determinations were
carried out per triplicate, and mean values were calculated. The same
procedure was repeated with standard chlorogenic acid solutions (0-100
µg mL-1) in order to obtain a standard curve.
2.8. Antioxidant Activity. DPPH Spectrophotometric Assay. The
free radical scavenging potential of extracts, subextracts, and pure
compounds was confirmed by spectrophotometric assay, quantifying
their capacity to bleach a purple solution of DPPH in methanol (23).
Different concentrations of their methanol solutions (50 µL) were added
to 0.004% DPPH methanol solution (5 mL). After a 30 min incubation
period at room temperature, each absorbance (A) was determined at
517 nm. Inhibition percentage of DPPH (I %) was calculated as follows:
I % ) (Acontrol -Asample ⁄ Acontrol) × 100
where Acontrol is the absorbance of a control solution containing only
the reagents, and Asample is the absorbance of the corresponding sample
reaction. The effective dose responsible of 50% inhibition (ED50) was
obtained from a plot of inhibition percentage versus extract concentra-
tion. These determinations were carried out in triplicate, and mean
values were calculated. BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and ascorbic
acid were used as positive controls.
2.9. Statistical Analysis. Data is reported as mean values ( standard
deviation of four independent extractions, and activity measurements
were done in triplicate. Analysis of variance was performed for all data
using the General Linear Model. Mean values were compared by least
significant difference (LSD) at 0.05 probability level.
3. RESULTS
Stress conditions often enhance secondary metabolite produc-
tion, and among them, that of free radical scavenging com-
pounds. We found that soil deterioration increases flavonoid
content in C. album, particularly those derivatives related to
quercetin, also diminishing its glycosilation degree.
C. album samples collected from intensively cultivated (IC)
and nondisturbed (ND) soils were sequentially extracted with
petroleum ether (E), methanol (M), and distilled water (A). The
corresponding TLC chromatograms stained with Gibbs reagent
showed significant amounts of phenolic compounds in methanol
and aqueous extracts. C. album methanol crude extract (M)
exhibited the highest antioxidant potential. Its TLC chromato-
gram showed various radical scavenging compounds as light
yellow spots on a violet background, even at the lowest
concentration (0.10 mg mL-l). Crude extracts (1000 µg mL-l)
were also compared in their antioxidant potential by DPPH
spectrophotometric assay, a fast method to detect free radical
scavenging compounds. Figure 1 shows higher DPPH inhibition
percentage values for both A and M extracts, also identifying
the latter as the only one with significant activity enhancement
when obtained from samples grown in intensively cultivated
soils.
3.1. Free Radical Scavenging Activity and Total Phenolic
Content. Methanol crude extract from samples grown in IC
soils (MIC) showed free radical scavenging activity 37% higher
than MND, with DPPH ED50 values of 122.3 and 167.0 µg mL-l,
respectively. Since M activity was the only one exhibiting a
significant increment in samples from intensively cultivated
soils, this extract was further submitted to fractionation as
indicated in Figure 2. Its aqueous solution was extracted first
with chloroform and then with EtOAc/n-BuOH (1:1). When
staining the TLC subextracts chromatogram, it was found that
free radical scavenging substances included in the latter reacted
much faster with DPPH than those in the chloroform subextract.
EtOAc/n-BuOH subextract exhibited the highest antioxidant
activity, which was also significantly enhanced by soil deteriora-
tion. These results were further confirmed by spectrophotometric
analysis.
Total phenolic content was evaluated in extracts and subex-
tracts by the Folin-Cicolteau modified method (22), which
expresses data in terms of chlorogenic acid µmol (CA) mg-l
dry extract. Only EtOAc/n-BuOH subextract, with the highest
phenolic content, showed significant increments in samples from
intensively cultivated soils (IC, 0.75 ( 0.17; and ND, 0.52 (
0.10) (Table 1). Free radical scavenging capacity was directly
correlated with total phenolic content, with correlation coef-
ficients of -0.9872 and -0.8097 for IC and ND samples,

respectively. Free radical scavenging activity of extracts,
subextracts, and compounds by DPPH assay, and total phenolic
content are shown in Table 1.
The EtOAc/n-BuOH subextract obtained from MIC was
almost three times more active toward DPPH (ED50: 22.47 µg
mL-l) than the corresponding MND subextract (ED50: 87.80 µg
mL-l), showing almost half-of the BHT free radical scavenging
potential.
EtOAc/n-BuOH subextracts were further fractionated by
column chromatography with Sephadex LH-20 to give flavonoid
glycosides enriched fractions (F) (Figure 2). Starting from the
same amount of dry plant material, the FIC mean value (1.63 g)
resulted twice as much as FND mean value (0.81 g). These
fractions were submitted to RP-HPLC to obtain glycoside
relative abundances (Table 2).
3.2. Comparative HPLC. C. album flavonoid glycoside
fraction F was dissolved in methanol (100 µg mL-l) and
submitted to RP-HPLC with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (23:
77:1, v/v/v) as eluent and UV detection at λ ) 350 nm. HPLC
chromatograms showed signals at retention time (Rt) values
within 0.72-5.36 min.
Six flavonoid derivatives were further identified as glycosides
1-6 (Figure 4). The signal at 4.03 min exhibited the highest
abundance difference between samples from IC and ND soils.
Triosides 1 (0.77 min) and 2 (1.69 min) were eluted first, while
both monosides 5 (5.05 min) and 6 (5.36 min) were the latter.
With similar oligosaccharide chains, quercetin trioside (1) eluted
prior to kaempferol trioside (2). Relative abundances of gly-
cosides in FIC and FND HPLC chromatograms are presented in
Table 2.
Higher abundances of diosides (3 + 4), rutin being one of
them, were also found in FIC (32.11%) compared to those in
FND (17.62%). Total triosides abundance percentage in F was
lower under stress conditions related to soil deterioration.
Both triosides 1 and 2, which represented 33.80% of FND,
were less abundant in FIC (23.44%). Quercetin derivative 1
was responsible for it since there were no significant
differences in the amount of kaempferol trioside 2.
Monosides 5 and 6 were minor components in samples
from IC and ND soils, nevertheless the relative amount of
quercetin derivative (5) in samples grown in IC soils (3.42%)
was more than twice as much its value in samples from ND
soils (1.62%). Even when the relative abundance of kaempfer-
ol monoside decreased 11% as a result of low soil quality,
the total amount of monosides was enhanced 33% because
quercetin monoside (5) abundance was increased more than
100%.
3.3. Isolation and Identification of Flavonoid Glycosides.
Six pure known compounds 1-6 were isolated by RP-HPLC

(Figure 3). All compounds showed free radical scavenging
activity, and two of them (1 and 2) are reported for the first
time in C. album.
Compounds were isolated as light- or dark-yellow amor-
phous powders. Structures were determined by chemical and
spectroscopic methods, and identified by direct comparison
of their physical properties with those previously reported.
Compound (1-6) IR spectra showed bands at 1650 and 3380
(cm-1), which were consistent with carbonyl and hydroxyl
groups. 1H and 13C NMR, and DEPT spectra of isolated
glycosides exhibited chemical shifts and coupling constants
corresponding to quercetin (1, 3, 4, and 5) and kaempferol
(2 and 6).
Monosaccharide composition of sugar moieties was deter-
mined by hydrolysis with aqueous 2 N trifluoroacetic acid
followed by GC analysis of the corresponding peracetylated
alditols.
-anomeric configuration for glucose and R-anomeric
configuration for rhamnose were suggested by its large JH1,H2
coupling constants at 7.4-7.7 Hz and 1.5-1.7 Hz, respec-
tively (24). All isolated compounds were glycosilated at C-3
in agreement with literature data (14, 25–27).

DISCUSSION
EtOAc/BuOH subextract as well as flavonoid derivatives
isolated from C. album showed a concentration-dependent
antiradical activity. Rutin (4), the most abundant glycoside in
C. album, exhibited a very high DPPH scavenging activity, with
an ED50 value of 4.90 µg mL-l. Triosides 1 and 2, which are
less active, showed ED50 values of 6.50 and 6.90 µg mL-l,

respectively, both with free radical scavenging potential higher
than that of BHT (ED 50: 10.8 µg mL-l) (Table 1). All isolated
compounds showed lower antioxidant activity than quercetin
(ED50: 2.63 µg mL-l) and similar to that exhibited by ascorbic
acid (ED50: 5.94 µg mL-l). Lower antioxidant activities were
observed for kaempferol glycosides 2 and 6. Quercetin glyco-
sides were more active than the corresponding kaempferol
derivatives, and all of them exhibited higher activity than the
synthetic antioxidant BHT.
Flavonoid antioxidant activity has been studied by numerous
authors, and many attempts have been made to establish a
relationship between their structure and radical-scavenging
potential (28, 29, 7). Radical scavenging activity depends on
flavonoid molecular structure and particularly on hydroxyl group
substitution pattern. A structural feature considered essential for
it is the presence of an o-dihydroxy group (catechol structure)
in the B ring, with electron donating properties. The presence
of a hydroxyl group at C-3 in the C ring increases the antioxidant
potential of flavonoids, and the R- unsaturated carbonyl group
also enhances the radical scavenging capacity of these com-
pounds. Its simultaneous occurrence with hydroxyl groups at
C-3 and C-5 contributes to the increase their potential as
antioxidants (7, 30).
Sugar chain attachment occurring at C-3 (compounds 1-6)
seems to attenuate the free radical scavenging potential of
aglycone. Since the flavonoid moiety is responsible for the
free radical scavenging potential of these glycosides, its
glycosilation, which increases their molecular weight, also
contributes to lower the corresponding antioxidant activity.
C. album flavonoids increased their level in samples
growing in continuously cultivated soils, particularly in their
methanol extract. Even when similar amounts of this extract
were obtained from samples collected in IC and ND soils,
they exhibited significant differences in their antioxidant
activity. Higher concentrations of flavonoid derivatives, in
addition to C. album nutritional features, enhance the
nutraceutical value of this edible weed when grown in IC
soils.
Synthetic antioxidants demonstrated to be dangerous to human
health, encouraging the search for naturally occurring antioxi-
dants and flavonoids, are a group of natural products playing
this role in plants. Species such as common weeds with
nutritional quality are potential sources to find them. Current
concerns about aging and diseases triggered by free radical
action have also encouraged the addition of vegetables with
significant amounts of flavonoids to the human diet. Numerous
epidemiological studies demonstrated inverse associations be-
tween fruit and vegetable intake, and chronic diseases such as
cancer and cardiovascular problems. Flavonoid derivatives,
among other natural antioxidants, had been recognized as
responsible for this protective effect. Our results suggest that
C. album, an ethnic food containing important amounts of them,
could be considered a functional food, particularly when growing
in intensively cultivated soils. Flavonoid content was duplicated
by soil deterioration, a common feature in most cropping lands.
We also found that total phenolic content as much as the free
radical scavenging potential is related to the relative amount of
flavonoid glycosides in C. album samples, facts that characterize
this edible weed as a potential renewable resource for obtaining
natural antioxidants.
