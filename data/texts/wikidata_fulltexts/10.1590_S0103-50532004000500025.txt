Das folhas de Guarea kunthiana foram obtidos um novo diterpeno com esqueleto do tipo
caurano (ent-caur-16-eno-2-ona), além de oito diterpenos (ent-caur-16-eno, ent-3α- e 3β-hidroxicaur-
16-eno, kolavelool, kolavenol, kolavenal, ent-13-epi-óxido de manoíla e (-)-neftenol), quatro
sesquiterpenos (alismol, alismóxido, espatulenol e 4β,10α-aromadendranodiol), poliprenol-12 e α-
e δ-tocoferóis. Kolavenal está sendo relatado pela primeira vez como produto natural, assim como a
ocorrência de diterpenos do tipo cembrano e ent-caurano na família Meliaceae.
From leaves of Guarea kunthiana one new kaurene diterpene (ent-kaur-16-en-2-one) was
isolated along with eight known diterpenes (ent-kaur-16-ene, ent-3α- and 3β-hydroxykaur-16-ene,
kolavelool, kolavenol, kolavenal, ent-13-epi-manoyloxide and (-)-nephthenol), four sesquiterpenes
(alismol, alismoxide, spathulenol and 4β,10α-aromadendranediol), polyprenol-12 and α- and δ-
tocopherols. Kolavenal is reported for the first time as a natural product, as well as the occurrence of
cembrane- and ent-kaurane-type diterpenes in the Meliaceae.
Keywords: Guarea kunthiana, Meliaceae, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, ent-kaur-16-en-2-one
Introduction
In our continuing interest on the chemical constituents
of plants of the Meliaceae family which are widely
distributed in the central-western region of Brazil1 we have
investigated the leaves of Guarea kunthiana A. Juss. A
previous chemical study of the aerial parts of a specimen
of Guarea kunthiana found in Ecuador resulted in the
isolation of the limonoid ecuadorin.2 No limonoids were
detected in the leaves of the specimen investigated in the
present work which provided, on the other hand, one new,
ent-kaur-16-en-2-one (3) and three known, ent-kaur-16-
ene (1), ent-3β- and 3α-hydroxykaur-16-ene (2, 4)
kaurenoids, three known ent-clerodane diterpenes,
kolavelool (5), kolavenol (6) and kolavenal (7), the
cembranoid (-)-nephthenol (8) and ent-13-epi-
manoyloxide (9) in addition to four known sesquiterpenes,
spathulenol (10) alismol (11), alismoxide (12), and
(-)-4β,10α-aromadendranediol (13), polyprenol-12 (14)
and α- and δ-tocopherols (15, 16). Kolavenal has now been
reported for the first time from nature, while it was known
earlier as a derivative by synthesis from kolavenol.3
(-)-Nephthenol was previously obtained only from marine
organisms.4,5 These diterpenes and sesquiterpenes, except
for kolavelool and spathulenol, are described for the first
time in the Meliaceae.
Results and Discussion
A crude ethanol extract of the leaves of Guarea
kunthiana was partitioned between methanol-H2O (9:1)
and hexane. The hydromethanolic solution was further
partitioned with ethyl acetate. Compounds 1-10 and 14-
16 were isolated from the hexane soluble fraction while
compounds 11-13 and further amounts of 5, 6 and 10 were
obtained from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction, after a
combination of column chromatography on silica gel, gel
filtration and preparative TLC separations. The known
compounds were identified by comparison of their physical
and spectroscopic (IR, 1H and 13C NMR, MS) data with
those of authentic samples and/or reported in the literature.
Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be identical with
768 Garcez et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.
ent-kaur-16-ene and ent-3β-hydroxykaur-16-ene,
respectively, on the basis of their specific rotation and
spectral (1H, 13C NMR, MS) data, which in turn were in
accordance with those published.6-8 Although widely
distributed in a number of plants, no records related to the
isolation of kaurene-type diterpenes have hitherto been
reported in the Meliaceae.
The molecular formula of 3, obtained as an amorphous
solid, was established as C20H30O from HREIMS data ([M+]
m/z 286.2296). Its IR spectrum was consistent with the
presence of a carbonyl (1714 cm-1) and an exomethylene
(881 cm-1) group, while the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1),
displaying the characteristic pair of broad singlets due to
the exocyclic methylene group, was very similar to that of
1 (ent-kaur-16-ene). The only significant difference
referred to the presence of two double doublets at δ 2.50
(H-1
eq, J 12.6 and 1.9 Hz) and δ 2.15 (H-3eq, J 13.6 and 1.9
Hz) and two broad doublets at δ 1.90 (H-1
ax
, J 12.6 Hz) and
δ 2.24 (H-3
ax
, J 13.6 Hz). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1)
showed, in addition to the signals at δ 155.1 (C) and 103.4
(CH2) attributed to the exocyclic double bond at C-16 in a
kaurene skeleton, a ketone carbon signal at δ 212.0.
Accordingly, the molecular ion observed in the HREIMS
at m/z 286.2296 was 14 mass units higher than that of 1.
Comparison of 13C NMR data of 1 and 3 indicated that
they had identical constituting rings B, C and D, therefore
indicating that the carbonyl was located on the A ring of
compound 3. The deshielding of the A-ring methylene
carbons in 3 when compared to those of 1 (∆δ 14-15)

suggested that the carbonyl group was located at the C-2
position. This proposal was in agreement with the chemical
shifts and multiplicities of H-1 and H-3 as aforementioned.
Accordingly, the 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 3 showed the
geminal coupling between H-1
ax
 and H-1
eq as well as
between H-3
ax
 and H-3
eq. Likewise, this spectrum depicted
the long-range couplings between H-1
eq and H-3eq, H-1ax
and H-20 and H-3
ax
 and H-19. Unambiguous assignment
of H-1 and H-3 was also achieved by the long-range
correlations observed in the HMBC spectrum between
H-1 and C-9, C-10, C-20 and between H-3 and C-4, C-18
and C-19 (Table 1). On the other hand, the cross-peak
correlations in the HMQC spectrum of H-1 and H-3 with
the carbon signals at δ 56.1 and δ 56.3, respectively, as
well as the long range connectivities shown by the HMBC
spectrum between the signal ascribed to H-20 (δ 1.00) and
δ 56.1 and between H-18 (δ 1.03) and δ 56.3 confirmed
the assignments of C-1 and C-3, respectively. The
significant HMBC correlations noticed between the
signals of H-1 and H-3 and that of the carbonyl carbon
further supported the location of this group at C-2. The
remaining quaternary carbons in the structure of 3 were
assigned according to the 1H-13C long range correlation
data provided in Table 1. On the basis of its negative [α]D
value, it is suggested that 3 belongs to the ent series,
similarly to other analogous kaurenoid diterpenes.8,9 Thus
3 was characterized as ent-kaur-16-en-2-one.
Compound 4 which showed a molecular ion at m/z 288
in EIMS and a negative specific rotation value, was
assumed to be a C-3 epimeric derivative of 2 on the basis
of the close resemblance of their 1H and 13C NMR spectra,
except for the chemical shift and coupling constant of
H-3 and in some resonance values of A-ring carbons. In the
1H NMR spectrum of 4, a broad singlet at δ 3.39, instead of
a double doublet at δ 3.18 (J 10.2, 5.8 Hz) ascribed to H-3
in 2, determined the equatorial nature of H-3 and the
resulting axial orientation of the C-3 hydroxyl group. As
expected, an upfield shift of the C-3 resonance (δ 76.1)
was observed in 4 when compared to that of 2 (δ 79.1).
Likewise, the axial orientation of the hydroxyl accounted
for the γ-effect on C-1 and C-5 which were shielded by 5.4
and 6.2 ppm, respectively. Therefore, compound 4 was
determined to be ent-3α-hydroxy-kaur-16-ene, which is
described for the first time in the Meliaceae, yet previously
reported from Annona senegalensis (Annonaceae)10 and
as a reduction product of ent-kaur-16-en-3-one.7 Identity
was further confirmed by comparison with literature data
(1H and EIMS).7 The 13C NMR spectral data of 4, not
previously reported in literature, are now presented in Table
1. The unambiguous assignment of the carbon resonances
of 4, mainly those of C-18, C-19 and C-20 methyls, was
based on information provided by HMQC, HMBC and
NOESY experiments.
Diterpenes 5 and 6 were characterized as ent-clerodane
derivatives with a ∆3 double bond, in addition to a
hydroxyl group and a double bond in the C-9 side chain.
The optical rotation values and spectral characteristics (1H
and 13C NMR, MS and IR) of 5 and 6 agreed with those of
kolavelool8,11 and kolavenol,8,12 respectively. The first was
already obtained from Guarea trichilioides13 while
kolavenol was hitherto unreported in the Meliaceae.
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 6 and 7 were almost
identical, except for the presence of an aldehyde (δH 9.95 d,
7.6 Hz; δC 191.3) in 7 in place of the hydroxymethylene
group at C-15. The carbon resonances at δ 127.2 and 165.5
together with a carbonyl absorption band at 1675 cm-1 in the
IR spectrum also confirmed this assumption. Therefore
compound 7 was characterized as ent-(E)-cleroda-3,13-dien-
15-al whose spectroscopic properties (IR and 1H NMR) and
optical rotation value were very similar to those described for
kolavenal, a compound obtained by MnO2 oxidation of 6. 3
Thus compound 7 is reported for the first time as a genuine
natural product. Its 13C NMR data, not reported before now
and presented in Table 1, readily support the assignment of
the double bond configuration in the side chain as (E), on the
basis of the chemical shifts of C-12 (δ 34.4) and C-16 methyl
group (δ 17.8). In similar 13-en-15-al ent-clerodane
derivatives, e. g., 3R*,4R*-dihydroxyclerod-13E-en-15-al
and the corresponding (Z) isomer, the presence of a carbonyl
at C-15 accounts for the γ-effect observed at C-12 methylene
carbon in the (Z) isomer (δ 26.9) with respect to the
corresponding resonance in the (E) isomer (δ 34.5). On the
other hand, the same effect is observed at the C-16 methyl
group in the (E) isomer (δ 17.1) when compared to the
corresponding resonance of the (Z) isomer (δ 24.7).14
The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of compound 8, in
addition to the cross-peak correlations and the long-range
connectivities observed in the HMQC and HMBC spectra,
respectively, defined 8 as a carbomonocyclic diterpene of
the cembrane class, characterized as a cembra-3,7,11-
triene-15-ol. These results, together with the negative
optical rotation value of 8, agreed with those reported
earlier for (-)-nephthenol, (1R,3E,7E,11E)-cembra-3,7,11-
triene-15-ol. 4,8 The great majority of cembranoids of plant
origin occurs in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, Solanaceae)
and in Coniferae species, although they are widely
distributed in marine organisms and insects.5,8 However,
(-)-nephthenol was only described in marine invertebrates
(e.g. soft corals).4,5 Thus, this is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first report of the isolation of a cembrane-type
diterpene from Meliaceae, as well as of the occurrence of
(-)-nephthenol in a plant taxon.

The structure of 9 was shown to be of a labdane-type
diterpenoid from its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data, which
showed striking resemblance with those of (+)-13-epi-
manoyl oxide,15 a compound which differs from 9 by having
a specific rotation of opposite sign.15 The latter diterpene
was then characterized as ent-13-epi-manoyl oxide, which
was previously isolated from members of other plant
families, e.g. Cistaceae and Flacourtiaceae16 but, until now,
not yet reported in the Meliaceae.
The sesquiterpenes 10 - 12 obtained in the present work
were found to be identical in their spectral data with
spathulenol (data compared with those of an authentic
sample), alismol17,18 and alismoxide,17 respectively. Direct
comparison of the spectral data of 13 with those of 4β,10α-
aromadendranediol proved their identity.19,20 This
sesquiterpene was first isolated as the dextrorotatory isomer
from the soft coral Sinularia mayi 19 and later obtained in
the (-) form in only few plant species, e. g. Brasilia sickii.20
On the basis of the negative sign of the specific rotation of
13, its structure was therefore established as (-)-4β,10α-
aromadendranediol. Apart from 10, these sesquiterpenes
are described for the first time in the Meliaceae.
The polyprenol 14 was identified as ficaprenol-12 (also
known as polyprenol-12) by comparison of its 1H and 13C
NMR spectral data with literature.21 This compound, which
has been obtained from leaves of several angiosperms, was
also isolated from Guarea jamaicensis.22
Although members of the Meliaceae, including those
belonging to the genus Guarea that occur in Brazil, are
well-known for the occurrence of sesqui-, di-, tri- and
tetranortriterpenoids,1,13,23 the isolation for the first time of
cembranoid and kaurenoid diterpenes in this family is
noteworthy for its chemosystematic relevance. Also worthy
of mention is the fact that, unlike the specimen of G.
kunthiana found in Ecuador whose aerial parts yielded
one limonoid as the only natural compound, no limonoids
were detected in the leaves of the specimen collected in
Brazil and investigated in the present work.
Experimental
General experimental procedures
IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a Bomem-
Hartmann & Braun FT IR spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were measured on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer
at 300 MHz (1H) and 75 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 as a
solvent and internal reference. Standard pulse sequences
were used for homo - and heteronuclear correlation
experiments. EIMS data were obtained at 70 eV on a
Shimadzu QP-5000 (Departamento de Química, UFMS,
MS, Brazil) and on a HP 5973 MSD spectrometer (Instituto
de Química, UFBA, BA, Brazil). HREIMS data were
obtained at 70 eV on a VG Autospec spectrometer (Instituto
de Química, UNICAMP, SP, Brazil). Optical rotations were
determined on a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter (Na filter,
λ = 589 nm).
Plant material
The leaves of Guarea kunthiana A. Juss. were collected
in Campo Grande, MS, Brazil, in September 2000. The
plant material was identified by one of the authors (U.R.)
and Dr. Germano Guarin Neto (Universidade Federal de
Mato Grosso, MT, Brazil). Voucher specimens (11536) are
deposited at the CGMS Herbarium (UFMS), Campo
Grande, MS, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation
Air-dried and powdered leaves (1450 g) were extracted
at room temperature with EtOH. The residue obtained from
the EtOH extract was partitioned between MeOH-H2O 9:1
and hexane. The hydromethanolic solution was evaporated
in vacuo and after removal of MeOH the aqueous phase was
extracted with EtOAc. The hexane phase (59.5 g) was
subjected to CC (Silica gel, 70-230 mesh, 200 g, hexane-
CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2-EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH gradients) to
yield 19 fractions A→N (250 ml each). Fractions A and B
gave 1 (3.5 g). Fraction D (7.4 g) was further separated by
CC (Silica gel, 70-230 mesh, 115 g, hexane-CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2-
EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH gradients) and furnished 25
fractions. From these, fraction 8 consisted of 15 24 (3.6 mg)
while fraction 12 yielded after CC (Sephadex LH-20, 3x10
cm, hexane-CH2Cl2 1:1) followed by prep. TLC (hexane-
acetone 9:1) 5 (3.3 mg) and 14 (8.6 mg). Fraction E (7.6 g)
was subjected to CC (Sephadex LH-20, 3x50 cm, 10
portions of 0.76g each, CHCl3-MeOH 3:2). The fractions
showing similar spots by TLC were combined and the
residues from therein were subjected to rechromatography
(Silica gel, 230-400 mesh, 70 g, hexane-EtOAc gradient) to
give 3 (8.1 mg), 4 (44.2 mg), 5 (1.26 g), 6 (14.4 mg), 8 (75.0
mg), 9 (7.6 mg), 10 (21.4 mg), 16 24 (22.5 mg) and phytol
(22.5 mg). Fraction G (2.3 g) afforded, after CC (Sephadex
LH-20, 3x50 cm, CHCl3-MeOH 3:2) followed by a second
CC (Silica gel, 230-400 mesh, 70 g, hexane-acetone
gradient) 2 (10.1 mg), 6 (16.1 mg) and 7 (4.7 mg). Further
amounts of 6 (0.9 g) were obtained from fraction H (2.2 g)
after CC (Sephadex LH-20, 3x50 cm, CHCl3-MeOH 3:2).
The EtOAc phase (19.8 g) upon CC over silanised silica
gel (70-230 mesh, 150 g) eluted with MeOH-H2O 7:3, MeOH
and CH2Cl2 successively, afforded 3 main fractions A→C.

CC of fraction A (8.9 g) (Silica gel, 70-230 mesh, 120 g,
hexane-CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2- EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH
gradients) yielded 66 fractions. The major constituents of
fractions 7-8 (45.0 mg) and 14-15 (50.0 mg) were found to
be 11 and 12, respectively, which were not further purified.
Fractions 23-28 yielded 13 (38.0 mg). CC of fraction B (7.3
g) (Silica gel, 70-230 mesh, 140 g, hexane-EtOAc and EtOAc-
MeOH mixtures) gave 40 fractions. Fractions 10-12
consisted of 5 (50.0 mg) and fractions 15-16 were further
separated on CC (Silica gel, 230-400 mesh, hexane-acetone
95:5) to afford 6 (6.0 mg), 10 (18.9 mg) and 11 (8.0 mg).
