INTRODUCTION
The use of traditional medicines which has not been 
tested in the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines, 
cannot be used like modern medicine1. Considered 
herbal medicines have an important role in the 
health sector, it should be to determine the quality 
and safety standards of medicinal plants extracts2. 
Standardization of medicinal plant extracts is one 
of the important stages in the development of 
natural medicines3.
One of potential plants as medicine is the 
dayak onion (Eleutherine bulbosa Urb.). This 
plants contained secondary metabolites such 
as phenols, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, 
tannins and quinones4,5. Bulbs of this plant had 
many activites such as immunomodulator6-8, 
antiinflamation9, antioxidant10, antihypertention11, 
antyhipercholesterol4,12 and anticancer13.
To develop this potential, standardization 
of extracts were carried out. It consisted of 
nonspecific and spesicfic parameters14. Beside it, 
bulbs of Eleutherine bulbosa Urb. were examined 
for the organoleptic, macroscopic and microscopic 
parameters15. Standardization of Eleutherine 
bulbosa Urb. bulbs had been carried out but 
from three different locations, that were Malang, 
Bogor, and Purbalingga (Java Island)16 and also the 
standardization of this plant had been done used 
different solvent, thas was ethanol 96 % which the 
plant only from east borneo17. Therefore this research 
needed to complete the standardization data for 70% 
ethanol extract of Eleutherine bulbosa Urb. bulbs and 
also to determined the total flavonoid content.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Plant collection 
Adult specimens of Eleutherine bulbosa Urb. plants 
were collected from three different location. The 
locations were Banjarbaru city, south borneo; 
palangkaraya city, central borneo and balikpapan 
city, east borneo. The sample were collected in the 
morning around 7-10 a.m. at Desember 2019. The 
collected plants were determinated at the Herbarium 
Bogoriense, Biology Research Center, Indonesian 
Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Bogor with number 
2242/IPH.1.01/If.07/XII/2019. Manufacture of 
simplicia started with collected the bulbs as part of 
the Eleutherine bulbosa Urb. plants will be used, then 
sample will sorted and washed with running water. 
Then chopped and dried the sample under the sun at 
7-10 a.m. The sample which had been dried, mashed 
with blender and sieved with mesh no. 16.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this study, bulbs of Eleutherine bulbosa Urb. extracted with maseration 
method used 70% ethanol. The yield extraction of sample from three 
locations presented at Table 1. Standardization of medicinal plants is 
an important step in conducting research and development of natural 
medicines to ensure the quality and safety of drug preparations15. 
Spesific parameter of 70% ethanol extract of bulbs of Eleutherine bulbosa 
Urb. tested consist of extract identity, organoleptic extract, microscopic 
test, water/ethanol soluble content and chromatography profile. 
Previous research results, the yield extract from Melak, West Kutai 
district, East Kalimantan used 96% ethanol as solvent produced yield 
1,49% w/w16. Based on these research, the yield used 70% ethanol was 
greater than 96% ethanol. This result because the polarity level of 70% 
ethanol higher than 96% ethanol so that was able to atrracted more 
compounds. 
Specific parameter desribe the identity an extract. The identification 
process is an important part of quality control of traditional medicine 
product because ingredients usually come from different cultivated 
areas, and have many physical similarities with other plants that are still 
of the same genus. The first parameter determined was extract identity. 
With the extract identity, it can be a specific clue to differentiate 
between plant extracts from one another. Then the organoleptic 
determination of the extract was the second step to check the quality of 
the extract by obsercing color, staste and odor. Water soluble content or 
ethanol soluble content were the next test. Each plant contains different 
compound, which of these chemical sbstances can be dissolved or 
attracted based on their respective polarity. In the Table 2, showed 
extract from three location were more soluble in ethanol compared 
water so it can be concluded the attracted compound were semipolar. 
The results of spesific parameter of extract identity, organoleptic and 
water/ethanol soluble content presented of Table 2.
Macroscopic and microscopic characters are one of the important 
criteria for identification25. Bulbs of Eleutherine bulbosa Urb between 
three location Kalimantan have the save from. The sample have whole 
bulbs in groups, each group consists of several bulb, part of bulb base 
is hard, the bulb surface is smooth, pointed ends and have oval form. 
At microscopic characters between three location have similarity, their 
have parenchyma with oil drops and isolated schlerencyma. The results 
of spesific parameter of macroscopic and microscopic presented of 
Figures 1 and 2.
The next parameter in extract standardization is chromatography 
profile.The determination of the chromatogram pattern was carried out 
by the TLC method which aimed to ceparated the compounds in the 
extract based on spot pattern and color after being observed on UV light 
and H2SO4 as spray reagents.The TLC profile is a qualitative analysis to 
show the presence of chemical compounds present in the sample19. The 
results showed there are four spot in TLC plate. The results of spesific 
parameter of TLC profile presented of Figure 3.

contamination (Pb dan Cd), microbial contamintation and mold yeast 
contamination. The result showed at Table 3. 
Specific gravity relates to purity and contamination. These results 
spesific gravity from three location almost the same with the result 
of previous resarch from fridayanti et. al., that was 0,9347 ± 0,0016. In 
this research, determination of water content used destilation method. 
The results appropriate requirment but its value almost value standard. 
One of the reason it can be happen because the solvent used was 70% 
ethanol which contains a high water content. 
Next determination were total ash cotent and acid insoluble ash content. 
This determination aims to provide an overview of the internal and 
external mineral content originated from the initial process until the 
extract formed13. At this stage the extract was heated until the organic 
compounds and their derivatives are destructed and evaporated until 
only the mineral and inorganic elements remain. Another nonspecific 
parameter was determined the residual solvent. If the residual solvent 
still high in the extract, it is possible to enter the body and give the side 
effect2. This method used GC-MS for analyze. Based on chromatogram 
pattern, the sample from three location proven negative. 
Heavy metal contamination determination aims to ensure that the 
extract does not contain certain heavy metal exceeding the specified 
values which are harmful to health. Two heavy metals tested were lead 
(Pb) and cadmium (Cd). Based on the result, the extracts accordance 
with the requirment. And the last non specific parameter were microbial 
contamination, mold and yeast contamination. This parameter aims to 
provide assurance that the extract does not contain microbes, mold and 
yeast exceed the requirment because it affects the stability of extract and 
harmful to healthy13. In this determination, the extract also accondace 
with the requirment. 
Based on metabolit secondary and activity from Eleutherine bulbosa 
Urb, total flavonoid content was determined. In this method used 
quercetin as standard. The results for maximum wavelength was 435 
nm, with operating time 30 minutes26. The maximum wavelength 
accordance with literature that stated the wavelength maximum for 
quercetin with this method was 415-440 nm26. 
Quercetin standard curve have regression y = 0,0132x + 0,0152, R2 = 
0,9998. Quercetin standard curve showed at Figure 4. Total flavonoid 
content used aluminium chloride as reagent. AlCl3 will reacted with 
C-4 at ketone group and C-3 or C-5 at hydroxyl group from flavonoid 
structure28. The reaction between AlCl3  and quercetion showed at Figure 
5. Furthermore determination of total flavonoid content for Eleutherine 
bulbosa Urb from three location. The result for total flavonoid content 
presented at Table 4 showed the highest total flavonoid content from 
palangkaraya city as 7,585 ± 0,0437 mg QE/g extract. Eventhough the

sample have the same species, differences in the content of flavonoid 
compounds can be influenced by several factors such as genetics, the 
enviroment (climate, soil quality, water quality), the addition of growth 
support materials and harvest time2. 
CONCLUSION
it can be concluded that bulbs of Eleutherine bulbosa Urb. from three 
locations on the nonspesific and specific parameters have characters to
