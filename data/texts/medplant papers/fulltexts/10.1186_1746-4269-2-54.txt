Abstract
Diseases of ear, nose and throat (ENT) often have serious consequences including hearing
impairment, and emotional strain that lower the quality of life of patients. In Kenya, upper
respiratory infections are among the most common infections encountered in outpatient facilities.
Some of these infections are becoming difficult to control because some of the causing
microorganisms have acquired antibiotic resistance and hence the need to develop new drugs with
higher efficacy. Ethnobotanical studies have now been found to be instrumental in improving
chances of discovering plants with antimicrobial activity in new drug development. In Kenya the
majority of local people are turning to herbal remedies for primary health care needs. In most cases
the sources of these remedies are undocumented and the knowledge about them passed orally
form generation to generation, hence under threat of disappearing with current rates of
modernisation.
This study explored the traditional remedies used in managing various ENT diseases in seven
districts of the Central Province of Kenya. The most common ENT conditions managed using
traditional therapies include: common cold, cough, tonsillitis, otitis-media, chest pains and asthma.
The results indicate that 67 species belonging to 36 plant families were utilized in this region. These
plants were of varying habits; herbs (37.3%), shrubs (34.4%), trees (25.4%) as well as some grasses
and sedges (3%). The traditional preparations were found to be made mainly from leaves (49%),
roots (20.5%) and barks (12.5%). For each of the ENT conditions multiple species are utilized
mainly as individual preparations but occasionally as polyherbal concoctions. In the case of common
cold for example, 30 different species are used. Plants reported in this survey are important
candidates for antimicrobial tests against ENT disease causing micro-organisms, especially those
with antibiotic resistance.
Background
Diseases of the ear, nose and throat (ENT) affect the func-
tioning of adults as well as children, often with significant
impairment of the daily life of affected patients [1]. It has
been envisaged that with increase in global population,
infections remain the most important causes of disease,
with upper respiratory infections causing hearing loss and
learning disability particularly in children [2]. Ear infec-
tions such as chronic otitis-media have serious conse-
quences in developing countries, such as retarded

language development and progress in school among
children [3,4]. Otitis-media, which is now known to be
the most common childhood infection, leads annually to
the death of over 50,000 children under 5 years [5]. In
other cases nasal conditions may be distressing, as in the
case of nasal myiasis/maggots in the nose [6].
In most countries in the developing world the number of
otolaryngologists is negligible, while the problem is com-
plicated by the fact that there is no training for public
health otolaryngology and other ENT-related otolaryngol-
ogy personnel [2,4]. This lack of trained personnel is of
particular concern in African countries because the preva-
lence rates of some of the ENT disease such as chronic oti-
tis-media is as high as 65% [7]. This problem as well as
increased costs of conventional medicine has caused local
people in Kenya and in other developing countries to seek
treatment from traditional therapies.
Diseases of the ear, nose and throat can be caused by a
variety of microorganisms. Rhinoviruses are the leading
cause for common cold in all age groups for example,
while enteroviruses are frequently associated [8]. Acute
phryngitis/nosilitis is mainly associated with respiratory
viruses, although bacteria, especially Streptococus spp. are
found in some patients [9]. It has been shown that the
nose is the main ecological niche where some of the drug
resistant microorganisms like Staphylococcus aureus reside
[10]. Although acute otitis-media is caused by bacteria the
leading one being Streptococcus pneumoniae [11], viral
infection are a predisposing factor for its development
[8,12]. In communities that use antibiotics, Streptococcus
pneumoniae  rapidly acquire antibiotics resistance, often
complicating this disease burden [11].
Tuberculosis is regarded as the oldest disease in man,
affecting almost every organ of the body and causing
about 2 million deaths annually [13]. Cases of tuberculo-
sis are on the increase globally, with HIV/AIDS leading to
re-emergence of extra pulmonary presentations [14].
While initial tuberculosis infections occur in the lungs,
forms that occur for example in tonsils and the ear are
now known to occur particularly in regions such as Africa
where the disease is endemic [15].
Although antibiotics have contributed to the control of
ENT infections, their over-use and misuse is now seen to
cause an increase in antibiotic resistance [16]. Some of the
chronic sinus ENT diseases resistant to current antibiotics
include chronic middle ear infections, chronic sinus dis-
eases, chronic coughs and recurrent pharyngo-tonsillitis
[17]. Air pollution has been on the increase and is now
known to directly affect the nose and the larynx causing
inflammation, irritations and eventually infection. Even
the ear is affected when the pollutants enter the mucosa of
the tuba, causing impairment of the middle ear [18]. With
increasing resistance of microorganisms associated with
ENT infections and increasing environmental pollution,
alternative sources for new drugs are necessary. These
might be obtained from plants used in traditional medi-
cines to control or treat these diseases. People in Kenya are
now turning to the use of traditional herbal medicines so
as to meet their primary healthcare needs [19].
In Kenya diseases of the respiratory tract are among the
most common illnesses in outpatient clinics [20]. These
diseases, combined with malaria, account for half the dis-
eases reported in outpatient facilities [21]. Since some of
the ENT disease causing microorganisms have become
resistant to current antibiotics, there is need to investigate
means of developing new, efficacious drugs.
Studies have now shown that ethobotanically-derived
phytochemicals have greater activity than compounds
derived from random screening and therefore a greater
potential for products developed [22,23]. One study for
example, has shown that 86% of plants species reported
in Samoan pharmaceutical ethnopharmacopoeia showed
pharmacological activity [24]. Further, many drugs in
clinical use today were discovered from the way plants
were used in traditional communities. Examples include
quinine which, was discovered from the way traditional
communities in S. America especially Peru, Columbia and
Bolivia used plant species of the genus Cinchona in man-
aging fevers [25]. Digitoxin on the other hand is a popular
heart tonic obtained from Digitalis purpurea, a plant that
was in use as heart tonic in traditional communities in
Europe. Taxol is a modern therapy for ovarian cancer
obtained from Taxus brevifolia which was a traditional
medicinal plant in British Columbia [26].
This study investigated the diversity of traditional medi-
cines used for the management of ear, nose and throat
infections among the Kikuyus in Central Kenya with the
aim of documenting plants that have potential for pro-
duction of improved traditional medicines from local
resources, as well as plants to be targeted for antimicrobial
activity against microorganisms that cause ear, nose and
throat infections especially those known to have devel-
oped antibiotic resistance.
Materials and methods
The Central Province of Kenya covers the area around
Mount Kenya, where most of the Kikuyus live. The total
population is estimated at 3,724,159 inhabitants in an
area of 13,191 Km2. The Kikuyus are the largest single eth-
nic group in Kenya and account for 21% of the country's
population [27].Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:54 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/54

This study was part of a larger ethnobotanical survey
involving over one hundred respondents, carried out for
three years (2001–2004) among the Kikuyus of Central
Kenya, comprising seven districts: Thika, Murang'a,
Kiambu, Maragwa, Nyandarua, Kirinyaga and Nyeri (Fig-
ure 1). This study focuses on results from 64 respondents
who used traditional therapies in management of ENT
conditions for self medication or in treating others. Initial
contacts were made with research assistants in all the dis-
tricts to explain the aim of the research. These assistants
were local people who knew the kikuyu language well,
had lived in the area long enough and were familiar with
the local people. Prior informed consent was sought with
the respondents who were randomly selected in each area.
During the surveys semi-structured questionnaires were
used to carry out the interviews, which targeted common
ear, nose and throat infections known to the respondents,
plant species used, parts used, methods of preparations as
well as administration of the drugs. In some cases inter-
viewees were accompanied in their plant collecting duties
and observations made of the plants being collected.
Where the respondents were uncomfortable with the
questionnaires, discussions and informal interviews were
employed and in the process information on traditional
management of ENT infections obtained. During discus-
sions, information on combination therapy or poly
herbal management of ENT conditions were noted and
recorded. Any use of none plant remedies for manage-
ment of ENT infections were recorded.
Plants said to be useful in managing various ENT ailments
during the interviews were visually identified in the field
by the respondents. Voucher specimens were collected in
duplicates using standard taxonomic procedures particu-
larly recording important features for identification in the
herbarium. Each specimen included vital parts such as
leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits where available. For
small herbaceous plants, whole plants were usually col-
lected. For every specimen collected the vernacular names
were also recorded. The specimens were dried in the her-
barium and then mounted on sheets.
The collected plant material was identified at the Jomo
Kenyatta University Herbarium, using the relevant local
floras and other taxonomic literature [28-30]. Assistance
in identification was sought from an experienced botanist
(Mr Simon Mathenge) of the University of Nairobi Her-
barium. The collections at Nairobi University Herbarium
as well as Jomo Kenyatta University Herbarium were used
to make comparisons with the identified specimens. To
systematically collect data on management of ENT dis-
eases in this region, questionnaires, semi-structured inter-
views, informal interviews and discussions with resource
people were applied. Interviews were also supplemented
by participant observations and consistent field walks to
identify the medicinal plants cited and collect ethnothera-
peautic specimens.
Results and discussion
This study found 67 species in 36 plant families as useful
in management of ENT conditions in Central Kenya
(Table 1) Of these, 24 species were cited three or more
times during the field surveys. Some of the species with
high frequency of mention included Eucalyptus saligna,
Lippia javanica and Ocimum gratissimum (Figure 2). The
highest proportion of species used was herbs (37.3%), fol-
lowed by shrubs (34.3%) and trees (25.4%). Sedges and
grasses on the other hand comprised of 3% of the species
used in ENT infections management in this region. Whiles
one species would have different parts used; this study
shows that most of the drug preparations were obtained
from leaves (49%) and reasonable amounts from barks
(12.5%) and roots (20.5%). Harvesting plant medicines
from barks is known to be the most destructive method of
harvesting particularly because debarked trees rarely sur-
vive [31]. The trees and shrubs from which ENT concoc-
tions are obtained from barks and roots are likely to be in
danger of over-exploitation and their conservation status
need further investigation.
The most cited ENT disease managed through traditional
therapies was found to be the common cold (Figure 3).
This condition which has several Kikuyu names (ikhuti,
homa, njoma) is managed usually by use of individual spe-
cies which are mainly boiled and administered by inhala-
tion or leaves crushed and directly inhaled. In a few cases
polyherbal preparations were noted especially the mixture
of leaves of Ocimum bacilicum, O. gratissimum and lippia
javanica which are boiled together and inhaled while the
patient is covered with a thick piece of cloth such as a
blanket.
Some studies have shown that viruses are associated with
about two-thirds of the cases of common cold among
children, while bacteria have been associated with about
4% of the cases. Among these viruses the leading ones are
Rhinoviruses which cause common cold in all age groups
but enteroviruses are also associated [8]. In the study area,
about 30 plant species were found to be utilized for man-
agement of common cold. Extracts from these plants need
to be a priority in testing for antimicrobial activity for fur-
ther development of local drugs useful in management of
colds.
The current study revealed that 13 plant species were used
in managing Otitis media (Njika/bũra, in Kikuyu) in Cen-
tral Kenya (Table 1). Extracts from these plants need to be
tested for their activity against some of these bacteria but
also against viruses because viruses are known to be a pre-Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:54 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/54

disposing factor for the development of acute otitis-media
[11]. Lubricants from the industries and fat from chicken
were also found to be installed into affected ears as a
means of managing this condition. Further in some cases
the queen stage of the termites were also found to be
crushed and the resulting mixture installed in the affected
ear(s). In a few cases the tail of the chameleon (alive) is
also installed briefly into the affected ear(s). It is not clear
whether this has any therapeutic value, but it is worth fur-
ther investigation.
Otitis-media is known to be the most common bacterial
infection especially among children. Sometimes it has
severe complications, which have high economic impacts
[11]. Studies in Kenya show that this disease causes sen-
sori-neural hearing impairment among pre-school chil-
dren, in addition to other complications [4]. On a global
scale otitis-media is a major indication for antibiotic use
with the consequence that some of the microorganisms
associated with this condition have acquired antibiotic
resistance as in the case of Pneumoccoci,  Staphylococcus
aureus, Hemophilus influenzae  among others [2,10,11].
The traditional therapies cited in this study need to be
screened to authenticate their use in managing this condi-
tion.
Sixteen plant species were used in managing tonsillitis in
Central Kenya. In some of the cases the plant extracts were
applied externally as in the case of the sap from Datura
stramonium stems and bulb of Crinum macawanii. These
plants are known to have analgesic properties [25] but
their antimicrobial activity and those of the species that
are either boiled or chewed need to be established. Respi-
ratory viruses such as Adenoviruses, Epstein-Barr viruses,

influenza viruses and enteroviruses as well as bacteria are
responsible for acute tonsillitis. Some of these for exam-
ple, hemolytic Streptococci have already developed anti-
biotic resistance [8]. These microorganisms among others
need to be the key targets for antimicrobial tests.
Asthma was one of the ENT allergic conditions tradition-
ally managed using plant extracts in Central Kenya. The
plants used in this case may be important sources of anti-
allergic preparations, which warrant further study.
Conclusion
This study revealed that the commonest ENT diseases
managed through traditional therapies were common
cold, Otitis media, cough, tonsillitis, asthma and chest
pains. This research further revealed that 67 plant species
are used in management of ENT infections in Central
Kenya, while 24 of these species are mentioned three or
more times during the field survey. There are also some
none plant remedies such as fat, oils and animal parts
cited in this study.
These remedies form an important database for bioassay
guided identification and purification of important thera-
peutic compounds, antimicrobial trials on their efficacy
and further development of improved traditional medi-
cines or other new drugs for management of ENT infec-
tions. In the case of polyherbal preparations, their
synergistic effects need further investigation. The study
also reveals plants whose medicines are obtained in
destructive manner and hence these species may need
their conservation status to be investigated.
Since ethobotanically-derived phytochemicals have
greater activity than compounds derived from random
screening and therefore a greater potential for new drug
products developed, it is expected that the results of this
study will lead to pharmacological investigations with the
plants showing reasonable antimicrobial activity.
