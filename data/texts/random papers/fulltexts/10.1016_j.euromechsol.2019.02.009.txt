Mode I crack tip fields: strain gradient plasticity theory

Abstract
The mode I crack tip asymptotic response of a solid characterised by strain
gradient plasticity is investigated. It is found that elastic strains dominate
plastic strains near the crack tip, and thus the Cauchy stress and the strain
state are given asymptotically by the elastic K-field. This crack tip elas-
tic zone is embedded within an annular elasto-plastic zone. This feature is
predicted by both a crack tip asymptotic analysis and a finite element com-
putation. When small scale yielding applies, three distinct regimes exist: an
outer elastic K field, an intermediate elasto-plastic field, and an inner elas-
tic K field. The inner elastic core significantly influences the crack opening
profile. Crack tip plasticity is suppressed when the material length scale ℓ
of the gradient theory is on the order of the plastic zone size estimation, as
dictated by the remote stress intensity factor. A generalized J-integral for
strain gradient plasticity is stated and used to characterise the asymptotic
response ahead of a short crack. Finite element analysis of a cracked three

1. Introduction
Strain gradient plasticity is increasingly used in fracture analyses to pre-
dict the stress elevation that accompanies gradients of plastic strain, see, for
example, (Wei and Hutchinson, 1997; Jiang et al., 2001; Komaragiri et al.,
2008; Nielsen et al., 2012; Mart´ınez-Pan˜eda et al., 2017b) and references therein.
Gradients of plastic strain are associated with lattice curvature and geo-
metrically necessary dislocations (Ashby, 1970), and the increased disloca-
tion density promotes strengthening. Flow stress elevation in the presence
of plastic strain gradients has been observed in a wide range of mechani-
cal tests on micro-sized specimens. Representative examples are indenta-
tion (Poole et al., 1996; Nix and Gao, 1998), torsion (Fleck et al., 1994), and
bending (Sto¨lken and Evans, 1998). These experiments typically predict a
3-fold increase in the effective flow stress by reducing the size of the speci-
men (smaller is stronger). Isotropic, strain gradient plasticity theories have
been developed to capture this size effect. The pivotal step in construct-
ing these phenomenological models is to write the plastic work increment in
terms of both the plastic strain and plastic strain gradient, thereby introduc-
ing a length scale in the material description (Aifantis, 1984; Gao et al., 1999;
Fleck and Hutchinson, 2001; Gurtin and Anand, 2005). Work-conjugate stress
2
quantities for plastic strain and plastic strain gradient follow immediately.
The crack tip stress elevation, as predicted by strain gradient plasticity
theory relative to conventional plasticity theory, plays a fundamental role in
the modelling of numerous damage mechanisms (Mart´ınez-Pan˜eda and Betego´n,
2015; Mart´ınez-Pan˜eda and Niordson, 2016). Examples include fatigue (Brinckmann and Siegmund,
2008; Pribe et al., 2019), notch mechanics (Mart´ınez-Pan˜eda et al., 2017a),
microvoid cracking (Tvergaard and Niordson, 2008), and hydrogen embrit-
tlement (Mart´ınez-Pan˜eda et al., 2016a,b).
In the present study, we examine the mode I crack tip field according
to strain gradient plasticity theory (Gudmundson, 2004; Fleck and Willis,
2009). Previous crack tip asymptotic studies considered earlier gradient
plasticity classes, such as couple-stress theories without stretch gradients
(Huang et al., 1997; Xia and Hutchinson, 1996) or models involving the gra-
dients of elastic strains (Chen et al., 1999). For such theories, plastic strains
dominate elastic strains near the crack tip and the asymptotic nature of the
crack tip field can be obtained by neglecting elasticity. This is analogous to
the HRR (Hutchinson, 1968; Rice and Rosengren, 1968) analysis for a con-
ventional elasto-plastic solid.
We shall show in the present study that the crack tip field for Gudmundson-
type strain gradient theories is of a different nature, such that the asymptotic
crack tip field comprises both elastic and plastic straining, and it is not pos-
sible to simplify the crack tip asymptotic state by neglecting elastic strains.

Instead, the elastic strain εeij scales as r
−1/2 with distance r from the crack
tip, whereas the plastic strain tensor ε
∼
p (x) is of the form
ε
∼
p (x) = ε
∼
p (0) + ε˜
∼
p (x) + · · · (1)
The leading order term ε
∼
p (0) has a finite value independent of x. The
next term in the series, ε˜
∼
p (x), scales as r3/2 where r = |x| is the polar coor-
dinate from the crack tip, and ε˜
∼
p (x) also depends upon the polar coordinate
θ. Thus, we can write εpij in polar coordinates as,
− εprr = εpθθ = A cos (2θ) + r3/2f (θ) + · · · (2)
εprθ = A sin (2θ) + r
3/2g (θ) + · · · (3)
Later, in the paper, we shall obtain explicit expressions for the angular
functions f (θ) and g (θ). Thus, the elastic strain is more singular than the
plastic strain and the Cauchy stress σij (r, θ) is given by the usual elastic
K-field in the vicinity of the crack tip.
The following simple argument supports the finding that the crack tip is
surrounded by an elastic K-field in an elastic-plastic strain gradient solid.
Introduce a generalized effective plastic strain E˜p such that
(

εpijε

ij + ℓ
2εpij,kε
p
ij,k (4)
in terms of a material length scale ℓ; the comma subscript (),k denotes spa-
tial differentiation with respect to the coordinate xk in the usual manner.
Consider the case of a deformation theory solid, and assume that the plastic
strain energy density wp scales as E˜p
(N+1)
in terms of a strain hardening
4
exponent N (where 0 ≤ N ≤ 1). We proceed to show that the elastic strain
must dominate the plastic strain. To do so, we shall explore the consequences
of assuming that the plastic strain dominates the elastic strain near the crack
tip. Then, wp must scale as J/r in order for the energy release rate for crack
advance to be finite at the crack tip. Consequently, E˜p and ℓεpij,k scale as
r−1/(N+1) and εpij scales as r
N/(N+1). We conclude that εpij tends to zero as
the crack tip is approached. If the elastic strain is dominated by the plastic
strain then this implies that εeij tends to zero at a faster rate than r
N/(N+1),
and the crack tip will have a strain and a stress concentration of zero. This
is implausible on physical grounds. We conclude that the elastic strain field
must dominate the plastic strain field at the crack tip, and the Cauchy stress
and elastic strain are given by the usual elastic K-field.
2. Strain Gradient Plasticity
We idealise strain gradient effects by means of the Gudmundson (2004)
higher order gradient plasticity model, see also Fleck and Willis (2009). A
brief summary of the constitutive and field equations for a flow theory version
of strain gradient plasticity is now presented.
2.1. Variational principles and balance equations
The primal kinematic variables are the velocity u˙i and the plastic strain
rate ε˙pij. Upon adopting a small strain formulation, the total strain rate reads
ε˙ij =
1

(u˙i,j + u˙j,i) (5)
and is decomposed additively into elastic and plastic parts,
ε˙ij = ε˙

Write the internal work within a volume V as

)
dV (7)
where σij denotes the Cauchy stress, qij the so-called micro-stress tensor
(work-conjugate to the plastic strain εpij) and τijk is the higher order stress
tensor (work-conjugate to the plastic strain gradient εpij,k). The volume V
is contained within a surface S of unit outward normal ni. Now make use
of Gauss’ divergence theorem to re-express δW as the external work on the
surface S,
δW =
∫
S

σijnjδui + τijknkδε
p
ij
)
dS (8)
to obtain the following equilibrium equations within V :
σij,j = 0
sij = qij − τijk,k (9)
Here, sij is the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress such that sij = σij −
δijσkk/3. Equations (7) and (8) constitute the Principle of Virtual Work,∫

where Cijkl = Cklij is the isotropic elastic stiffness tensor, given in terms

σij =

The stresses (qij , τijk) are taken to be dissipative in nature and we assume
that the plastic work rate w˙p reads,

where w˙p(E˙p) is given in terms of a combined effective plastic strain rate,

thereby introducing a material length scale ℓ. The use of (13) implies imme-
diately that
qij =

∂ε˙pij

Upon introducing an overall effective stress Σ = ∂w˙p/∂E˙p, these expres-
sions reduce to

3. Asymptotic analysis of crack tip fields
3.1. Deformation theory solid
We begin our study by conducting an asymptotic analysis of the stress
and strain state at the crack tip. As already discussed in the introduc-
tion, consider a deformation theory solid such that the strain energy density
w
(
εeij , ε
p
ij, ε
p
ij,k
)
is decomposed into an elastic part we and a plastic part wp,
w
(
εeij, ε

p
ij,k
)
= we
(
εeij
)
+ wp
(
εpij, ε
p
ij,k
)
(20)
The elastic contribution is stated explicitly by (11). For the deformation
theory solid the effective strain quantity E˜p has already been introduced by
(4). The dissipation potential wp is taken to be a power law function of E˜p
wp

(21)
in terms of a reference value of strength σY , yield strain εY = σY /E and hard-
ening index N (where 0 ≤ N ≤ 1). Upon writing the dissipation increment
δwp as
δwp = qijδε
p
ij + τijkδε
p
ij,k (22)
and upon introducing the notation Σ = ∂wp/∂E˜p, we have
qij =

We note in passing that substitution of (23)-(24) into (4) recovers (19),
and the relation between Σ and E˜p is of power law type, such that
Σ =

via (22).
3.2. Energy boundness analysis
We proceed to obtain the asymptotic nature of εpij (r, θ). The finite ele-
ment solutions presented later in the study consistently reveal that the de-
viatoric Cauchy stress sij scales as r
−1/2. We shall adopt this scaling law for
sij and explore its ramifications. First, note from (23) and (24) that τijk,
and consequently τijk,k, are more singular in r than qij , as the crack tip is
approached. Then, the equilibrium relation (9)b demands that
sij ∼ −τijk,k (26)
to leading order in r, and consequently τijk is of order r
1/2. This imposes a
severe restriction on the form of εpij (r, θ). Assume the separation of variables
form for εpij in terms of its Cartesian components
εpij = Aij + r
αBij (θ) + · · · (27)
where Aij is taken to be independent of θ and the index α > 0 remains to be
found. First we show that this form satisfies the field equations, and second
we justify this choice. Accordingly, the plastic strain gradient reads
εpij,k = αr
α−1B¯ijk (θ) + · · · (28)
where B¯ijk can be expressed in terms of Bij (θ) and its derivatives with respect
to θ. Substitution of (27) and (28) into (4) gives
(
E˜p

Consequently, (26), (24) and (28) give

(31)
Upon recalling that sij scales as r
−1/2 the above equation implies that
α = 3/2 for consistency. The above solution reveals that the elastic strain
energy density wE scales as r−1 while the plastic strain energy density scales
as r0, upon recalling (21) and (29). Now recall that we require w ∼ J/r in
order for w = we + wp to give a finite energy release rate J at the crack tip.
This is achieved by the elastic field whereas the plastic field is not sufficiently
singular in r to give any contribution to the energy release rate. Alternative
assumptions can be made for the series expansion of εpij in preference to (27).
However, these do not give rise to an equilibrium solution (i.e., Eq. (26) is
not satisfied) or they give solutions that are less singular than that of (29).
For example, if we assume that the Cartesian components Aij are a function
of θ we find that εpij,k scales as r
−1 and τijk,k scales as r
−(N+1), and the equi-
librium relation (29) for sij is violated. Alternatively, if we take Aij = 0 then
an equilibrium solution for sij is obtained provided we take α = N/(N + 1).
This leads to a higher order term in the series expansion of εpij than that
given by the first two terms of (29). Finally, what is the implication of as-
suming that α < 0 in our asymptotic expression (29)? If we were to assume
α < 0, then the leading order term becomes rαBij (θ). Asymptotic matching
of both sides of the equilibrium relation (26) again results in α = N/(N +1),
which is inconsistent with the initial assumption that α < 0.
10
In summary, the plastic strain field εpij (r, θ) is of the asymptotic form (27)
with α = 3/2, and the crack tip field for Cauchy stress σij (r, θ) and elastic
strain εeij (r, θ) is given by the usual K-field for a mode I crack.
3.3. Asymptotic crack tip fields
Assume that the leading order terms in εpij, in polar coordinates, are of
the form (2)-(3). This choice is consistent with the nature of the symmetry of
the solution of a mode I crack tip problem; εpθθ and ε
p
rr are even in θ and give
rise to εpyy = A = −εpxx, εpxy = 0 in Cartesian coordinates. The components
of the plastic strain gradient and the Laplacian of the plastic strain read

Nowmake use of the higher order equilibrium equation (9)b, which asymp-
totically implies sij ≈ −τijk,k. Note that, as r → 0, E˜p is of leading order
2A/
√
3 and can therefore be treated as a constant. As argued above and
demonstrated numerically below, the Cauchy stress is characterized by an
inner elastic K-field. Consequently, we make use of the Williams (1957)
solution to write
srr =

(39)
where KI is the mode I stress intensity factor. The higher order equilibrium
follows by suitable substitution of (36)-(39) into (24) and (9)b, to give

In addition, the symmetry condition ahead of a mode I crack tip demands
that f (θ) is an even function of θ. Thus, the solution to the system of
differential equations is given by
f (θ) = − KIE˜

(43)
Now make use of the traction-free boundary conditions trr = tθθ = 0
along the crack flanks (θ = π) to obtain a relation between the constants a1
12
and a3. Free boundary conditions on the higher order traction τθθθ = 0 on
θ = π implies that
f ′ (θ) + 2g (θ) = 0 at θ = π (44)
rendering a1 = 7/3 − a3. Imposition of vanishing higher order traction
τrθθ = 0 on θ = π is identically satisfied and provides no useful additional in-
formation on (a1, a3). It follows that numerical analysis is needed to calibrate
a1 and a3 and obtain a full field solution.
4. Finite element analysis
4.1. Numerical implementation
Wemake use of the finite element implementation of Mart´ınez-Pan˜eda et al.
(2019) and employ the viscoplastic potential presented by Panteghini and Bardella
(2016). The effective stress is related to the gradient-enhanced effective plas-
tic flow rate through a viscoplastic function,
Σ = σF (E
p) V (E˙p) (45)
where the current flow stress σF depends on the initial yield stress σY and
on Ep via a hardening law. We adopt the following isotropic hardening law,
σF = σY
(
1 +
Ep
εY
)N
(46)
and assume that the yield strain is εY = σY /E = 0.003. The viscoplastic
function V (E˙p) is defined as
V (E˙p) =


E˙p/ (2ε˙0) if E˙
p/ε˙0 ≤ 1
1− ε˙0/
(
2E˙p
)
if E˙p/ε˙0 > 1
(47)
13
and the rate-independent limit is achieved by choosing a sufficiently small
value of the material parameter ε˙0. The numerical experiments conducted
show that the ratio E˙p/ε˙0 is sufficiently high that V (E˙
p) ≈ 1 in the vicinity
of the crack for all remote K values considered.
A mixed finite element scheme is adopted, such that displacements and
plastic strains are treated as primary variables, in accordance with the the-
oretical framework. The non-linear system of equations for a time t +∆t is
solved iteratively by using the Newton-Raphson method,

4.2. The small scale yielding solution
We make use of the so-called boundary layer formulation to prescribe an
outerK-field. Consider a crack with tip at the origin and with the crack plane
14
along the negative axis of the Cartesian reference frame (x, y). A remote K
field is imposed by prescribing the nodal displacements in the outer periphery
of the mesh as,
ui =
K
E
r1/2fi (θ, ν) (51)
where ν is Poisson’s ratio and the functions fi (θ, ν) are given by
fx =
1 + ν√
2π
(3− 4ν − cos θ) cos
(
θ
2
)
(52)
and
fy =
1 + ν√
2π
(3− 4ν − cos θ) sin
(
θ
2
)
(53)
Upon exploiting the symmetry about the crack plane, only half of the
finite element model is analysed. A mesh sensitivity study reveals that it
is adequate to discretise the domain by approximately 5200 plane strain,
quadratic, quadrilateral elements.
A representative small scale yielding solution is now presented in Figs.
1 and 2, for the choice K = 20σY
√
ℓ, N = 0.1, εY = 0.003, and ν = 0.3.
Conventional J2 flow theory implies a plastic zone size R0 of magnitude
R0 =
1
3π
(
K
σY
)2
(54)
and so the choice K = 20σY
√
ℓ implies R0 = 42ℓ. Consequently, the plastic
zone size is much larger than ℓ for the strain gradient solid also. The plastic
zone is plotted in Fig. 1 by showing contours of von Mises plastic strain,
εp =
(
2
3
εpijε
p
ij
)1/2
(55)
15
In broad terms, the outer boundary of the plastic zone is given by the con-
tour εp/εY = 0.1. Additional contours for εp/εY = 1 and 3 are included. It
is found that εp/εY attains a plateau value slightly greater than 3 within the
contour εp/εY = 3. Consequently, the stress state within this crack tip zone
is elastic in nature. This finding is supported by a plot of tensile stress σyy as
a function of r directly ahead of the crack tip (y = 0), see Fig. 2a. The stress
component σyy scales as r
−1/2 for sufficiently small r. Likewise, the elastic
strain component εeyy scales as r
−1/2 for r/ℓ < 1, see Fig. 2b. Farther from
the crack tip (1 < r/ℓ < 10) the stress profile σyy varies with r in the manner
of the HRR field, σθθ ∼ r−N/(N+1). Beyond the plastic zone (r/ℓ > 10) the
stress state again converges to the elastic K-field and σyy scales as r
−1/2.
Thus, both an outer and an inner K field exist. The distributions of εeyy(r)
and εpyy(r) are shown in Fig. 2b. Within the elastic zone at the crack tip, and
in the outer elastic zone, we have εeyy >> ε
p
yy. In contrast, within the annual
region of the crack tip plastic zone, the plastic strains dominate and εpyy > ε
e
yy.
The following J-integral argument can be used to show that the magni-
tude of K for the crack tip elastic zone is identical to that in the outer field.
Write the potential energy P of the cracked solid as
P (a) =
∫
V
w dV −
∫
ST
(
T∞i ui + t
∞
ij ε
p
ij
)
dS (56)
where (T∞i , t
∞
ij ) are the prescribed tractions on a partial boundary ST , with
outward normal ni. Define J as the energy release rate per unit crack exten-
sion, such that
J = −∂P
∂a
(57)
16
for a body of unit thickness in the z direction. Note that∮ (
wnx − σijnjui,x − τijknkεpij,x
)
dS ≡ 0 (58)
for any closed contour in the solid that excludes the crack tip. Also note
that σijnj = 0 and τijknk = 0 on the faces of a traction-free crack. Then, an
evaluation of J for a contour Γ which encloses the crack tip, starts on the
lower crack flank and ends on the upper flank, gives
J =
∫
Γ
(
wnx − σijnjui,x − τijknkεpij,x
)
dS (59)
where the crack lies along the negative x-axis. The proof is straightforward
and follows that outlined by (Eshelby, 1956; Rice, 1968) for the conventional
deformation theory solid, absent strain gradient effects.
Now evaluate the contour integral J assuming that the stress state (and
associated strain energy density w) is given by an elastic K-field. Direct
evaluation gives the Irwin relation EJ/(1− ν2) = K2. Upon performing this
integration within the crack tip elastic zone of the strain gradient solid, and
repeating the evaluation in the outer K-field remote from the crack tip, path
independence of J immediately implies that the magnitude of K is the same
in the two zones.
4.3. Sensitivity of crack tip fields to strain hardening and material length
scale
We proceed to examine the influence of the strain hardening exponent N
upon the crack tip stress state, see Fig. 3a. Consistent with the analytical
17
asymptotic analysis of Section 3, the near-tip asymptotic response is inde-
pendent of the value of N and the three regimes (outer K, elastic-plastic field
and inner K) can be readily identified for the three values of N considered.
The strain state near the crack tip is shown in the form of the components εpyy
and εyy versus r/ℓ in Fig. 3b. The asymptotic value of ε
p
yy(r → 0) increases
slightly with decreasing N . The zone of almost constant εpyy near the crack
tip is of similar size for N = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3: the size of the elastic core
scales with ℓ and is independent of N .
The dependence of εpyy(r → 0) upon K/(σY
√
ℓ) is plotted in Fig. 4 for
selected values of N . At small K/(σY
√
ℓ), negligible plasticity exists near
the crack tip - the plastic zone vanishes. At larger K/(σY
√
ℓ) a plastic zone
exists and εpyy(r → 0) increases.
The tensile stress component σyy is shown as a function of r in Fig. 5 for
several values of ℓ/R0. The reference size of the plastic zone R0 is given by
Irwin’s approximation (54). For the strain gradient solid the plastic zone is
approximately of size R0 since σyy/σY ≈ 1 at r/R0 = 1 for all ℓ/R0 values
considered. Also, the inner elastic zone is of extent ℓ to a good approxima-
tion. Consequently, the active plastic zone exists between r ∼ ℓ and r ∼ R0.
4.4. Influence on the crack profile and in inhibiting plasticity
Strain gradient plasticity influences the crack tip profile δ(r) behind the
crack tip. Fig. 6 shows the crack opening profile for conventional (ℓ = 0)
and strain gradient plasticity (ℓ = 0.05R0), along with the solutions from the
HRR field and from linear elasticity. The HRR field crack opening profile is
18
given by
σYEδ
K2
= α
(
rσYE
K2
) N
N+1
(60)
while the elastic solution reads
σYEδ
K2
= β
(
rσYE
K2
) 1
2
(61)
with α = 0.18 and β = 0.48. The finite element results show large differences
between conventional and gradient-enhanced plasticity solutions. Strain gra-
dient plasticity sharpens the crack profile to resemble that of an elastic solid.
Now consider the sensitivity of the plastic zone size rp to the magnitude
of K/(σY
√
ℓ). We have already noted that, when K/(σY
√
ℓ) is significantly
large, the plastic zone size scales with Irwin’s approximation R0 as given
by (54). In contrast, when K/(σY
√
ℓ) is small, we anticipate that the inner
elastic core of dimension ℓ dominates the plastic zone; this is shown in Fig.
7. In order to define the size of the plastic zone rp, a criterion is needed
for active yielding. Here, we assume that the plastic zone extends to either
the location where εp/εY = 0.1 or 1, see Fig. 7. It is clear from the figure
that the plastic zone size rp scales with K
2/σ2Y in the same manner as the
conventional elastic-plastic solid for sufficiently large K/(σY
√
ℓ). However,
at small K/(σY
√
ℓ), on the order of 5 to 10, the plastic zone vanishes. At an
intermediate value ofK/(σY
√
ℓ) the active plastic zone for the strain gradient
solid is somewhat larger than that predicted for the conventional solid.
4.5. Regime of J-dominance
The small scale yielding (SSY) approach is valid provided the crack
length is much greater than the plastic zone size R0 at the onset of frac-
19
ture, a > 7.5πR0. Thus, on a map with axes a/R0 and ℓ/R0 the small scale
yielding regime exists for a/R0 > 7.5π; this is shown explicitly in Fig. 8. If
a/R0 is in the range 75πεY < a/R0 < 7.5π, then a J-field exists near the
crack tip and the valid loading parameter becomes J instead of K. This
regime of J-dominance is also sketched in Fig. 8. We proceed to explore
the stress state near the crack tip for the case of J-dominance. To do so
we consider a deeply notched beam in three point bending and calculate the
tensile stress state ahead of the crack tip.
We follow the ASTM E 1820-01 Standard2 and model a three point single
edge bend specimen, as outlined in Fig. 9. We take advantage of symme-
try and model only half of the specimen, with a total of 24000 quadratic
quadrilateral plane strain elements. The J-integral is computed following
the ASTM E 1820 Standard,
J = Je + Jp (62)
with Je being computed from the remote load and the specimen dimensions
and Jp being calculated from the area below the force versus displacement
curve. A reference length scale R0 can be defined from the estimated value
of J as
R0 =
1
3π (1− ν2)
EJ
σ2Y
(63)
Crack tip stresses for a/R0 = 0.8 and W/R0 = 1.6 are shown in Fig. 10
for strain gradient plasticity (ℓ/R0 = 0.1) and conventional plasticity theory.

Toughness,” American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA.

Finite element results reveal that the elastic core is still present for the case
of J-dominance; the strain gradient plasticity prediction exhibits the elastic
1/
√
r singularity as r → 0. Thus short cracks, where small scale yielding
does not apply, also exhibit an elastic stress state near the crack tip.
5. Conclusions
We examine, numerically and analytically, the crack tip asymptotic re-
sponse in metallic materials. The solid is characterised by strain gradient
plasticity theory, aiming to phenomenologically link scales in fracture me-
chanics by incorporating the stress elevation due to dislocation hardening.
Results reveal that an elastic zone is present in the immediate vicinity of
the crack tip. The stresses follow the linear elastic r−1/2 singularity and the
plastic strains reach a plateau at a distance to the crack tip that scales with
the length scale of strain gradient plasticity ℓ. The dominant role of elastic
strains in the vicinity of the crack invalidates asymptotic analyses that ne-
glect their contribution to the total strains. The existence of an elastic core
is reminiscent of a dislocation free zone, as introduced by Suo et al. (1993).
The emergence of an elastic core has important implications on the on-
set of plasticity and the crack opening profile. Numerical predictions show
that strain gradient plasticity sharpens the crack opening profile to that of
an elastic solid. Differences with conventional plasticity are substantial and
results suggest that an experimental characterisation of the crack opening
profile could be used to infer the value of the length scale parameter. On the
other hand, plasticity is precluded if the remote load is not sufficiently large,
21
such that the plastic zone size (as given by, e.g., Irwin’s approximation) falls
within the elastic core domain.
In addition, we show that the inner elastic regime is also present when
the crack is small and an outer elastic K field does not exist. A generalised
J-integral is presented for strain gradient solids and the stress fields are
computed under J-dominance conditions in a three point single edge bend
specimen.
Finally, we note that the material length scale ℓ is on the order of a few
microns for most metals. This is roughly the smallest scale at which void
nucleation and growth occur, suggesting that the transition to an inner zone
dominated by elasticity will have important implications in quasi-cleavage
but play a secondary role in ductile fracture.
