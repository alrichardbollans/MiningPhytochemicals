A Snapshot of J. L. Synge

Abstract
A brief description is given of the life and influence on relativity the-
ory of Professor J. L. Synge accompanied by some technical examples
to illustrate his style of work.
1 Introduction
When I was a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor Synge in the School
of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies he was
fifty–one years older than me and he remained research active for another
twenty years. John Lighton Synge FRS was born in Dublin on 23rd. March,
1897 and died in Dublin on 30th. March, 1995. As well as his emphasis
on, and mastery of, the geometry of space–time he had a unique delivery,
both verbal and written, which I will try to convey in the course of this
short article. But first the basic facts of his academic life are as follows: He
was educated in St. Andrew’s College, Dublin and entered Trinity College,
University of Dublin in 1915. He graduated B.A. (1919), M.A. (1922) and
Sc.D. (1926). He was Assistant Professor of Mathematics in the University
of Toronto (1920–25), subsequently returning to Trinity College Dublin as
Professor of Natural Philosophy (1925–30) and then left for the University
of Toronto again to take up the position of Professor of Applied Mathemat-
ics (1930–43). From there he went to Ohio State University as chairman of
the Mathematics Department (1943–46) followed by Head, Mathematics De-
partment at Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh (1946–48) before

returning to Dublin to establish his school of relativity in the Dublin Insti-
tute for Advanced Studies. He officially retired when he was seventy–five
years old.
Synge was prolific, publishing 250 papers and 11 books. In 1986 he
wrote, but did not publish, some informal autobiographical notes [1], which
he described as being for his family and descendants and to aid obituary
writers, and which are deposited in the library of the School of Theoretical
Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.
Early in his career he published his first important paper: “On the
Geometry of Dynamics”, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A226 (1926), 31-106. Of
this work he said [1]; “I sent a copy to T. Levi-Civita`, and in return he sent
me a copy of a paper by him, just appearing. Our papers had in common
the equation of geodesic deviation, now familiar to relativists, but he had
done it using an indefinite line element, appropriate to relativity, whereas
my line element was positive definite.”
2 A Scheme of Approximation
Synge placed great emphasis on working things out for oneself, writing that
[2] “the lust for calculation must be tempered by periods of inaction, in
which the mechanism is completely unscrewed and then put together again.
It is the decarbonisation of the mind.” As an illustration of this activity
I give a weak field approximation scheme published in 1970 by Synge [3]
which has the advantage that it can be described without reference to an
2
example. This is a topic which, by 1970, had become a standard entry in
textbooks on general relativity and one might be forgiven for thinking that
by then the last word had been said on it.
We first need some basic objects and notation. In Minkowskian space-
time Synge liked to use imaginary time (which some people find maddening!)
and to write the position 4–vector in rectangular Cartesians and time as
xa = (x, y, z, it) with a = 1, 2, 3, 4 and i =
√−1,
with the index in the covariant or lower position. The Minkowskian metric
tensor in these coordinates has components δab (the Kronecker delta). If the
metric tensor of a space–time has components of the form
gab = δab + γab ,
then he defined the “truncated Einstein tensor” Gˆab via
Gab = Lab + Gˆ
ab ,
where Gab is the Einstein tensor calculated with the metric gab and
Lab =
1
2
(γab,cc + γcc,ab − γac,cb − γbc,ca)− 1
2
δab(γcc,dd − γcd,cd) .
The energy–momentum–stress tensor of matter giving rise to a gravitational
field has components T ab. With these preliminaries Synge’s strategy is as
follows:
(1) Given T ab, generate a sequence of metrics gab
M
= δab + γab
M
(M =
0, 1, 2, . . . , N);
(2) Approximations are introduced by expressing the components T ab in
terms of a small parameter;
(3) Integrability conditions, equivalent to the equations of motion, are im-
posed to terminate the sequence at a term which satisfies Einstein’s field
equations with a predicted order of approximation in terms of the small
parameter.
The sequence is constructed as follows: with
γ∗ab
M
= γab
M
− 1
2
δab γcc
M
(M = 0, 1, 2, . . . N) ,
3
and
H
M
ab = T ab + (8π)−1Gˆ
M
ab
(γ
M
) (M = 0, 1, 2, . . . N) ,
define the sequence {γab
M
} by
γab
0
= 0 and γ∗ab
M
= 16πKabrsH
rs
M−1
(M = 1, 2, 3, . . . N) .
Here Kabrs is an operator defined by
Kabrs = −δar δbs J + J(δar Dbs + δbsDar − δabDrs)J ,
with Da = ∂/∂xa, Dab = ∂
2/∂xa∂xb. The operator J is the inverse
d’Alembertian:
Jf(~x, t) = − 1
4π
∫
f(~x′, t− |~x− ~x′|)
|~x− ~x′| d3x
′ .
Synge proved that the integrals involved in the implementation of the op-
erator K converge if the physical system is stationary (T ab,4 = 0) for some
period in the past. He called this property J–convergence.
Approximations are introduced as follows: all {γab
M
} defined above satisfy
the coordinate conditions
γ∗ab,b
M
= 0 (M = 0, 1, 2, . . . N) .
Introduce approximations by assuming T ab = O(k) for some dimensionless
parameter k then
γab
M
− γab
M−1
= O(kM ) (M = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N) ,
from the definition of γab, and
Gˆ
M
ab − Gˆ
M−1
ab
= O(kM+1) ,
from the quadratic nature of Gˆab. To obtain a solution of Einstein’s field
equations in the Nth. approximation, terminate the sequence {γab
M
} at the
4
Nth. term by imposing the Integrability Conditions/Equations of Motion in
the Nth. approximation:
H
N−1
ab
,b ≡ T ab,b + (8π)−1 Gˆ
N−1
ab
,b = 0 .
Now
γ∗ab
N
= −16π J H
N−1
ab ,
and
G
N
ab + 8π T ab = O(kN+1) ,
showing that Einstein’s field equations are approximately satisfied in this
sense. This scheme was subsequently utilised for the study of equations of
motion in general relativity [4], [5], [6] and [7].
In an amusing spin-off Synge [8] constructed the following divergence–
free pseudo–tensor: first write the vanishing covariant divergence of the
energy–momentum–stress tensor in the equivalent forms
T ab|b = 0 ⇔ T ab,b +Ka = 0 .
Here Ka = Γ
a
cb T
cb + Γbcb T
ac is not a tensor (so the position of the index
a is not significant; Γabc are the components of the Riemannian connection
calculated with the metric tensor gab). Then define the pseudo–vector
Qa = JKa ⇒ Qa = Ka ,
(with J the operator introduced above and the Minkowskian d’Alembertian
operator) and define the pseudo–tensor
ϕab = Qa,b +Qb,a − δabQc,c .
It thus follows that
ϕab,b = Qa +Qb,ab −Qc,ca = Qa = Ka = −T ab,b .
Hence
τab = T ab + ϕab = τ
ba ,
is a pseudo–tensor with vanishing divergence (τab,b = 0). However Synge
offered, in his characteristic style, these words of warning: “I refrain from
attaching the words momentum and energy to this pseudo–tensor or to in-
tegrals formed from it, because I believe that we are barking up the wrong
tree if we attach such important physical terms to mathematical constructs
which lack the essential invariance property fundamental in general relativ-
ity.”
5
3 Lorentz Transformations
Synge gave a succinct description of his early education when he wrote [1]:
“Although there are great gaps in my scientific equipment - like Hadamard,
I could never get my teeth into group theory - I think I have ranged more
widely than most. I might easily have stuck to classical subjects in which
I was well trained as an undergraduate (dynamics, hydrodynamics, elas-
ticity), but I wanted to take part in the new subjects, and in due course
I mastered relativity but not quantum theory.” True to this background,
when considering Lorentz transformations, Synge thought of the analogy
with “the kinematics of a rigid body with a fixed point” (in [?]) and thus
the construction of a general rotation in three dimensional Euclidean space
in terms of the Euler angles. For Lorentz transformations the analogy re-
quires six transformations of an orthonormal tetrad to another orthonormal
tetrad, involving three pseudo angles (the arguments of hyperbolic func-
tions) and three Euclidean angles. While this perspective is interesting the
resulting formalism is not well suited to discussing the detailed effect of
Lorentz transformations on the null cone. In the second edition of his text
on special relativity Synge thanked I. Robinson and A. Taub “for pointing
out an error in Chapter IV of this book as first published (1955): singular
Lorentz transformations were overlooked.”
Taub was using spinors but Robinson had encountered the singular case
in a novel way [9, 10, 11]: Robinson was interested in the Schwarzschild
solution in the limit m → +∞. Starting with the Eddington–Finkelstein
form
ds2 = − r
2 (dx2 + dy2){
1 + 1
4
(x2 + y2)
}2 + 2 du dr +
(
1− 2m
r
)
du2
and, using a clever coordinate transformation, Robinson wrote this in the
form
ds2 = − r
2
cosh2 λξ
(dξ2 + dη2) + 2 du dr +
(
λ2 − 2
r
)
du2 , λ = m−1/3
Taking the limit λ→ 0 (⇔ m→ +∞) this becomes
ds2 = −r2(dξ2 + dη2) + 2 du dr − 2
r
du2
This is another (different from Schwarzschild) Robinson–Trautman [12] type
D vacuum space–time. The metric tensor has one term singular at r = 0.
6
This line element can be written in the form
ds2 = −T 4/3(dX2 + dY 2)− T−2/3dZ2 + dT 2
which is a Kasner [13] solution of Einstein’s vacuum field equations. If we
remove the term singular at r = 0 above we have a line element
ds2 = −r2(dξ2 + dη2) + 2 du dr
This is flat space–time and r = 0 is a null geodesic. Hence
ξ → ξ + a , η → η + b , u→ u , r→ r
where a, b are real constants, constitutes a Lorentz transformation leaving
only the null direction r = 0 invariant. This is a singular Lorentz trans-
formation (or null rotation) and the example moreover shows that such
transformations exist and constitute a two–parameter Abelian subgroup of
the Lorentz group.
4 Synge on an Observation of E. T. Whittaker
I mentioned at the outset that Professor Synge remained research active well
into old age. To demonstrate this I want to give an example of some work
carried out when he was eighty–eight years old. For several years, starting in
the early 1980’s, he and I found it convenient to correspond via letter. This
allowed easy exchange of the results of calculations before the age of email.
He typed his letters, including equations, on an ancient machine which he
had used for years. The example I want to give involves an observation due
to E. T. Whittaker and to do it justice I must first give a fairly extensive
introduction.
Whittaker (in [14], [15]) was concerned with the Lie´nard–Wiechert elec-
tromagnetic field of a moving charge e so we will need some notation which
we can briefly summarise as follows:
1) Line element: ds2 = ηijdX
i dXj = −dX2 − dY 2 − dZ2 + dT 2 .
2) World line of charge: Xi = wi(u) ; vi(u) = dwi/du with vi vi = +1
(⇒ vi = 4–velocity, u = arc length or proper time); ai = dvi/du = 4–
acceleration ⇒ ai vi = 0)
3) Retarded distance of Xi from Xi = wi(u):
r = ηij(X
i − wi(u))vj ≥ 0 ; ηij(Xi − wi(u))(Xj − wj(u)) = 0 .
7
Let Xi − wi(u) = r ki then ki ki = 0 and ki vi = +1. Parametrise the
direction of ki by x, y such that
ki = P−1
0
(
−x,−y,−1 + 1
4
(x2 + y2), 1 +
1
4
(x2 + y2)
)
,
and then the normalisation ki vi = +1 implies
P0 = x v
1(u) + y v2(u) +
{
1− 1
4
(x2 + y2)
}
v3(u) +
{
1 +
1
4
(x2 + y2)
}
v4(u) .
Whittaker observed that the Lie´nard–Wiechert 4–potential
Ai =
e vi
r
⇒ Ai,i = 0 = Ai ,
could be written, modulo a gauge transformation, in the form
Ai =
e vi
r
= KijF,j +
∗KijG,j ,
where Kij = −Kji is a constant real bivector, with ∗Kij = 12ǫijklKkl its
dual, and F,G are real–valued functions each satisfying the Minkowskian
wave equation
F = 0 and G = 0 .
To establish this in coordinates x, y, r, u we need

In coordinates x, y, r, u Whittaker’s two wave functions are [16]
F = −e

(two harmonic functions) and thus

.
Define
Kij = δi3 δ
j

− δi4 δj3 and Lij = δi1 δj2 − δi2 δj1 = ∗Kij ,
then
Ai = KijF,j +
∗KijG,j =
e vi

+ ηij Ψ,j ,
with
Ψ = e log{r P−1

√

Whittaker pointed out that this decomposition is analogous to the splitting
of a plane light wave into two plane polarised components. A notable fact
is that almost every vacuum Maxwell field can be resolved into two parts
in this way. The presentation of Whittaker’s observation in coordinates
x, y, r, u facilitates the derivation of the explicit decomposition (see [16]) for
the Goldberg–Kerr electromagnetic field [17]. The second, and final, part of
the introduction, to enable us to appreciate Synge’s contribution, involves a
simple proof of this decomposition of a vacuum Maxwell field in general.
We are working in Minkowskian space–time and we shall write the line
element as given above in rectangular Cartesian coordinates and time Xi =
(X,Y,Z, T ) with i = 1, 2, 3, 4. In addition we shall make use of the following
basis vector fields:
ki
∂
∂Xi
=
∂
∂Z
+
∂
∂T
, li
∂
∂Xi
= − ∂
∂Z
+
∂
∂T
,
mi
∂
∂Xi
=
∂
∂X
+ i
∂
∂Y
, m¯i
∂
∂Xi
=
∂
∂X
− i ∂
∂Y
.
All scalar products (with respect to the Minkowskian metric) of the pairs
of these vectors vanish except ki li = +2 and m
i m¯i = −2. In what follows
a complex self–dual bivector satisfies: Aij = −Aji and ∗Aij = iAij and a
complex anti–self–dual bivector satisfies: Bij = −Bji and ∗Bij = −iBij ,
with the star denoting the Hodge dual. A basis of complex anti–self–dual
bivectors is given by
mij = mi kj −mj ki , nij = m¯i lj − m¯j li ,
9
and
lij = mi m¯j − m¯imj + li kj − lj ki .
Let Fij = −Fji be a candidate for a real Maxwell bivector. Since Fij + i∗Fij
is an anti–self–dual complex bivector it can be expanded on the basis above
as
Fij + i
∗Fij = φ0 nij + φ1 lij + φ2mij ,
where φ0, φ1, φ2 are complex–valued functions of X
i. Maxwell’s Equations
(F ij + i∗F ij),j = 0 ,
imply integrability conditions for the existence of a complex–valued function
Q(Xi) such that:
(a) Q is a wave function: Q = 0 ⇔ m¯imj Q,ij = ki lj Q,ij ;
(b) φ0 =
1
4
kimj Q,ij , φ1 =
1
4
ki lj Q,ij , φ2 = −14 li m¯j Q,ij .
Let l¯ij denote the complex conjugate of lij , then l¯ij is self–dual. Define
Wij =
1
4
l¯i
pQ,pj − 1
4
l¯j
pQ,pi = −Wji .
Since Q is a wave function it follows that Wij is anti–self–dual. Expressing
Wij on the anti–self–dual bivector basis, and using (b) above, results in
Wij = Fij + i
∗Fij .
Hence with 1
4
l¯ij = Kij − i∗Kij and Q = U + iV , we can write
Fij = Ai,j −Aj,i with Ai = Kij U,j + ∗Kij V,j .
Thus in general an analytic solution of Maxwell’s vacuum field equations
on Minkowskian space–time can be constructed from a pair of real wave
functions U, V and a constant real bivector Kij = −Kji. The classic paper
on this type of result for zero rest mass, spin s fields is that of Penrose [18]
(see also Stewart [19]).
When I wrote out this proof (incorporated into [20]) and sent it to Synge
his response was characteristic. He worked it all out for himself and sent me
the following proof in December, 1985:
10
Synge’s proof begins with
Lemma: With Xi = (X,Y,Z, T ), ηij = diag(−1,−1,−1,+1), Fij = −Fji a
Maxwell field so that F ij ,j = 0 ; Fj,k + Fki,j + Fjk,i = 0 then
Fij = 0 at T = 0 ⇒ Fij = 0 for all T .
“You cannot make energy out of nothing” (Synge)
Corollary: If Fij and Hij are Maxwell fields then
Fij = Hij at T = 0 ⇒ Fij = Hij for all T .
With these preliminaries Synge stated the following:
Theorem: Given a Maxwell field Fij and
Hij = Ki
l U,lj +
∗Ki
l V,lj −Kj l U,li − ∗Kj l V,li ,
with Kij = −Kji = constants and U, V wave functions, then Hij is a
Maxwell field and there exists Kij , U, V such that
Hij = Fij at T = 0 .
Comment: Clearly Hij is a solution of Maxwell’s equations. The choice of
Kij , U, V is not unique. The theorem demands only their existence.
Proof: Choose Kij = δi3 δ
j
4
− δi3 δj4 then ∗Kij = δi1 δj2 − δi2 δj1 and writing out
Hij = Fij at T = 0 we find the following pairs of equations for the Cauchy
data U, V, U,4, V,4 for the wave functions at T = 0: (all equations evaluated
at T = 0)
(A): (U,4),1 = F13 + V,23 and (U,4),2 = F23 − V,13 ;
(B): (V,4),1 = F24 − U,23 and (V,4),2 = −F14 + U,13 ;
(C): U,11 + U,22 = −F34 and V,11 + V,22 = −F12 .
If the equations (A) are consistent and if the equations (B) are consistent
then (A), (B) and (C) can in principle be solved for the Cauchy data. The
consistency follows from the assumption that Fij is a Maxwell field since
then (A) implies that
(U,4),12 − (U,4),21 = F13,2 − F23,1 + V,232 + V,131 = F13,2 + F32,1 + F21,3 = 0 ,
11
and (B) implies that
(V,4),12 − (V,4),21 = F24,2 + F14,1 − U,232 − U,131 = F24,2 + F14,1 + F34,3 = 0 ,
and the theorem is established.
5 Epilogue
When visitors came to the Center for Relativity in the University of Texas at
Austin, Alfred Schild, the founder of the Center and one of Synge’s former
collaborators [21] would enthusiastically point out to them that this was
where Roy Kerr found his solution. This raises the question: what were
the stand–out works produced in Professor Synge’s school of relativity in
Dublin? I discussed this with George Ellis some time ago and we concluded
that Felix Pirani’s study of the physical significance of the Riemann tensor
[22] and Werner Israel’s proof of the uniqueness of the static black hole
(uncharged [23] and charged [24]) are arguably the most profound products
of Synge’s school.
When Synge turned ninety years of age a small conference was organised
in his honour. His status within Ireland was reflected in the report in a na-
tional newspaper which stated: “President Hillery [Head of State] attended
a special event in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies yesterday to
wish a happy 90th. birthday to Professor Emeritus J. L. Synge, Ireland’s
most distinguished mathematician of the present century. Although he has
been retired for fifteen years, the professor, a nephew of the playwright J.
M. Synge, published three papers last year and has two more at present in
the course of publication” [Irish Times, 23rd. March, 1987].
My photograph of Professor Synge (Figure 1 above) was taken in July,
1987 in my back garden. Also present were two of Synge’s former students,
Dermott Mc Crea (see [4], [5] and [7] for example) and Stephen O’Brien (of
the O’Brien–Synge junction conditions [25]) together with Bill Bonnor who
was visiting from the University of London.
