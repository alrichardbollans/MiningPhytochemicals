INTRODUCTION
The use of medicinal plants to treat several diseases is a usual 
practice that is increasing around the world. This knowledge 
has been used for finding bioactive secondary metabolites, 
contributing to the development of new drugs. Orchids are a 
large family of plants with around 25,000 species widespread in 
the world [1,2]. Orchids are mainly used as ornamental plants. 
Nevertheless, these plants have played an important role in 
ancient cultures medicine [3,4]. The research on orchids´ 
metabolites has been carried out with several species, resulting 
in the discovering of molecules with a widely chemical activity 
range [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In Mexico, orchids have been mainly 
used within the industries of regional handmade crafting and 
gastronomy, and in the celebration of religious rites, as well. 
Orchids are also used in other industries such as medicine 
as a component to manufacture narcotics, and for medical 
purposes[3,9]. 
The genus Prosthechea belongs to the Mesoamerican taxa which 
is composed of around 90 different species. It is proved that 
47 of these species are located in Mexico. Epiphytic plants, 
occasionally terrestrial, the pseudobulbs are comprised of an 
internode, single or on group, with 1 to 4 terminal and sessile 
leaves. These plants present an apical inflorescence, with few or 
numerous flowers, occasionally showy and with a conspicuous 
spathe [10]. In recent years, the pharmacological research on 
Prosthechea has increased due to the potential of these orchids 
mainly related to the antidiabetic activity, making Prosthechea 
michuacana one of the most studied orchids. Anti-diabetic, 
hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and healing 
properties have been reported to different organic extracts 
(n-hexane, chloroform, and methanol) and organs of the plant 
(leaves, pseudobulbs, rhizome, and roots) [11-17]. Furthermore, 
the hydroalcoholic extract of flowers, leaves, and pseudobulbs of 
P. karwinskii reduced the glycemic and lipidemic levels in Wistar 
rats with induced metabolic syndrome, which was attributed to 
the extract antioxidant capacity [18, 19].

ABSTRACT 
Phytochemical composition, antioxidant, and toxic effects of two orchid (Prosthechea cochleata and Prosthechea 
livida) were examined in their different hexane and dichloromethane/methanol extracts of leaves, pseudobulbs, 
rhizome and roots. Phytochemical screening reveals the presence of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, 
steroids and terpenes except for anthracene derivatives in P. livida and tannins in both species. Results showed 
exhibited significant toxicity against brine shrimp with an LC50 values ranged from 3 to 54 µg/ml in 24 h. Finally, the 
results of the antioxidant test in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that CH2Cl2:MeOH extract of P. cochleata 
root extract presented the most efficient protective antioxidant percentage (%PA), with 20 µg/mL, displaying a cell 
viability of 68.58%. In P. livida case, rhizome extract presented the most efficient %PA, with 1000 µg/mL, with a cell 
viability of 65.82%. The results evidenced the toxicity of Prosthechea cochleata and Prosthechea livida and reveals 
potential antioxidative of extracts.

In the North of Veracruz Mexico, several species of Prosthechea 
have been reported [20], among them P. cochleata and P. livida 
that we can find in abundance in the wild and in cultivation 
by people from the area. In some cases, they fall from the trees 
due to the heavy colonies or on the other hand they are knocked 
down for believing that they are parasitic plants. The present 
study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical compounds of 
different extracts and organs of Prosthechea cochelata and P. 
livida, followed by of the analysis of toxicity in brine-shrimp 
assay and the potential antioxidant activity in an induced H2O2
- 
yeast model oxidative stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Plant Material
P. cochleata (20o 26´ 46.9” N, 096o 22´ 36.2” W) and P. livida 
(210 18´ 16.4” N. 0970 51´ 05.4” W) were collected in February 
2016, in the North of Veracruz, Mexico. The specimens were 
identified by José Luis Alanís Méndez (PhD), School of 
Biological and Agricultural Sciences, Universidad Veracruzana, 
Tuxpan, Mexico. The voucher specimens were stored at the 
Universidad Veracruzana herbarium (Tuxpan, Veracruz), under 
the numbers Ver-Her-223-07-09(008) (P. cochleata) and Ver-
Her-223-07-09(009) (P. livida). The plants were divided into 
leaves, pseudobulbs, rhizomes, and roots. The material was 
properly washed, cut, and dried before pulverization in a grinder 
mill, and stored in amber jars at room temperature.
Plant Extracts
To perform the phytochemical analysis of each plant, the 
hydroalcoholic extracts were prepared separately using 30 g 
of the dried plant in 100 mL ethanol 70 %. Subsequently, 
they were sonicated during 5 min and subsequently placed 
into a water bath at 80°C for 5 min. Each extract was filtered 
in a Whatman N° 2 filter paper and stored in amber vials. 
For the pharmacological evaluations (In-vivo antioxidant 
assay and Brine shrimp cytotoxic assay) of nonpolar and 
polar metabolites, n-hexane and Dichloromethane:Methanol 
(CH2Cl2:MeOH) (1:1) crude extracts were prepared using 
100 g of a dried powder from parts of both plants and 100 mL 
of the solvent extraction by successive macerations (3x for 72 h, 
each), first with n-hexane and then with the halogen-alcohol 
solvent. After filtration, extracts were concentrated under a 
vacuum at 40 °C.
Phytochemical analysis
Classical chemical tests for screening alkaloids, anthracene 
derivatives, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, terpenes, 
and tannins were performed on the hydroalcoholic extracts 
using standard procedures reported by Wagner and Bladt [21], 
Harborne [22], Bruneton [23], Carvajal-Rojas et al. [24], Tiwari 
et al. [25], Herbert et al. [26], and Rivas-Morales et al. [27]. 
Alkaloids: 2 mL of hydroalcoholic extract was evaporated in 
three tubes. Add 3 mL of aqueous hydrochloric acid (10%). 
Heat it for few minutes in a bath water. After that, add 3 drops 
of Dragendorff, Mayer and Wagner reagents in each one of the 
tubes. A precipitate with/or turbidity confirm alkaloid presence.
Anthraquinones: 0.20 g of dry plant was suspended in 5 mL 
of chloroform by 15 min. Then, the chloroform extract was 
divided in two tubes. In one of them, add 1 mL of aqueous 
solution of sodium hydroxide (5%). A pink color in the solution 
show the presence of anthraquinone. In the second tube. Add a 
methanolic solution of magnesium acetate (0.5%). Red or yellow 
color in aqueous phase confirms anthraquinones. 
Coumarins: Put 2 mL of hydroalcoholic extract in a tube. 
Place a filter paper impregnated with sodium hydroxide (10%) 
in the mouth of the tube. Heat it in a bath water (100°C) for 
5 minutes. Take and dry the filter paper. Examined under UV 
light, yellow fluorescence being indicative of the presence of 
coumarins.
Flavonoids: In 2 mL of hydroalcoholic extract was added 
some fragments of metallic magnesium. Add a few drops of 
a hydrochloric acid (10%). After to 15 min, add 1 mL of amyl 
alcohol. The Amyl alcohol staining (yellow to red) is positive 
evidence for flavonoids.
Saponins: 5 mL of hydroalcoholic extract was evaporated in 
a tube. Was Added 5 mL of hot water. Cold the solution and 
shake, rest by 20 min. The presence of foam in the tube is 
indicative for the presence of saponins.
Steroids: 5 mL was dried and dissolved in 3 mL of chloroform. 
Was added 2 mL of a solution of acetic anhydride with 2 drops 
of concentrated sulfuric acid. A green coloration (sometimes 
blue, violet, pink or red) will be observed that turns to black 
with time, indicating the presence of steroids.
Triterpenes: 5 mL of hydroalcoholic extract was evaporated 
in a tube. Add 2 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and heated 
for about 2 min. A blood red-yellow coloration is positive for 
steroids.
Tannins: 5 mL of hydroalcoholic extract was evaporated in a 
tube. Then, the extract was dissolved with water and filter. 
Was added some drops of an aqueous solution of ferric chloride 
(10%). Blue colorations indicate the possible presence of 
hydrolysable tannins. Green colorations indicate the possible 
presence of condensed tannins.
In vivo Antioxidant Assay
This test was carried out using the yeast model reported by 
Golla and Bhimathati. [28], and followed the methodology 
described by Salgado et al. [29] with minor modifications. 
The yeast was grown in liquid yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) 
medium at 28°C to reach an exponential growth phase. 
The cells inoculum was placed in a 24-wells plates with the 
n-hexane and CH2Cl2:MeOH extracts at 1000, 500, 250, 100, 
50, and 20 µg/mL to a final volume of 1 mL and DMSO

concentration at 5%, which were incubated for 1 h. The 
treated cells with the extracts were stressed by addition of 
4mM hydrogen peroxide prepared in phosphate buffered 
saline (PBS) solution. Cell viability was calculated by counting 
colony forming units (CFU) with a cell dilution of 1:10,000 
seeded in YPD solid medium plates and incubated for 48h. 
DMSO (5%) with/without H2O2 4mM were assayed as controls 
for the antioxidant activity. Experiments were conducted in 
triplicate and reported as mean of cell percentage of survival, 
which represents the protective antioxidant activity (PA %). 
The cell viability after treatment with the extract (% CVE) 
during 1h and then exposed to H2O2 (% CVP) for 2h, following 
the formula: (100 / % CVE) x % CVP, was used to determine 
de PA%.
Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay
The toxic activity of the n-hexane and CH2Cl2:MeOH 
extracts was checked by the brine shrimp lethality test by 
Meyer et al. [30]. The n-hexane and CH2Cl2:MeOH extracts 
were dissolved in DMSO to final concentration of 5 % in 0.9% 
saline solution. The extracts concentrations at 1000, 500, 
250, 100, 50, 25, 5, and 1 µg/mL were evaluated in 96-well 
microplate in triplicate to a volume of 100 µL in sea water. 
The negative check 5% DMSO and the positive control of 
dichromate potassium dilutions were used. In each well 10 
nauplii (100 µL) were added, and the covered plate was 
incubated at 22-29 °C for 24 h. Plates were examined under a 
binocular microscope and the number of dead (non-motile) 
nauplii in each well were counted and recorded. 
Statistics Analysis
The antioxidant activity assay data were analyzed by one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey test 
for comparing the control and the assayed groups, using 
STATISTICA Version 7.0. Statistical significance was assumed 
at the level of 0.05. The results are expressed as mean ± 
standard deviation (SD). The mean results of brine shrimp 
mortality against logarithm of concentration were plotted using 
the Microsoft Excel computer program, which also presented 
regression equations. The regression equations were used to 
calculate the LC50 value. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The qualitative phytochemical screening of Prosthechea 
cochleata and Prosthechea livida showed that the hydroalcoholic 
extracts were positive for alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, 
saponins, steroids, and triterpenes, excepting for anthraquinones 
in P. livida, and tannins in both extracts (Table 1). The 
general phytochemical characterization of a plant belonging 
to this genera is shown in P. michuacana, where several 
constituents as: triterpenoids, stilbenes, phenolics, abietane-
type diterpenes from the pseudobulbs[12, 16, 17], and 
flavonoids in pseudobulbs [15] were found. Despite above-
mencionated, in P. karwinski several flavonoids have been 
isolated in pseudobulbs, flowers and leaves [18]. As we can 
see, the pseudobulbs and leaves of the orchids present a great 
diversity of chemical compounds that could be related to their 
main functions, which contain the accumulation of nutrients, 
response to environmental stimuli, and also play basic roles in 
plant growth [31]. 
The extracts of P. cochleata and P. livida showed toxicity against 
brine shrimp with an LC50 values ranged from 3 to 54 µg/ml 
in 24 h (Table 2). The toxicity of the extracts was considered 
by comparison to Meyer et al. [30] and Clarkson et al. [32] 
toxicity index where LC50 values of 500-1000, 100-500, and 
0-100 µg/mL were considered low, medium, and highly toxic, 
respectively. The values obtained in this work according to 
Meyer or Clarkson could be considered with high toxicity. 
The use of brine shrimp lethality assay to determinate the 
toxicity of plant extracts has been considered as a preliminary 
test [33]. This method is simple, reproducible and can be 
adapted to do in tube or in 96-well microplate. Several 
compounds, extracts or cytotoxic agents are toxic to brine 
shrimp due to sensitivity of this organism [34] (Sasidharan 
et al. 2008). Coe et al. [35] reported that extracts with 
presence of alkaloids were cytotoxic, causing brine shrimp 
death at LC50 concentrations below 2000 µg/mL, and the 
extracts without alkaloids the toxicity was due to terpenes.

In this study, all CH2Cl2: MeOH Prosthechea extracts were 
positive for alkaloids and other compounds resulting in the 
toxicity of this. 
The CH2Cl2:MeOH extract of Prosthechea species showed 
significant antioxidant activity in-vivo by increase the survival 
percentage of yeast cells against H2O2 (figure 1 and 2). In 
P. cochleata, root extract presented the most efficient protective 
antioxidant percentage (%PA), with 20 µg/mL, displaying a cell 
viability of 68.58%. In P. livida case, rhizome extract presented 
the most efficient %PA, with 1000 µg/mL, with a cell viability 
of 65.82%. The antioxidant activity represented by cell viability 
may be attributed to the presence of flavonoids observed in 
the phytochemical screening that were identified in roots 
of P. cochleata and rhizome of P. livida. In the case of Prosthechea 
michuacana four flavonoids were isolated by Gutierrez-Perez 
et al. [14]. 
CONCLUSIONS
Further studies will be necessary in order to elucidate the 
chemical constituents of the organic extracts of P. cochleata 
and P. livida, as well as their pharmacological properties 
of these molecules for a better understanding about the 
medicinal potential of these plants. In the present research, 
the results suggest that the extracts of P. cochleata and P. livida 
can be used as potential antioxidant on human health as 
hepatoprotective or anticancer drugs. These extracts also have 
toxic effects, and it will be necessary to develop further studies 
to prove their efficacy and safety of its components.
