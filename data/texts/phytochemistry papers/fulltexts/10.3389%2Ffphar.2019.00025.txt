The genus Adonis L. (Ranunculaceae), native to Europe and Asia, comprises 32
annual or perennial herbaceous species. Due to their cardiac-enhancing effects, Adonis
spp. have long been used in European and Chinese folk medicine. These plants
have been widely investigated since the late 19th century, when the cardiovascular
activity of Adonis vernalis L. was noted in Europe. The present paper provides a
review of the phytochemistry, biological activities and toxicology in order to highlight
the future prospects of the genus. More than 120 chemical compounds have been
isolated, with the most important components being cardiac glycosides as well as
flavones, carotenoids, coumarins and other structural types. Plants of the genus,
especially A. vernalis L. and A. amurensis Regel & Radde, their extracts and their
active constituents possess broad pharmacological properties, including cardiovascular,
antiangiogenic, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and acaricidal activities, and
exhibit both diuretic effects and effects on the central nervous system. However, most
plants within the 32 species have not been comprehensively studied, and further
clinical evaluation of their cardiovascular activity and toxicity should be conducted after
addressing the problem of the rapidly decreasing resources. This review provides new
insight into the genus and lays a solid foundation for further development of Adonis.

INTRODUCTION
The genus Adonis L. (Ranunculaceae), native to Europe and Asia, comprises 32 annual or perennial
herbaceous species and grows in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere (Ghorbani et al.,
2008; Orhan et al., 2017). The genus was named after the Greek mythological character, and Adonis
spp. have long been used in European and Chinese folk medicine for their cardiac-enhancing
effects (Abduchamidov et al., 1971; Felter and Lloyd, 2006). Due to the marked effects on heart
disease, researchers began focusing attention on the genus Adonis (Shikov et al., 2014). With
advancements in phytochemistry research, greater numbers of compounds were isolated from

Shang et al. A Review of Genus Adonis
the plants of this genus (Heyl et al., 1918); the compounds
exhibiting significant cardiovascular activity were primarily
classified as cardiac glycosides (Katz and Reichstein, 1947; Deng
et al., 1963; Chi et al., 1985). These reports further substantiated
the traditional uses of these plants for cardiac enhancement
(Shikov et al., 2014). Moreover, flavones, carotenoids, coumarins
and other structural classes were identified, and additional
pharmacological activities were found, including antiangiogenic,
antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, as
well as effects on the central nervous system, a diuretic effect and
acaricidal activity (May and Willuhn, 1978; Gu et al., 1980; Wang
et al., 1981; You et al., 2003; Das et al., 2007; Shang et al., 2012,
2013, 2017; Mohadjerani et al., 2014). These newly discovered
compounds and their previously unknown bioactivities advanced
and promoted the development of the genus Adonis (Yang et al.,
2015).
In the late 19th century, the cardiovascular activity of Adonis
vernalis L. distributed in the Eurasian region was observed. And
since the early 20th century, extracts of this plant enriched in
cardiac glycosides were prepared to treat chronic heart failure
in the former Soviet Union and Germany. In China and other
East Asian countries including Korea, and Japan, A. amurensis
Regel & Radde was studied and used to treat heart diseases in
the mid-20th century due to a shortage of cardiotonic agents
(Deng et al., 1963). Additionally, the toxicity of these plants
became apparent, and Adonis-induced poisoning cases in both
humans and animals were observed (Hurst, 1942; Galey et al.,
1996; Woods et al., 2004).
Until recently, researchers have made great advances in
studying the phytochemical and pharmacological activities of
genus Adonis. However, no review article discussing these
achievements is available in the literature. This review strives
for a complete overview of the existing botanical knowledge,
traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological research of
species belonging to the genus Adonis. Available information on
these species enables us to explore their therapeutic potential, to
highlight the gaps in our knowledge and to provide the scientific
basis for future research.
METHODS
As well as two reviews published by Kooti et al. (2016, 2018),
in this review we searched the information on this genus
from databases (using Elsevier, ACS, Springer, Wiley, Nature,
RSC, Medline Plus, Bentham Science, Hindawi Science, CNKI,
VIP, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Baidu Scholar)
and libraries, and the search languages were set to English
and Chinese. We didn’t set the time period for searching
more literatures. The keywords were searched as Adonis for
English literatures, Cejinzhan ( ) and/or Fushoucao ( )
for Chinese literatures. Three experts collected the literatures.
BOTANY
The generic name Adonis refers to the mythic character Adonis,
a lover of the goddess Aphrodite or Venus. Plants belonging
to the Adonis genus are native to Europe and Asia and have
been introduced to North America. It includes approximately
32 annual or perennial herbaceous species of flowering plants of
Ranunculaceae. In “The Plant List,” 143 scientific plant names
of species rank for the genus Adonis are included, and of these
32 are accepted species names (The plant list, 2013). Basal
and lower stem leaves are usually scaly and upper stem leaves
alternate and are palmately or pinnately divided. One-flowered
inflorescences terminate on branches or branchlets with absent
bracts. The flowers are radially symmetric, bisexual and usually
red, orange, or yellowish, having 5 to 30 petals. The plants possess
numerous stamens and spirally arranged pistils, linear filaments,
and one-ovuled ovaries with persistent styles and small stigma.
The plants have achenes, usually with raised veins, and the leaves
and roots are poisonous to humans and livestock (Heyn and Pazy,
1989; Gostin, 2011; Flora of China, 2018). Due to the beauty
of the flower, the plants of this genus were used historically
for ornamental purposes in some countries. Only in Germany,
the former Soviet Union and some East Asian countries some
species and their extracts were used as cardiac agents, especially
A. vernalis and A. amurensis (Table 1 and Figure 1).
TRADITIONAL USES
Adonis vernalis, known as the Bird’s eye, Pheasant’s eye or False
Hellebore, is a perennial, dry grassland plant species distributed
in the Eurasian region along a 4698-km longitudinal transect
from Russia to Spain (Hirsch et al., 2015). This species prefers
calcium-rich chernozem soils of various types but also grows
in meadow chernozems and gray forest soils (Poluyanova and
Lyubarskii, 2008). It is listed in the German Homoeopathic
Pharmacopoeia (Shikov et al., 2014). Historically, it was used to
treat edema by local people of the former Soviet Union. Extracts
of the plant were first introduced into medicine as a cardiac
stimulant in 1879 by the Russian medical doctor, N. O. Buhnow,
and A. vernalis has attracted the interest of many people ever
since. In 1898, a mixture of this medicine with sodium bromide
(or potassium bromide) or codeine was suggested to treat light
forms of epilepsy and heart diseases (Bekhterev, 1898; Shikov
et al., 2014). Over the intervening years, an ethanolic extract
of the aerial parts of A. vernalis was prepared as an alternative
cardiac agent in the former Soviet Union. The biological activity
of this extract was defined as 50–66 frog units or 6.3–8.0 cat units
(Chiang and Mi, 1958; Wagler, 2001). Now, in Russia, the aerial
part as a cardiotonic, was applied in the clinics for internal use at
the dose of 1 tablespoon of the infusion (7:200) 3–5 times per day
(Sokolov et al., 2000; Shikov et al., 2014).
Ten species are distributed in China. One thousand years
ago, plants belonging to the Adonis genus in China (Chinese
name: Binglianghua or Fushoucao) were recorded in the ancient
book “Gui Hai Yu Heng Zhi” written by Fan Chengda, a notable
historical figure from the Song dynasty. The well-known classical
book of Chinese materia medica, “Ben Cao Gang Mu,” also noted
the effect (Keshan Research Group of Jilin Medical University,
First Clinical College, Second Clinical College, Third Clinical
College of Jilin Medical University, 1977), and raw materials have

been used in folk medicine for the treatment of heart diseases
and edema (Bae, 2000). During the 1950s, due to the shortage
of cardiac agents, Adonis sp. distributed throughout China were
widely studied and developed. These efforts resulted in the
isolation and further study of the cardenolide-enriched extracts
of A. amurensis. After comprehensive pharmacological tests, the
extracts were prepared and developed in a new preparation
that was used to clinically treat human heart failure (Coronary
Disease Control Group of Liaoning TCM College’s Hospital,
1971). In 1975, the raw material of this plant was listed in the
Pharmacopeia of the People’s Republic of China (Committee for
the Pharmacopoeia of P. R. China, 1975). In Siberia, the aqueous

extract of the aerial parts was used to treat malaria, kidney disease
and other heart-related diseases (Utkin, 1931; Nosal and Nosal,
1960).
PHYTOCHEMISTRY
Since the first compound was isolated from Adonis plants in
the early 19th century, more than 120 compounds have been
isolated and identified to date. Fifty-four cardiac glycoside
compounds were identified as active components. Additionally,
flavones, carotenoids, coumarins and other compounds were
also isolated and reported (Table 2). The chemical structures of
active compounds isolated from the genus Adonis were listed in
Figure 2.
Cardiac Glycosides and Other
Glycosides
Cardiac Glycosides
Cardiac glycosides are important active compounds of the
genus Adonis. Since the extract of A. vernalis was introduced
into medicine in 1879, the increasing numbers of compounds
have been isolated and identified. In 1918, a method for the
preparation of an active digitalis-like glucoside from A. vernalis
was developed (Heyl et al., 1918). Cymarin (1), adonitoxin (2),
16-hydroxy-strophanthidin (3), acetyladonitoxin (4), vernadigin
(5) and 3-acetylstrophadogenin (6) were subsequently isolated
(Katz and Reichstein, 1947; Pitra and Čekan, 1961; Poláková
and Čekan, 1965). In 1965, a new glycoside, substance N (7),
was isolated from the leaves of A. vernalis (Büchner et al.,
1965). Additional isolated compounds include strophanthidine
fucoside (8), 3-epi-periplogenin (9), 17β-(2′,5′-dihydro-5′-
oxo-3′-furyl)-5β-14β-androstane-3α,5β,14β-triol (10), adonit
oxigenin 2-O-acetylrhamnosidoxyloside (11), adonitoxigenin
3-O-acetylrhamnosidoxyloside (12), adonitoxigenin rhamnosid
oxyloside (13) and cymarin (Franz, 1971; Wichtl
et al., 1972; Mathe and Mathe, 1979a,b; Junior
and Wichtl, 1980; Winkler and Wichtl, 1985).
Adonitoxigenin 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamno
pyranoside (14), adonitoxigenin 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-
(1→4)-α-L-(3′-O-acetyl)-rhamnopyranoside (15), adonit
oxigenin-3-[O-α-L(2′-O-acetyl) rhamnosido-β-D-glucoside (16)
and 17β-(2′,5′-dihydro-5′-oxo-3′-furyl)-5β-14β-androstane-3α,
5β,14β-triol (17) were also identified (Junior and Wichtl, 1980;
Winkler and Wichtl, 1986).
Adonis aleppica is endemic in Mesopotamia and southeastern
Anatolia and is closely related to A. vernalis, which is used as
a heart tonic. In 1985, 3-epi-periplogenine, periplorhamnoside
(18) and strophanthidin-diginoside (19) were isolated (Junior
and Wichtl, 1980). Subsequently, the first cardenolide-
sulfate uzarigenin-3-O-sulfate (20) was identified, along
with alepposides A (21), B (22), C (23), and D (24);
sarmentocymarin (25); and a glycosidic conjugate named
aleppotrioloside (26) that were also isolated from the whole

plant (Matthiesen et al., 1992; Pauli and Junior, 1993; Pauli,
1995).
Investigation of the chemical constituents of A. amurensis
roots has been on-going since the 1960s, with more than
20 pregnanes and cardenolides isolated and identified. In
1971, eight cardenolides were isolated by Ponomarenko et al.
(1971a), including cymarin (1), somalin (27), cymarol (28),
strophanthidin (29), strophanthidol (30), corchoroside A (31),
convallatoxin (32) and k-strophanthin-β (33). Subsequently,
digitoxigenin (34) and convalloside (35) were identified from this
plant (Shimizu et al., 1978; Yin et al., 2014). Kubo et al. (2015)
isolated five new cardenolide glycosides, amurensiosides L-P

(36–40). In 2003, antiangiogenic activity-guided fractionation
and isolation carried out on the methanol extract of A. amurensis
led to the identification of three compounds, namely, cymarin,
cymarol, and cymarilic acid (41) (You et al., 2003). Digitoxigenin
(34) was isolated from both A. vernalis and A. amurensis (Sato
et al., 1971).
Adonis aestivalis is an annual plant with a crimson flower,
distributed throughout southern Europe and Asia. Yatsyuk
et al. (1983) first investigated the epigeal phytochemicals
of A. aestivalis, which included strophanthidin and
k-strophanthidin-β. In 1992, four cardenolides were isolated
for the first time from the aerial parts of the plants, including
3-epi-periplogenin, helveticoside (42), strophanthidin-3-O-
β-D-digitoxosido-α-L-cymarosido-β-D-glucoside (43) and
strophanthidin-3-O-β-D-digitoxosido-β-D-digitoxosido-β-D-dig
inosido-β-D-glucoside (44); the first two compounds have
been isolated from other species as well (Kopp et al.,
1992). Kubo et al. (2012) has investigated the chemical
compounds in the seeds of A. aestivalis, and a new
cardenolide 3β,5α,14β,17β-tetrahydroxycard-20,22-enolide
(45) was found along with its two new glycosides 3β-[(O-β-D-
glucopyranosyl)oxy]-5α,14β,17β-trihydroxycard-20(22)-enolide
(46), and 3β-[(O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-
glucopyranosyl)oxy]-5α,14β,17β-trihydroxycard-20(22)-enolide
(47). A new strophanthidin hexaglycoside, strophanthidin 3-O-
β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-
D-diginopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-oleandropyranosyl-(1→4)-O-
β-D-digitoxopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-digitoxopyranoside (48), as
well as strophanthidin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (49) were also
isolated (Kubo et al., 2012).
A. multiflora is native to Korea, Japan, and Manchuria.
In 2015, amurensioside L (36) was isolated from the whole
plant (Baek et al., 2015). A. leiosepala yielded cymarin and
k-strophanthin-β (Evdokimov, 1979). These two compounds,
along with strophanthidin and convallatoxin, were isolated from
A. wolgensis (Komissarenko et al., 1973a,b,c). Strophanthidin,
cymarin, k-strophanthin-β, k-strophanthoside (50) and
adonitoxin were identified in extracts of A. chrysocyathus
(Aitova et al., 1971; Genkina et al., 1972; Yatsyuk et al., 1976).
Then, the related plant A. sibiricus afforded strophanthidin,
k-strophanthidin-β, convallatoxin and gxtuagoxin (51) (Zheng,
1975).
Lamzhav (1975) isolated cymarin, adonitoxin, corchoroside
A, k-strophanthin-β, k-strophanthoside, erysimoside (52),
olitoroside (53) and glucoolitoroside (54) from A. mongolica
(Thieme and Lamzhav, 1976). Komissarenko et al. (1977)
isolated the cardenolides strophanthidin, cymarin and
k-strophanthin-β from A. tianschanicus and A. turkestanicus.
Finally, somalin, cymarin, and Convallatoxin were identified in
A. pseudoamurensis (Ma et al., 1985).

Shang et al. A Review of Genus Adonis
Other Glycosides
Shimizu et al. (1967, 1969a,b) identified an aglycone-adonilide
(55); three novel compounds, namely, fukujusone, ester A
(56) and ester B (57); and the 18-norpregnane derivative
fukujusonorone (58) in A. amurensis. Adonilide (55),
fukujusone (59), 12-O-nicotinoylisolineolon (lineolon, 60),
12-O-benzoylisolineolonb (61) and fukujusonorone (58),
together with nicotinoylisoramanone (62), digitoxigenin, and
isoramanone (digipurprogenin-II, 63) were isolated from
A. vernalis and A. amurensis (Sato et al., 1971). Isolineolon (64)
was also isolated from this plant (Shimizu et al., 1978).
In 2010, five new pregnane tetraglycosides known as
amurensiosides A–E (65–69); two new pregnane hexaglycosides,
amurensiosides F (70) and I (71); two new 18-norpregnane
hexaglycosides, amurensiosides G (72) and H (73); and two new
pregnane octaglycosides, amurensiosides J (74) and K (75), were
isolated from the MeOH extracts of the roots of A. amurensis
(Kuroda et al., 2010). A new pregnane hexaglycoside was isolated
from the whole plant (Baek et al., 2015).
Flavones
Along with the isolated cardiac compounds, many flavones were
also identified. Adonivernith (luteolin-8-hexityl monoxyloside)
(76), homoadonivernith (77), orientin (78), homoorientin (79),
isoorientin (80), luteolin (81) and vitexin (82) were isolated from
A. vernalis (Chernobai et al., 1968; Drozd et al., 1971; Wagner
et al., 1975; Budzianowski et al., 1991), and adonivernith also was
found in A. leiosepala (Evdokimov, 1979).
Orientin, apigenin (83), luteolin, isoorientin and luteolin
7-glucoside (84) were isolated from A. coerulea Maxim.
(Zhang et al., 1991; Dai et al., 2010). Lamzhav (1975, 1983)
isolated luteolin, kaempferol (85), luteolin 7-glucoside,
and an orientin β-glucoside (86) from A. mongolica, and
luteolin, apigenin, apigenin-7-O-β-D-glucuronide (87),
orientin and isoquercitrin (88) were found in A. amurensis
(Yin et al., 2014). Orientin was identified from A. sibiricus
(Zheng, 1975). Komissarenko et al. (1973c) has identified
the flavonoid orientin from A. wolgensis, while the
orientin and adonivernitol were isolated from the herbs
A. tianschanicus and A. turkestanicus (Komissarenko et al.,
1973b, 1977).
Carotenoids
In 1965, astaxanthin (90), along with three minor red
compounds known as hydroxyechinenon (91), adonirubin
(4,4′-diketo-3-hydroxy-β-carotene) (92) and adonixanthin (3,3′-
hydroxy-4-keto-β-carotene) (93) were identified from the red
flowers of A. annua (Egger, 1965). Astaxanthin also was
found in A. amurensis (Zhang et al., 2015). 3,4-Diketo- and
3,4,4′-triketo-β-carotene (94, 95) were also isolated (Egger
and Kleinig, 1967b). The fatty acid components of the
ketocarotenoid esters, including esters of astaxanthin (96),
3-hydroxyechinenone (97), 3,3′-dihydroxyechinenone (98) and
3-hydroxycanthaxanthin (99) were also investigated (Egger and
Kleinig, 1967a). In 1981, the carotenoid composition of the
red flower petals of A. annua was elucidated and included
adonixanthin diester (100), 3-hydroxy-echinenone ester (101),
cis-astaxanthin diester (102), trans-astaxanthin diester (103),
adonirubin ester (104), cis-astaxanthin monoester (105) and
trans-astaxanthin monoester (106) (Renstrøm et al., 1981).
In1987, from A. aestivalis astaxanthin diester also was isolated
(Kamata and Simpson, 1987).
Coumarins
The two coumarins umbelliferone (107) and scopoletin (108)
were isolated from the roots of A. amurensis, A. wolgensis,
A. leiosepala, and A. mongolica (Ponomarenko et al., 1971b;
Komissarenko et al., 1973c; Evdokimov, 1979; Lamzhav, 1983).
Others
Mohadjerani et al. (2014) studied the fatty acids of A. wolgensis,
and the results showed that linolenic acid (45.83%, 109) and
oleic acid (47.54%, 110) were the most abundant fatty acids
found in the leaves and stems, respectively. Zhang et al. (1991)
found that stigmast-4-ene-3,6-dione (111), stigmast-4-ene-3-
one 6β-hydroxy (112), β-D-glucopyranoside (113), palmitic acid
(114), adonitol (115), and β-sitosterol (116) existed in A. coerulea.
1-Hentriacontanol (117) and p-formylcinnamic acid (118) were
also found in this plant (Dai et al., 2010).
A new tetraoside, sugoroside (119) was identified in the
extracts of A. chrysocyathus (Genkina et al., 1972), and the
pentahydric alcohol adonitol was found in A. mongolica and
A. leiosepala (Evdokimov, 1979). Five novel tri-, tetra-, and penta-
saccharides named adoligoses A-E (120–124), consisting of rare
dideoxy sugars and their 3-OMe ethers, have been isolated from
A. aleppica (Pauli, 1995).
Three lignans, namely, pinoresinol (125), pinoresinol-8-O-
β-D-glucopyranoside (126) and 9′-decarboxy rosmarinic acid-
4′-O-(1→4)-galactosyl rhamnoside (127), were isolated from
A. amurensis (Yin et al., 2014).
ANALYSIS OF ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS
AND QUALITY CONTROL
Due to the marked cardiac-enhancing effects, Adonis spp. have
long been used in European and Chinese folk medicine, and
some species, such as A. amurensis, have been historically applied
in the clinic to treat heart diseases. To examine the active
compound content in different parts of the plants and in different
species, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
other chromatographic methods were utilized. Wang et al.
(1991) reported that the highest content of total cardenolide
glycosides was found in the roots of A. amurensis during the
germination period with the lowest content levels isolated during
the mature fruit phase. Chromatography of cardiac glycosides
in A. amurensis used CH3OH: H2O (65:35) as the mobile
phase with an ODS column (150 mm × 6.0 mm) at a flow
rate of 0.80 mL/min monitored at 218 nm. The contents of
convallatoxin, strophanthidin, cymarin, and aglycones A and B
found in cardenolide-enriched extract were 6.58, 2.09, 2.54, 4.49,
and 2.11%, respectively, in a chloroform-ethanol (1:1) fraction
of an ethanolic extract (Gu et al., 1990). Liu and Cui (2007)
studied the content of convallatoxin of A. amurensis obtained
from various habitats throughout China. The results quantified

Shang et al. A Review of Genus Adonis
the contents of the aerial parts and roots harvested from Liaoning
province (0.0022 and 0.1400%), Jilin province (0.0019 and
0.1300%) and Heilongjiang province (0.0014 and 0.0790%). The
amounts of somalin, k-strophanthoside and k-strophanthin-β
in A. pseudoamurensis were determined to be 0.024, 0.13, and
0.071%, respectively (Gu et al., 1989).
PHARMACOLOGY
Cardiovascular Effect
In 1918, the cardiovascular effect and the toxicity was firstly
assayed using the 1-h frog method. Results showed that at the
concentration of 0.0045 mL/g frog of ten percent of 95% ethanol
extract of A. vernalis could result in a permanent systole (M.S.D.)
of the frog’s ventricle at the end of 1 h (Heyl et al., 1918). In the
early 1930s, Munch and Krantz (1934) reported that A. vernalis
and its preparations exhibited the same level of potency in the
heart as digitalis and the corresponding digitalis preparations
using the 1-h frog method. Studies by Benson and Edwards
(1941) showed that the pigeon emetic method is suitable for
the assay of A. vernalis, and the percent potency of tincture of
Adonis assays was 100% by the frog method, 91.6% by the cat
method, and 85.37% by the pigeon emetic method. Subsequently,
Lehmann (1984) studied the cardiac inotropic and constrictor
of SCOA (contained extracts from Scilla, Convallaria, Oleander,
and Adonis) in cats in vivo. At the dose of 21.5–100 GPU/kg
(GPU, guinea-pig unites), SCOA after intravenous injection had
a positive inotropic and constrictor effect on veins and arteries.
According to the studies of Turova and Sapozhnikova (1989),
the raw material of Adonis is as effective as Digitalis in the
heart failure accompanied by cardiac conduction disturbance;
but the effects are not cumulative and could not result in the
phenomenon of a cardiac arrest caused by Digitalis. Meanwhile,
substance N (7) from the leaves of A. vernalis exhibited a highly
potent digitalis-like mode-of-action, with a geometrical mean LD
of 0.1141± 0.0040 mg/kg in cats (Büchner et al., 1965). Moreover,
the potent antihyperlipidemic activity of the alcoholic extract of
A. vernalis also was found. At the concentration of 5 mg/kg, it
could significant decrease the serum cholesterol and triglycerides
compared with control, triton-induced hyperlipidemic control
and positive control (simvastatin, 20 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). And
it also slightly increased HDL, clear decrease in LDL and total
protein (Lateef et al., 2012).
Kuo et al. (1962) first studied the cardiac activity of
A. amurensis. The results showed that it has a similar effect to
A. vernalis, and it could enhance contractions of an isolated frog
heart and increase the contractions and diastole of an isolated
rabbit heart. After assaying for 20–30 min, the contractions and
diastole became weak, and the heartbeat stopped at the systolic
stage. Moreover, it enhanced the contractions of a dog heart
and increased the blood pressure while decreasing the venous
pressure of a heart in failure. Further electrocardiogram tests
showed that it extended the P-Q interval and shortened the R-T
interval, indicating that A. amurensis could influence metabolism
of heart muscle, enhance heart muscle contractions, delay
atrioventricular conduction and improve the overall function of
the heart.
Additionally, the effect of the cardenolide-enriched extract on
treatment of premature ventricular contraction was also reported
(Dong, 1981). To investigate the mechanism of action for treating
arrhythmia, the electrophysiology of rat cardiac muscle cells
was studied. The results showed that after injecting 0.5 mg/kg
cardenolide-enriched extract (0.5 mg/kg) in anesthetized rats
(10% urethane, 0.5 g/kg), the repolarization action potential
time limit (APD) lengthened, particularly at 90% APD, and
the conduction velocity of action potential was slowed (Gu
et al., 1981). When it was intravenously injected (0.1 mg/kg) in
anesthetized dogs, the dp/dt max value increased significantly
from 5 min to 30 min (p < 0.01), and this value was maintained
after 1 h. In contrast to the value of dp/dt max, the heart
rate of dogs significantly decreased (p < 0.001) immediately
after injecting the extract, and while the time lengthened, the
effect gradually weakened. Further studies showed the above
trends did not change with administration of a β-receptor
blocker, and this result indicated that β-receptor stimulation
and release of endogenous catecholamine are not factors in the
positive inotropic action of this extract. Additionally, the effect
of myocardial potassium loss promoted by the total glycosides
was presented in this research (Shi et al., 1979). The extract
also enhanced the antiarrhythmic activity of disopyramide (Shen
et al., 1983). To thoroughly exploit the resources of A. amurensis,
the cardiotonic activities of the ethanol extract of leaves, stems,
and roots were investigated. Results showed that all extracts
exerted cardiotonic effects on the movement of a rabbit atrial
muscle (Qin, 2000).
Deng et al. (1963) first proved that the total glycosides
of A. brevistyla, found in the Yunan province of China, had
cardiotonic effects. The results showed that injecting the total
glycoside preparation could stop the muscle contraction of Rana
pleuraden in the contraction phase when anesthetized with
urethane and could enhance heart muscle contractions of rabbits
after injections of 10% pentobarbital sodium. The LD50 value in
pigeons was 7.08± 0.15 mg/kg.
The cardiotonic effects of cardenolide-enriched extract of
A. pseudoamurensis on the heart failure of rabbits were studied
and found to significantly improve the heart function in
heart failure, while enhancing the dp/dt max, -dp/dt max, Co,
and Lvsp of the heart with increased rates of 210 ± 33%,
70 ± 17%, 191 ± 51%, and 31 ± 30%, respectively (Chi
et al., 1985). Oral administration of methyluracil lowered the
sensitivity to strophanthin both in rabbits with myocardial
infarction and in intact mice; intravenous administration of
methyluracil increased the coronary circulation rate (Lazareva,
1975).
Maham and Sarrafzadeh-Rezaei (2014) reported the
cardiovascular effects of A. aestivalis in anesthetized sheep.
The results showed that after intravenously administering three
successive equal doses (75 mg/kg) of the hydroalcoholic extract to
anesthetized sheep, the extract induced significant bradycardia,
hypotension, and various ECG abnormalities. Ventricular
arrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, atrioventricular blockage,
premature ventricular beats, ventricular tachycardia, and
ventricular fibrillation were observed. The acute intraperitoneal
toxicity (LD50) of the extract in mice was 2150 mg/kg. The
bradycardia and ECG alterations induced by the extract justified

Shang et al. A Review of Genus Adonis
the traditional use of this plant in treating cardiovascular
insufficiency (Table 3).
Antiangiogenic Activity
Adonis amurensis has been used in folk medicine for the
treatment of several diseases such as cardiac insufficiency and
edema (Bae, 2000), and the methanol extract was found to
exhibit strong inhibitory activity on human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) tube formation (Bae et al., 2000).
The antiangiogenic activities of three compounds, namely,
cymarin, cymarol, and cymarilic acid were studied. Among
three compounds, cymarilic acid exhibited strong inhibition of
human umbilical venous endothelial (HUVE) cell-induced tube
formation, with inhibition rates of 80–60% at a concentration of
1 µg/mL. Cymarin and cymarol exhibited the same inhibitory
activity against HUVE cells as the former compound (You et al.,
2003) (Table 3).
Cytotoxicity
In 2010, the cytotoxicity of four active compounds was
found. Amurensioside A, amurensioside B, amurensioside
D, and amurensioside E were moderately cytotoxic to
HSC-2 cells with IC50 values of 66, 26, 47, and 58 µg/mL,
respectively; the activity of the positive control melphalan
was 13 µg/mL (Kuroda et al., 2010). 3β-[(O-β-D-
glucopyranosyl)oxy]-5α,14β,17β-trihydroxycard-20(22)-enolide
(46), strophanthidin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-O-β-D-
glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-diginopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-
oleandropyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-digitoxopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-
D-digitoxopyranoside (48), as well as strophanthidin 3-O-β-D-
glucopyranoside (49) displayed selective cytotoxicity toward
malignant tumor cell lines including HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4,
and HL-60 cells with a CC50 range of 0.012–2.8 µM. Studies
also indicated that they may trigger caspase-3-independent
apoptotic cell death in HL-60 and HSC-2 cells. The CC50 values
of the positive control melphalan were 8.7, 25, 32, and 1.4 µM
in HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, and HL-60 cells, respectively (Kubo
et al., 2012). Five new cardenolide glycosides, amurensiosides
L-P showed cytotoxic activities against HL-60 promyelocytic and
HSC-2 cells (Kubo et al., 2015). Cymarin and cymarol showed
potent cytotoxicity against A549 cells (0.031 and 0.021 µg/mL)
while being inactive toward L1210 cells (5 µg/mL) (You et al.,
2003). Cymarilic acid showed no significant cytotoxicity against
the human solid tumor cell line A549 (ED50 > 5 µg/mL), and was
inactive toward murine leukemic cells L1210 (ED50 > 5 µg/mL)
(Table 3).
Effect on the Central Nervous System
In 1980, Gu et al. (1980) studied the effect of the cardenolide-
enriched extract of A. amurensis on the central nervous system
of rabbits. After injecting the extract (0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.v.)
in rabbits, the electroencephalogram (EEG) presented a high
amplitude slow wave, and the response of rabbits to sound
became weak. The sedative effect of the total glycosides may
be related to its inhibitory effect on the cerebral cortex and
the reticular structure. Additionally, the spontaneous electro
discharge in the neck was decreased, while the 5-HT content in
the brain increased significantly at a concentration of 0.5 mg/kg.
This result also showed that the glycosides induced peripheral
muscle relaxation. Moreover, injecting the extract (5–15 µg)
in the brain would stimulate the rabbits. Stimulation decreased
when scopolamine (2 mg) was administered to rabbits (Table 3).
Free Radical Scavenging Capacity
In 2014, the free radical scavenging capacity of A. wolgensis
in DPPH radical scavenging assay was studied. Total phenolic
content (TPC) of the hydromethanolic extract was 9.20 gallic
acid equivalents/g dry matter. Studies showed that the free radical
scavenging capacity of the hydro-methanolic extract had an IC50
value of 27.45 µg/mL, while the positive control ascorbic acid was
22.23 µg/mL. Additionally, the reducing potential of this extract
(measured at 0.05–0.6 mg/mL) showed a general increase in
activity with increasing concentration (Mohadjerani et al., 2014)
(Table 3).
Antibacterial, Anti-inflammatory, and
Antiviral Activities
The hydro-methanolic extract of A. wolgensis was particularly
effective against Gram-negative Salmonella enteritidis
(48 ± 1.56 µg/mL) and Escherichia coli (50 ± 1.94 µg/mL) and
against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (50± 1.83 µg/mL),
but no activity was observed against Gram-positive Bacillus
subtilis (Mohadjerani et al., 2014). Das et al. (2007) reported
a significant inhibitory effect by the 50% methanol extract of
A. vernalis on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in
whole blood cell culture. The 10% aqueous extract of A. vernalis
aerial part also presented the antiviral activity with inhibition
zone over 30 mm for Herpes virus Hominis HVP 75 (type2),
influenza virus A2 (Manheim 57), Vaccini virus and poliovirus
type1 (May and Willuhn, 1978) (Table 3).
Diuretic Effect
Wang et al. (1981) found that the cardenolide-enriched extract
of A. amurensis had a diuretic effect on dogs. After injecting
the drug (0.2 mg/kg) into dogs, the average amount of urine
measured increased to 178.03 mL versus 71.58 mL measured in
the control group. Na+, K+, and Cl+ outputs increased by 2.9-,
1.4-, and 1.9-fold compared to the control group, respectively.
These results indicated that the total glycoside preparation
has a significant diuretic effect by inhibiting the renal tubular
reabsorption of Na+, K+, and Cl+ (Table 3).
Acaricidal Activity
Adonis coerulea is a perennial plant with a height of 2–12 cm,
distributed throughout northeastern areas of Tibet and in
Sichuan, Qinghai and Gansu Provinces in China at altitudes
of 2300–5000 m (Chinese Materia Editorial Committee, and
State Chinese Medicine Administration Bureau, 2002). In the
field investigation of Sichuan and Gansu Provinces in China,
A. coerulea, as a traditional Tibetan medicine to treat animal
acariasis, was found (Shang et al., 2012). Further studies showed
that the extract presented marked acaricidal activity against
Psoroptes cuniculi with a median lethal time (LT50) of 3.137 h at a

Shang et al. A Review of Genus Adonis
concentration of 250 mg/mL in vitro, and it cured rabbit acariasis
after three treatments (Shang et al., 2013). The mechanism of
death in P. cuniculi involved the inhibition of the dynamic
equilibrium between the production and clearing of superoxide
anions, which destroyed motor function (Shang et al., 2017)
(Table 3).
TOXICITY
Animals consuming plants containing cardiac glycosides
typically develop fatal digestive and cardiac disturbances (Galey
et al., 1996), and many acute animal poisonings have been
attributed to the Adonis spp. cardiac glycosides since 1912. These
species include but are not limited to, A. aestivalis, A. annua,
A. amurensis, A. autumnalis, and A. microcarpa (Maiden, 1912).
The first experimental feeding trial was performed in 1929, and
the results demonstrated that A. annua was lethal to sheep when
fed 1.0 lb of fresh plant, the seed-bearing mature stage of the
plant and extracts of the partially dried plant. However, feeding
cattle 2 to 6 lb daily for 36 days failed to elicit clinical signs and
death (Hurst, 1942). In 1932, toxicosis in horses was reported
based on natural exposure to Adonis sp. (Degen, 1932; Kummer,
1952).
Woods et al. (2004) first reported Adonis toxicosis in North
America. After eating grass hay containing A. aestivalis, three
horses died. The signs of colic first appeared 24–48 h after initial
exposure to the hay, and gastrointestinal stasis and myocardial
degeneration of the horses were noted in subsequent clinical
examinations. In 2007, the toxicity of A. aestivalis in calves
was studied. Four Holstein and preruminating Jersey calves
were administered 1% bodyweight of A. aestivalis (containing
11–98 mg/g of strophanthidin) via a stomach tube and monitored
for clinical signs for 2 weeks and 1 week, respectively. The
Holstein calves were then fed 0.2–1% bodyweight daily for
4–5 weeks. They had transient, mild cardiac abnormalities during
the feeding trial, and mild transient gastrointestinal and cardiac
signs were also noted in the preruminating calves. The above
results showed that cattle are less susceptible than horses to
cardiotoxic effects and sudden death after ingestion of relatively
small quantities of A. aestivalis (Woods et al., 2007). Finally,
the toxicity of A. aestivalis in sheep (ewes) was investigated in
2010. Results showed that after administrating 1% bodyweight
to ewes for 24 and 48 h, the ewes all exhibited transient sinus
arrhythmias, and two of the three ewes exhibited transient
reduced fractional shortening. Moreover, after administering
0.2% bodyweight daily for 2 weeks, two ewes had reduced
fractional shortening after the low-dose treatment regimen. No
gross or microscopic lesions were seen when the ewes were
examined postmortem at the end of the study (Woods et al.,
2011).
In 1962, the toxicity of A. amurensis was first studied. After
perfusing the cardenolide-enriched extract intravenously, the
minimum lethal doses against cats and pigeons were 46.2 and
78.6 mg/kg, respectively (Kuo et al., 1962). In 1973, the toxicity to
cats of the total glycoside preparation of A. amurensis was studied
by observing the electrocardiogram, with results indicating that
the minimum lethal dose in cats was 0.75 mg/kg (i.v.), while the
minimum lethal doses of cedilanid and k-strophanthin were 0.77
and 0.49 mg/kg, respectively. The accumulative rates in body at
24 and 48 h were 74.2 and 23.8%, respectively, and at 74 h, the
accumulative rate was less than 5%. The above results indicated
the accumulative toxicity of the extract was lower than that of
digitoxin and convallatoxin, higher than that of k-strophanthin
(Shuguang Medical Team of Anshan City et al., 1973). The
minimum lethal dose in pigeons was 1.469 ± 0.201 mg/kg
(i.v.) (Shi et al., 1979). Acute toxicosis in mice and cats was
also observed after intravenous administration of Adonis-like
glycosides and the strophanthidin aglycone in the laboratory
(Chen et al., 1951; Greeff and Kasperat, 1961).
Davies and Whyte (1989) found that feeding the seed of
A. microcarpa (5.6 g/kg) induced total feed refusal within 3 days
in growing and mature pigs, causing vomiting, rapid and shallow
breathing, and even one pig died. These effects were probably
caused by the cardiac glycosides and subsided within 2 weeks
of removal of the seed. The toxicities of active compounds
also were studied. The LD50 of cymarin after intravenous
injection in rats and cats were 24.8 and 95.4 mg/g, respectively
(Chen et al., 1942; Vogel and Kluge, 1961); and the LD50
for adonitoxin was 191.3 µg/kg (Chen and Anderson, 1947).
Meanwhile, the average minimum dose producing a permanent
systole (M.S.D.) values for above two compounds were 0.621
and 0.88 g/g frog, respectively (Chen and Anderson, 1947). After
continuous intravenous infusion in dogs, the minimal lethal
doses of adonidoside and adonivernoside at 30 min were found
to be 0.7 and 1.75 mg/kg, respectively, and when they were
used together, the LD50 was 1.14 mg/kg (Lenel-Pekelis, 1949).
Kovaříková and Chen (1965) studied the activities of 16-hydroxy-
strophanthidin, 16-formyloxy-strophanthidin, acetyladonitoxin,
and tetracetyladonitoxin, and results showed that the LD50 in cats
were 1.121, 0.1518, 0.3881, and 4.397 mg/kg, respectively.
In China, cases of A. amurensis poisoning in humans who
misused or overdosed the plant have been noted. In most cases,
the patient heart rate was seriously abnormal (Wang and Feng,
1982; Sun, 1988; Zhang, 1999).
CONCLUSION AND REMARKS
Because of the marked effects as a cardiotonic agent in treating
heart diseases, some species of the genus Adonis L. and their
extracts have been widely used clinically in some countries,
including the use of A. vernalis and A. amurensis in Russia and
China. To provide a comprehensive review, the information on
this genus was gathered via the internet and libraries, and the
search languages were set to English and Chinese. The native
languages of some articles (written in Bulgarian, Russian and
German) as well as other factors including older publication
dates and the absence of an English abstract made it impossible
for us to cite and understand some articles. Although the
pharmacological effects of this plant were widely studied in Russia
before 1950s, much of the relevant literature is hard to access
(Shikov et al., 2014). As a result, some older studies published in
various languages were not included in this review and should be
examined and reviewed further. Recently, the review of botany,
traditional use, phytomedicine, pharmacology and toxicity of

Shang et al. A Review of Genus Adonis
A. vernalis provides comprehensively information for this plant
used in Europe (Latté, 2018).
According to the website www.theplantlist.org, 32 species
from the genus were accepted as native to Europe and Asia.
However, with the exception of A. vernalis, A. aestivalis, and
A. amurensis, the phytochemistry and the modern pharmacology
of most of the species have not been investigated comprehensively
and clinically validated. Although A. vernalis has been become
a well-known herbal medicine for cardioprotection, especially in
Russia, Bulgaria, etc. (Popiliev et al., 1973; Sorokina, 1989; Wichtl,
1990), only small numbers of in vitro and in vivo studies on
their cardioprotective effects are available (Popiliev et al., 1973).
Considering that some clinical studies assayed about 50 years old
are not valid anymore, the development of this genus should be
paid more attention.
To date, more than 120 chemical components have been
isolated and identified from the genus Adonis. With the
exception of the cardiac glycosides, some well-known flavones
in the genus also were isolated and identified with the wide
pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-microbial,
anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and
anti-allergic properties, and these compounds should be paid
more attention (George et al., 2017; Aziz et al., 2018; Guo et al.,
2018; Kim et al., 2018).
Additionally, A. vernalis is a medicinal plant whose
above-ground parts at the flowering or fruiting stages are
harvested from the wild as a raw material for the pharmaceutical
industry in China. In the past century, with the abundant use
of A. vernalis as well as a lack of xerothermic habitats and slow
plant growth among others, this resource has rapidly decreased
and is close to extinction (Lange, 2000; Baier and Tischew, 2004;
Denisow et al., 2014). Meanwhile, owing to the weak germination
of the seeds and the slow growth intensity of the plants, the
cultivation is unsuccessful (Galambosi, 1980a,b). Since 1982, it
has been protected in several countries and the trade of this plant
was banned in many East European countries (Lange, 2000).
Therefore, investigation of sustainable usage practices is still
necessary. This introduces the urgent problem of cultivation on
a commercial scale, which would be useful for its conservation
(Poluyanova and Lyubarskii, 2008).
In short, the phytochemical and pharmacological studies
of the genus Adonis L. have received much interest. Extracts
enriched in cardiac glycosides have been developed, and
active compounds have been isolated and proven to provide
cardioprotective activity. However, plants of this genus should be
studied and developed further, with particular attention paid to
conservation of resources and clinical testing.
