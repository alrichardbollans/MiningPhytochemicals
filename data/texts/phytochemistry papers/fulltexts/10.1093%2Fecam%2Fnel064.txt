Ayurveda, the system of traditional medicine from India, holds that ‘Rasa’, a concept roughly
corresponding to taste, is a basis for identifying pharmacological properties of plants and other materia
medica used in Dravyaguna—its system of phytomedicine. This idea has recently found support in
studies of ibuprofen, the pharmacological properties of which are similar to those of oleocanthal,
because the two substances have very similar tastes. This paper discusses a possible scientific approach
to understanding the Ayurvedic (hypo)thesis in terms of the stereochemical basis of both pharamaco-
activity and taste, and the numbers of possible pharmaco-active compounds that ‘Rasa’ may be able to
distinguish. We conclude that molecules binding to a specific enzyme active site should have their own
‘Rasa’, and that the number of different subjectively experienced ‘tastes’ is more than enough to
distinguish between molecular shapes binding to all enzyme active sites in the body.

scientific reports noting common pharmacological activity for
compounds with similar taste. As such, it is consistent with the
suggestion in traditional Ayurveda that substances’ similarities
of ‘Rasa’ may indicate similar pharmacological activity (2).
At this time, Ayurveda (3) and its core concepts are being
increasingly subjected to scientific scrutiny (4,5). Their scien-
tific robustness is becoming better appreciated (6,7), hence an
evaluation of Ayurveda’s means of drug identification. The
Sanskrit word ‘Rasa’ is usually rendered into English as ‘taste’
for want of a better word, but it possesses a deeper and more
subtle meaning. Rasa refers to the total subjective experience
arising from putting the substance in the mouth, including
not only the six primary tastes recognized by Ayurveda
(sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent), but also the
‘flavours’ experienced by means of retronasal olfaction (nasal
smell receptor stimulation by food warmed in the mouth), the
more acrid, chemesthesis irritation sense referred to above, and
even more subtle associations available to rare individuals
such as the ancient rishis of the Vedic civilization. The
latter notwithstanding, ‘Rasa’ refers to a complex totality of
experience arising from all the perceptory interactions of the
material with sensors in the mouth and nasal passages, taste
buds, olfactory and chemesthetic receptors. At a simple level,
the six Rasas are said to respond in a precise way to particular
qualities, or ‘panchamahabhuttas’, of plant material tasted (see
Fig. 1). Identification of pharmacoactivity would require a
far greater sensitivity, the basis for which we consider in this
commentary.
Over the past five millennia or more, oriental traditions of
medicine such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine
have identified and prepared large numbers of effective
therapeutic preparations, as modern scientific evaluations of
their efficacy amply demonstrate (8). How they were able to do
so is not at all understood. If it were, it might well assist in
future identification of potential sources of drugs. Ayurveda’s
claim that ‘Rasa’ provides an effective means of identification,
though seemingly simplistic, merits deeper scientific analysis,
to see what substance there may be to it. It is apparently
supported by the comparison of Oleocanthal and Ibuprofen.
Other support comes from Heinrich (9) who states that their
combination of taste and smell are important selection criteria

them—a point consistent with Ayurveda’s position. Further
support may come from sensory anthropology: Shepard (10)
states that sensation has been explored as a fruitful but poorly
examined domain of cross-cultural research, commenting that
the role of the senses in medicinal plant therapy has benefited
greatly from theoretical insights gleaned from sensory science.
Fischer(11)hasworkedextensivelyonthepsychologyoftaste,
correlating taste thresholds and just-noticeable-differences
with psychopathology, and reasons for differing taste
sensitivities at different periods of life. This commentary
presents a deeper analysis of the molecular biology of ‘taste’
to examine its possible scientific basis.
To pursue Ayurveda’s thesis further, a molecule’s ‘Rasa’
must be related more precisely to its biochemical structure,and
then to its pharmacological properties. As stated above, we
shall consider the total subjective experience of taste, ‘Rasa’,
to include, first, the properties of taste experienced through
taste buds in the mouth and their corresponding neural path-
ways to the brain (12), second, olfactory sensations, generated
retronasally after food has been warmed in the mouth, and,
third, the chemesthetic sense. Identities of Ayurvedic ‘Rasas’
thus have contributions from all of these. We first consider
taste and smell separately, and then combine them.
The number of independent contributions to the sensation of
taste is a complex question. The classic kinds of taste through
taste bud are sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami (13), but it
is accepted that there are more ‘subjective dimensions’ to
taste than these. In addition there are sensations of: ‘hot’ (or
‘pungent’) as in mustard or chili, astringent as in turmeric,
alkali, metallic and meaty taste sensations (14), and the
chemesthetic (or trigeminal) sense. For these, there are no taste
buds, so other pathways transmit their information to the
brain. A reasonable estimate of the number of independent
dimensions to the subjective sensation of taste (without regard
to olfaction) is therefore 10.
With regard to smell, Buck and Axel (15–17) identified a
multigene family of transmembrane olfactory receptor proteins
with over 1000 members, of which up to 300 may be active in
humans. [In addition, Dulac and Axel identified a different
multigene family encoding putative pheromone receptors in
the vomeronasal organ (18).] While it is true to say that many
structurally different molecules may stimulate any given
receptor protein, and that many proteins may be stimulated
bya givenmolecularspecies,thismultiplicitybeginstoexplain
animals’ extraordinary olfactory sensitivity. Primates distin-
guish many enantiomer pairs (19). Bees (20), rats and dogs can
detect specific molecules in explosives (21) and contraband
(22), while dogs can sniff out bladder cancers from urine
samples (23). Such specificity alone supports the idea that the
olfactory sense of a suitably sensitive person could distinguish
between different molecules bindingto different enzyme active
sites, i.e. with different pharmacological activity.
In the case of the sense of sight, there are three well-
characterized photosensitive molecules, yielding different,
overlapping absorption spectra in the ‘red’, ‘green’ and ‘blue’
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The physics of
how these combine to yield a visual sensitivity capable of
discriminating some half a million color mixtures (mostly in
‘earth’ and ‘forest’/‘grassland’ shades) is well understood and
the basis for all color engineering applications, e.g. the original
Polaroid instant color-print camera.
How the corresponding engineering problem works for the
combination of gustation and olfaction constituting ‘Rasa’ is
not so well characterized. The dimensionality analogous to the
number for color vision is clearly much larger, and should
yield a correspondingly greater number of discriminatable
values. To the 10 dimensions identified for gustation, must
be added the number for olfaction. The problem in estimating
the number of olfaction dimensions is that, although the
number of genes and corresponding transmembrane proteins in
the olfactory epithelia (and vomeronasal organ) is large, they
are not where olfactory cognition and discrimination take
place. That is in the olfactory cortex, with its complex,
multilayer processing, not dissimilar to that in the visual
cortex. The number of dimensions is given by the number of
distinct kinds of neural signal transmitted from olfactory
receptor cells to the olfactory cortex, a number not necessarily
equal to the number of kinds of receptor proteins, for if
different receptor proteins in the olfactory epithelia lead to
identical, or sufficiently similar, signals being transmitted to
the olfactory cortex, their difference will not increase olfactory
discrimination. Indeed, it is possible that the reason for the
large number of different olfactory receptor proteins is to
increase the number of different molecules that will produce
a signal, and be detected, and not necessarily to increase
olfactory discriminatory ability. The aim may be to increase
overall sensitivity, rather than discrimination.
In estimating the subjective dimensionality of olfaction, we
therefore need to look further for some other clue. Another

Figure 1. The figure shows one relationship between taste and physiological
propertyproposed in Ayurveda, using its various classifications of matter, taste
and organism regulation: the five qualities attributed to condensed matter
(Panchamahabhutta) mediate between the six tastes (Shadrasa) and the three
principle classes of organism regulation (Tridosha). The Tridosha are seen as
emerging from the Panchamahabhutta as life animates condensed matter,
while the Shadrasa are sensory attributes of each of the Panchamahabhutta,
permitting them to be experienced through the five senses (or
Panchagyanendriya—not depicted).
146 Traditional phytochemistrysource of information for the number of distinguishable signals
a single organ can transmit to the brain is the number of
distinct ways organ health is monitored and compensated (24).
Grakov (25) has shown that organs transmit to the brain up to
15 distinguishable kinds of neural signal concerning their state
of health, and that the brain can accurately and reproducibly
estimate 50–60 levels of magnitude for each such signal. These
are not consciously cognized, and only appear as a secondary
effect in impairments to visual, color discrimination. Color
discrimination is similar, three dimensions including gray
scale lead to an ability to discriminate 5 · 10
5 colors or
80 per dimension. Most organs transmit at least 10 distinct
signals of this kind (24). A reasonable lower bound for the
number of classes of variable magnitude neural signal the
olfactory cortex cognitively discriminates is therefore between
5 and 10. Combining the estimates of taste and smell
dimensionality yields a conservative estimate of 15–20 for
the dimensionality of ‘Rasa’.
How can these be used to estimate the number of dis-
criminatable ‘Rasa’ sensations? For smell, it is recognized
that inexperienced subjects can only distinguish four levels of
smell intensity: none–weak–moderate–strong. (12, p. 137).
Since our concern is lower limits, this may be used for the
sensitivity of each of the estimated 15–20 dimensions: four
levels of sensitivity for each dimension (cf. 50–60 for organ
health). If, in identifying a substance’s ‘rasa’, the brain
assesses the stimulation of all taste and smell receptors, then,
even with only four intensity levels, the 15–20 dimensions
yield 4
15–4
20 separately identifiable Rasas. This is between
1 billion and 1 trillion (10
9–10
12).
Now consider ‘taste’ pharmacologically, in terms of active
sites to which binding may occur. Molecules bind to an
enzyme active site because their conformation including size
and shape are correct, and their chemical moieties are in the
right places to produce binding. Such properties are all but
identical to those enabling a molecule to bind to smell and taste
receptors, and so acquire its specific ‘Rasa’, or subjectively
identified taste: in smell receptors, a molecule’s specific size
and shape activate the receptor, while in taste receptors
specific chemical reactivity may be more involved.
Given that the criteria for molecules to bind to specific
enzyme active sites are so similar to criteria for their binding to
taste and smell receptors in the mouth and nasal epithelia, it is
difficult to conceive that a molecule capable of binding to a
particular site either as a substrate or a drug would not possess
a different ‘Rasa’ from another molecule binding to a different
enzyme active site. Two such sites would have tobe differently
structured in order to bind their two natural molecular
substrates appropriately, so the proposal that a combination
of ‘taste’ and ‘smell’ should be able to distinguish the two
seems plausible.
To express this quantitatively: the number of identifiable
‘tastes’, conservatively estimated above at 10
9–10
12, is far
greater than the number of active sites of all the enzymes in the
human body. Each such site probably has its own identifiable
‘Rasa’ taste. Rasa provides enough potentially available
information to distinguish molecules of all possible pharma-
coactivities acting on the physiology, though, of course, some
active sites may be so similar that tastes of molecules binding
to them are indistinguishable.
Conclusions
Notwithstanding such complications, Ayurveda’s correspond-
ence of ‘Rasa’ with pharmacological activity assumes a
new significance: instead of being too limited to distinguish
all the kinds of molecule that may influence the functioning
of enzyme active sites, it should be capable of doing so. It
is therefore possible that Ayurveda’s traditional approach
could provide new leads in phytochemical drug discovery.
Using ‘taste’ as an additional tool, new phytochemicals of
desired therapeutic activity might be more rapidly identified.
Of course, though this reasoning provides corroborative
support for one aspect of Ayurveda, it still does not solve the
riddle of how the ancients identified the pharmacoactivities of
so many species of plant, their relative potency and individual
properties. That remains an open question for further
investigation.
Though Beauchamp et al. (1) did not refer to the traditional
concept of identification of pharmacoactivity through taste;
their observations support it and offer new directions to
research validating traditional concepts and medicines. Their
work may also facilitate the possibility of discovering new
drugs based on traditional knowledge (26). It also supports the
thesis that complementary medical systems can be of rigorous
scientific value (27), in particular that some of Ayurveda’s
unique concepts are worth examining in depth for their
implications for biology and medicine (28).
