AbstrAct 
Plant species belonging to the Ocimum genus are among the most popular medicinal plants and are being used for 
several purposes in ethnomedicine. Ocimum is universally cultivated; however, the geographical distribution highlights 
three major centers of Ocimum diversity: the tropical areas of America, the tropical region of Asia, and the tropical and 
subtropical regions of Africa. Ocimum species have been employed traditionally for several medicinal purposes, including 
antioxidant, antibacterial, hypoglycaemic, hepatoprotective, antiviral, and other medicinal purposes. Though scientists 
have carried out studies and chronicled the pharmacological potentials of Ocimum species, documents containing these 
data seem to be disassembled, making it difficult to really distinguish the pharmacologically beneficial species from those 
that are not and also to get comprehensive information about the medicinal species in this genus. Hence, this review 
aims to outline classified information on the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacological importance 
of some Ocimum species that have been different researchers have reported In carrying out this review, the literature 
search was done via relevant databases including PubMed, Springer, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, SciFinder, 
Google Scholar, and Scopus. The species reviewed are the most widely used from the Ocimum genus in traditional 
medicine, and they are also the most researched for intended use in conventional therapeutic practice. Literature 
reveals that these species contain several compounds responsible for the numerous pharmacological activities elicited 
by them, including antimalarial, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects.

IntroductIon
In the past few years, scientists and researchers have focused mainly on natural products searching for potent and safer agents for 
curative, prophylactic, and other medicinal 
purposes.[1] This has led to extensive scientific 
studies on suspected medicinal plants and other 
natural products. [2] Scientific chronicles have 
shown that remarkable success has evolved 
from this trend, as several pharmacological 
agents currently in use were developed from 
natural products (including plants).[3]
Plant species belonging to the Ocimum genus 
are among the most popular medicinal plants 
and are being used for several purposes in 
ethnomedicine. Of the entire genus stemming 
from the subfamily Nepetoideae (under the family 
Lamiaceae), Ocimum (also known as Basil) is 
the most important.[4] The name Ocimum was 
derived from the word “Ozo” (Greek), which 
means smell.[5] Due to its enormous use 
in traditional medicine and pharmaceutical 
industry and perfumery purposes, it is also 
referred to as the “king of herbs.” [6] According 
to the report documented by Pushpangadan 
and Bradu, the genus Ocimum with over 160 
species, is said to be the largest genera belonging 
to the Lamiaceae family.[7]  About 65 of the 
species are native to Ocimum, while the others 
are considered synonyms.[1, 7] Ocimum is 
universally cultivated; however, the geographical 
distribution highlights three important centers 
of Ocimum diversity. These are the tropical 
areas of America, the tropical region of Asia, 
and Africa’s tropical and subtropical regions. 
The African tropical rain forest has the highest

number of Ocimum species.[8] The main species 
of Ocimum with documented pharmacological 
activity include Ocimum gratissimum, Ocimum 
basilicum, Ocimum sanctum, Ocimum 
americanum, and Ocimum Kilimandscharicum. 
These species have been reported traditionally 
to possess different culinary and medicinal 
activities. In different parts of the world, people 
employ plant species from this genus for several 
medicinal purposes such as antioxidant, 
antibacterial, hypoglycaemic, hepatoprotective, 
antiviral, and several other medicinal purposes. 
[9 - 12]  Though scientists have carried out 
studies and chronicled the pharmacological 
potentials Ocimum, documents containing these 
data seem to be disassembled, making it difficult 
to really distinguish the pharmacologically 
beneficial species from those that are not and 
also to get comprehensive information about 
the medicinal species in this genus.  Hence, this 
review aims to outline classified information on 
the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and 
pharmacological importance of some Ocimum 
species that have been different researchers 
have reported
In carrying out this review, the literature search 
was done via relevant databases, including 
PubMed, Springer, Web of Science, Science 
Direct, Embase, SciFinder, Google Scholar, and 
Scopus. The keywords used for the search include 
Ocimum, Ocimum species, phytochemical, 
phytochemistry, pharmacological activity, 
pharmacological evaluation of extracts, 
fractions, or isolated compounds from Ocimum. 
The study’s selection and inclusion were based 
on publications done in the English language 
only. All selected manuscripts were analyzed for 
relevance to the topic, reported plant species, 
isolated chemical compounds, and evaluated 
biological activities.
Ethnopharmacology of Ocimum species

Phytochemical Studies
Ethnomedicinal plants contain complex plant 
chemicals, also known as phytochemicals. 
These phytochemicals are made up of several 
compounds. The enormous information revealed 
by the ethnomedicinal applications of Ocimum 
species spurred a scientific investigation into 
its chemical constituents. These studies have 
led to the identification and isolation of divers 
phytochemicals from different plant parts of 
Ocimum species. These include alkaloids, 
terpenoids, organic acids, tannins, flavonoids, 
coumarins, quinones, polyphenols, saponins, 
and their derivatives.
Ocimum americanum : Phytochemical analysis 
carried out by Dhale et al. [41]  showed that 
Ocimum americanum is rich in alkaloids, 
phenolic compounds, tannins, lignin, saponins, 
flavonoids, terpenoid, and anthraquinone. 
Alciléia et al. [42]  also gave a similar report, 
and as well documented compounds such 
as α-pinene, Camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, 
β-mircene, and other compounds which have 
been identified and isolated from its essential oil.
Ocimum basilicum: Sanni et al. [43]  and 
Ismail[44]  reported carbohydrates, tannins, 
cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, terpenes, and 
steroids in Ocimum basilicum leaves. Using 
a GC-MS, Andrew et al. [45]  carried out a 
chemical analysis that showed α-Pinene, β.-
Myrcene, 4-Hexen-1-ol acetate, and other 
important bioactive compounds in its essential 
leaf oil. Sarfaraz et al. [46]  also documented 
the presence of these compounds in a report on 
their analysis.
Ocimum gratissimum : A phytochemical report 
documented by Offiah and Chikwendu[47] 
revealed tannins, steroids, triterpenoids, and 
carbohydrates in Ocimum gratissimum. Prabhu 
et al. [48] also showed alkaloids, tannins, 
flavonoids, and oligosaccharides. Pandey and 
Chowdhury, [49] Matasyoh et al., [50]  Kéita 
et al.,[51]  and Jirovetz et al. [52]  have also 
documented specific compounds which have 
been isolated from Ocimum gratissimum, this 
has been summarized in table 2, and some of 
the structures shown in figure 1.
Ocimum Kilimandscharicum : According to a 
report by Tewari et al., [53], alkaloids, glycosides, 
saponins, flavonoids, phenols, carbohydrates, 
steroids, protein, and amino acids are among 
the phytochemicals present in Ocimum 
Kilimandscharicum. In their work, Charles and 
Simon[54] isolated seventeen compounds from 
its essential oil, including α- pinene, Camphene, 
ß-pinene, and Eugenol [table 2].
Ocimum sanctum : In a research work published 
by Xia et al., [55], carbohydrates, terpenoids and 
alkaloids were present in the ethanolic extract 
of Ocimum sanctum. Similarly, Devendran and 
Balasubramanian[56]  also reported the presence 
of flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, 
saponin and tannins, and carbohydrates 
terpenoids and alkaloids. Furthermore, using a 
GC-MS, analysis of the hydroalcoholic extract 
showed several compounds, including Eugenol 
and Caryophyllene.
Reported compounds isolated from the various 
Ocimum species have been outlined in table 2, 
while some of the structures are shown in figure 
1.

isolated from Ocimum species
Pharmacology
Several pharmacological studies have confirmed/
establish the efficacy of Ocimum species for their 
various therapeutic applications.
Ocimum americanum
Ocimum americanum has been documented 
to elicit significant antifungal activity,[57 - 59] 
gastric cytoprotective and antiulcer effect against 
acute gastric ulcer causative organism,[57 - 
60] wound healing activity,[57] larvicidal and 
insecticidal activity.[61] The essential oils also 
have effects such as cytotoxic, antimicrobial, 
and mosquito repellent effects.[59, 62] The 
antioxidant activity of Ocimum americanum has 
also been documented.[63 - 64] Sutilifj et al. 
reported that Ocimum americanum the whole 
plant, has a significant hemolytic effect. [65] 
Sethi et al. documented the antifungal activity 
of the plant [66], while Priscila et al. reported 
the bactericidal activity. [67] The antimicrobial 
activity against gram-positive and gram-negative 
bacteria has been reported by Thaweboon et al. 
[68] Aluko et al. also reported its antioxidant 
effect,[69] Sripriya et al. reported the significant 
analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of 
the leave-in laboratory mice.[70] According to 
Sinitha et al., Ocimum americanum elicits an 
immune-modulatory effect [71], while Lenise et 
al. have also documented its anesthetic activity. 
[72] Aluko et al. carried out a study to evaluate 
the hepatoprotective activity of Ocimum 
americanum leave in laboratory rats with 
paracetamol–induced liver damage and reported 
having a hepatoprotective effect.[73]
Ocimum basilicum
According to Politeo et al. and Ramesh et al., 
Ocimum basilicum is rich in antioxidants 
compounds and hence has high antioxidant 
activity.[74 - 75] Dwivedi et al. stated that the 
Solvent extracts of the plant elicit significant 
activity at the cellular level, including 
inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and 
anti-aggregatory effect on blood platelets.[76] 
Clinical studies reported by Siurin et al. and 
Nature et al. revealed that Ocimum basilicum 
volatile oil has characteristic antioxidant 
activities.[77 - 78] Bravo et al. also reported 
the protective activity of the ethanolic extract 
of Ocimum basilicum against mutagenesis 
and oxidative DNA damage, accompanied by a 
decrease in cholesterol synthesis accumulation 
of lipid in human macro-phages.[79] A report 
by Wannissorn et al. and Ahmet et al. reveals 
that Ocimum basilicum exhibits antibacterial 
effect against several bacteria, including C. 
perferingens, Salmonella spp., C. jejunii, and E. 
coli.[80 - 81] Also, Opalchenova and Obreshkova 
revealed that the plant aerial parts volatile oil 
elicit significant activity against drug immune 
clinical isolates of Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, 
and Staphylococcus.[82] Patel et al. have 
documented the significant antimicrobial effects 
of Ocimum basilicum from their study.[83] In 
vitro studies by Yamasaki, et al. revealed that 
Ocimum basilicum exhibits marked inhibitory 
actions against cytopathogenicity induced by 
HIV-1 in MT-4 cells.[84] Renzulli et al. reported 
that rosmarinic acid (a compound present in 
Ocimum basilicum) has significant inhibitory 
activity against inflammatory processes. In 
vitro studies reveal that rosmarinic reduces the 
production of oxygen species and inhibits protein 
and DNA synthesis induced by mycotoxins, 
hence preventing cell death.[85] In vitro study on 
P388 and KB cell lines by Manosroi et al. revealed 
that the essential oil Ocimum basilicum elicited 
moderate anti-proliferative activity compared to 
the standard drug 5-fluorouracil.[86] Mohan et 
al. reported the hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic 
activity of aqueous extract of Ocimum basilicum 
in laboratory rats. They observed a marked 
reduction in serum lipid, lipid peroxidation 
products, blood glucose level, and improvement 
in glucose tolerance.[87]
Ocimum gratissimum
The antibacterial and antifungal efficacy of 
Ocimum gratissimum has been reported in 
various studies.[88 - 89] Pharmacological 
study of the aqueous extract revealed it has an 
analgesic effect in mice, stomach strip blocking 
effect in rats, and inhibitory effect on rabbit 
jejunum pendular movement.[90] Iwalokun et al. 
revealed that the oil elicits a significant inhibitory 
activity against the virulent strains of Shigella, 
E. coli, and Salmonella.[91] The hexane fraction 
exhibits a highly significant antimicrobial activity 
against K. pneumonia and V. cholera.[92] It is 
significantly active against P. aeruginosa, S. 
Enegide  et al. Ocimum Species & Its importance 
Int. J. Curr. Res. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2021;5(2):1-12 5
Typhi,  V. cholera, and N. gonorrhea.[93] It has 
an excellent synergic activity with ampicillin, 
eliciting highly significant antibacterial effects 
against E. coli and P. mirabilis, and also possess 
similar synergic activity with nystatin and 
ketoconazole, eliciting significant antifungal 
effect against C. Albicans.[94] The anti-diarrheal 
activity of the leaf extract was established in a 
study by Ilori et al., which used the disc diffusion 
and tube dilution methods to ascertain its effect 
against bacteria S. Typhi, E. coli, S. dysenteriae, 
P. shigelloides, and A. sobria, and it proved to be 
a significant antibacterial agent.[95] Pratheeba 
et al. also revealed that the chloroform leaf 
extract had an excellent insecticidal effect 
against filariasis causing mosquito vector 
Culex quinquefasciatus.[96]  The plant leaves 
have been shown to possess a broad-spectrum 
antibacterial activity against P. mirabilis, E. 
coli, and S. aureus.[97] The methanolic leaf 
extract has been reported to be active against 
nicotine toxicity due to its ability to decrease free 
radical generation and lipid-protein damage, 
and antioxidant activity.[98]  The aqueous leaf 
extract has been reported to show significant 
hypoglycaemic effect, reducing lipid MDA, LDL- 
cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels [99] and 
caused a marked decrease in the plasma glucose 
level in laboratory rats in the streptozotocin-
induced diabetic model.[100] The aqueous leaf 
extract has been observed to inhibit proliferation, 
chemotaxis, induction of COX-2 protein and 
morphogenesis, and decrease the size of breast 
cancer tumors.[101] The dichloromethane leaf 
extract in an in vitro study inhibited myeloid 
leukemia [102]; hence, it may help treat human 
cancer. The methanolic crude leaf extract has 
been documented to be having haematinic and 
hemopoietic activity in laboratory rats.[103] An 
increase in erythrocytes, hemoglobin packed cell 
volume, thrombocytes, and neutrophils count, 
as well as increase in platelet distribution width, 
mean platelet volume, and platelet–large cell 
ratio (P–LCR) have been observed to be elicited 
by the leaf extract.[104] Reduction in the serum 
total protein and urea level, packed cell volume, 
neutrophils, hemoglobin, and increased uric 
acid, in total acid, prostatic acid, phosphatases, 
leucocytes, and lymphocytes have also been 
reported to be elicited by the plant.[105] Its leaf 
essential oil has been reported to show both 
fungistatic and fungicidal activity at different 
concentrations against A. alternata, S. rolfsii 
and C. capsici.[106] 
Ocimum kilimandscharicum
Hakkim et al. evaluated the antioxidant potential 
of the Methanolic leaf extract of Ocimum 
kilimandscharicum using an in vitro model. 
They reported it to exhibit a moderate activity 
compared to butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA).
[107]  Mwangi et al. also experimented to examine 
the antinociceptive activity of the alcoholic leaf 
extract of Ocimum kilimandscharicum in mice 
using the tail-flick model. The outcome revealed 
it to be a significant antinociceptive agent. [108] 
Based on their in-vitro antiplasmodial study 
using dichloromethane extract of leaves and 
twigs of Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Owuor 
et al. reported significant activity against both 
chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive 
Plasmodium parasites, [109]. In contrast, 
Runyoro et al. reported that the oil elicited 
larvicidal activity on Culex quinquefasciatus 
larvae. [110] Using castor-oil-induced diarrhoea 
model and castor oil-induced enteropooling 
assay in rats; and charcoal meal test/intestinal 
motility test in mice, Serin et al. demonstrated 
that the aqueous leaf extract has significant 
anti-diarrheal activity. [111]  Kumar et al. 
reported the significant antimicrobial activity 
of volatile oil of the whole plant of Ocimum 
kilimandscharicum against Gram-negative 
bacteria (E. coli, E. cloacae, Vibrio cholera, 
S. dysenteriae, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp), 
[112]  while Shinde et al. also reported its 
effectiveness against Gram-positive bacteria (S. 
aureus, S. epidermidis, S. mutans, S. viridians, 
B. subtilis, M. luteus). [113] Monga et al. also 
reported the antimelanoma and radioprotective 
effect of alcoholic aqueous extract in mice.[114] 
Jambere et al. carried out a laboratory test on the 
leaves of Ocimum kilimandscharicum against 
the following insects Rhyzopertha Dominica, 
Sitophilus zeamais, Sitotroga cerealella in maize 
and sorghum grains to evaluate its insecticidal 
activity. The reported experimental outcome 
showed it to be an effective insecticidal agent.
[115]  Mahesh et al. have also documented the 
significant wound healing activity of the aqueous 
extract as a result of the experiment they carried 
out on laboratory rats, using the excision, 
incision, and dead space wound model.[116]  
Ocimum sanctum
Ocimum sanctum has been chronicled and 
described to be having several pharmacological 
activities.  Rahman et al. reveals that Ocimum 
sanctum shows antimicrobial activity against a 
wide range of bacteria, including Staphylococci 
sp., E. coli, Shigella sp., S. aureus, Enterobacteria 
sp., P. aernginosa, S. Typhi, Staphylococci sp., 
C. Albicans, K. pneumonia, M. tuberculosis, 
and M. pyogenes. [117] According to an in vitro 
study by Farivar et al., Ocimum sanctum extract 
proved to be an effective anti-tuberculosis agent. 
[118] Khan et al. reported that aqueous, hexane, 
chloroform, n-butanol extracts, and essential 
oil of Ocimum sanctum showed significant 
antifungal activity against several fungi A. 
solani, C. guillermondii, C. capsici, Curvularia 
sp., F. solani, H. oryzae and A. flavus.[119 - 120] 
Kelm et al. also reported that the methanolic, 
hydroalcoholic, and aqueous extracts of Ocimum 
sanctum elicit significant antioxidant activity, 
both in vitro and in vivo. [121]  According to 
Geetha et al., Oral intake of the Ocimum sanctum 
significantly protects the liver and aortic tissue 
from hypercholesterolemia-induced peroxidative 
damage.[122]  Siva et al. documented that 
the Oral administration of Ocimum sanctum 
extract significantly reduced blood sugar levels 
Enegide  et al. Ocimum Species & Its importance 
Int. J. Curr. Res. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2021;5(2):1-12 6
in streptozotocin-induced and glucose-fed 
hyperglycemic diabetic rats. A different study 
by Gholap and Kar also showed that Ocimum 
sanctum reduced the serum concentration of 
cortisol and glucose and elicited antiperoxidative 
activity.[123]  Aruna et al., in their study, revealed 
that Ocimum sanctum leaves significantly 
reduced the squamous cell hematoma 
incidences and carcinoma in experimental rats.
[124]    The result from a study by Ganasoundari 
et al. revealed that Ocimum sanctum aqueous 
leaf extract inhibited hydroxyl (OH) radical-
induced deoxyribose degeneration significantly. 
They also showed the synergic activity WR-
2721 and Ocimum sanctum, which produced 
a better effect against OH radical activity when 
compared with the individual agents alone.
[125]  Shetty et al. experimented with evaluating 
the activity of Ocimum sanctum aqueous leaf 
extract on tumor necrosis factor-Alfa (TNF-Alfa) 
in laboratory rats, using the excision model. 
The result showed that the Ocimum sanctum 
extract increased the rate of epithelization and 
wound contraction, hence a significant wound 
healing effect. [126]  In the antiulcer study 
carried out by Govind et al. in rats using aspirin, 
indomethacin, alcohol (ethanol 50%), histamine, 
reserpine, serotonin, or stress-induced ulcers 
models, the oil of Ocimum sanctum showed 
significant antiulcer activity. [127]  Mediratta 
et al. reported that steam distilled leave extract 
of Ocimum sanctum caused a modification in 
laboratory rat humoral immune response. This 
could be attributed to antibody production, 
the release of mediators of hypersensitivity 
reactions, and tissue responses to mediators 
in the target organs.[128]   Godhwani et al., in 
a separate experiment, also demonstrated the 
immunomodulatory effect of  Ocimum sanctum 
using widal and sheep erythrocyte agglutination 
tests. [129]   Sridevi et al. showed that Ocimum 
sanctum has significant benefits when employed 
in the treatment of asthma and other related 
conditions. They also reported that Ocimum 
sanctum has the potential to cause mast cell 
stabilization, suppression of IgE, and inhibition 
of release of inflammatory mediators; hence, it 
may be the cause of these effects. [130] According 
to Ravindran et al., the Ocimum sanctum 
normalizes noise stress-induced alteration 
in neurotransmitter levels due to, and this is 
proof of its anti-stress activity. [131] Asha et 
al. showed the significant antihelmintic activity 
of Ocimum sanctum essential oil using the 
Caenorhabditis elegant model.[132]  Different 
extracts of stem and leaves of Ocimum sanctum 
were subjected to experimental studies for 
anticonvulsant activity by maximal electroshock 
model using phenytoin as standard. It was 
observed that ethanol and chloroform extract 
of leaf and stem produced significant preventive 
effects against toxic convulsions induced by 
trans corneal electroshock. [133]  Ocimum 
sanctum has also been shown to have a robust 
cardioprotective effect against myocardial 
agents.  Sood et al. revealed that Ocimum 
sanctum elicited significant protection against 
isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrosis 
in laboratory rats by increasing the activity of 
endogenous antioxidants. [134]  Joshi et al. 
reported that Ocimum sanctum L. alcoholic 
extract ameliorated scopolamine-induced 
amnesic effect as well as memory deficits caused 
by aging in laboratory mice. Ocimum sanctum 
both increased significantly step-down latency 
(SDL) and acetylcholine esterase inhibition. This 
may be useful in the treatment of dementia, 
Alzheimer’s disease, and other cognitive 
disorders.[135]  Ocimum sanctum has been 
documented to have a significant antidote effect 
against dog bite, snake bite, scorpion bite, and 
insect bites.[136]  
conclusIon
Ocimum species have been employed 
traditionally for therapy globally. The species 
reviewed are the most widely used from the 
Ocimum genus in traditional medicine, and they 
are also the most researched for intended use in 
conventional therapeutic practice. These species 
contain several compounds responsible for the 
numerous pharmacological activities elicited 
by them, including antimalarial, anticancer, 
antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant 
effects.
