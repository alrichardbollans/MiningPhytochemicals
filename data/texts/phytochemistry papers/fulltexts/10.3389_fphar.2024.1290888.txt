It is renowned for its effectiveness in treating lung andintestinal diseases (Wei et al., 2023). In traditional Chinesemedicine, it is commonly prescribed for relieving cough andasthma, as well as moisturizing the intestine to alleviateconstipation (Gao et al., 2014). Modern studies have shown thatASA has a diverse range of pharmacological effects, includingalleviating cough and resolving phlegm, as well asimmunomodulation and anti-inflammatory properties (Ma et al.,2021; Zhao Y. et al., 2022). Meanwhile, both clinical and animalexperiments have demonstrated that the effective components andprescriptions of ASA have significant therapeutic effects onrespiratory diseases (Si and Zhang, 2021; Wang et al., 2023).ASA is composed of various chemical components includingglycosides, organic acids, amino acids, flavonoids, terpenes,phytosterols, phenylpropanoids, and other substances. Theabundance of these active components makes ASA a valuablesubject for research and application. Amygdalin, as the mainactive ingredient in ASA, has been found to have beneficialeffects in relieving cough and asthma, as well as exhibiting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, which makes it apromising candidate for the treatment of respiratory diseases,with significant potential for disease management (Wang et al.,2021). Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects ofASA and its active ingredients on various respiratory conditions,including cough, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), pulmonary heart disease, and lung function injury.Moreover, recent research has also suggested its potential role intreating COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).Furthermore, ASA can be combined with other treatments toenhance its efficacy (Li et al., 2021; Noureen et al., 2022).Although considerable studies have been performed on the ASA(Wei et al., 2023), there is still a lack of comprehensive and in-depthreview of ASA. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive literaturesearch using online databases such as PubMed, Web of Science,China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and GoogleScholar, with the keywords including ASA, its bioactivecomponents, or ASA-containing formulas, up to December 2023.Then, we systematically summarize and highlight the botanicalfeatures and traditional uses, phytochemical components,pharmacological activities, clinical applications, toxicologicaleffects including adverse reactions and detoxification methods,and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ASA, attempting to lay afoundation for the in-depth basic research on ASA and expanding itsapplication in the clinical settings.2 Botanical features and traditional usesASA, as defined in the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia,refers to the dried ripe seeds of various species of Rosaceae, namely,P. armeniaca L.var.ansu Maxim., Prunus sibirica L., Prunusmandshurica (Maxim.) Koehne, or P. armeniaca L.It is recommended to harvest fully ripe fruits in the summer andextract their seeds by removing the pulp and core shell. The seedsshould then be dried under the Sun. ASA, which containscyanogenic components (Kovacikova et al., 2019), is known tohave beneficial properties and minor toxicity. In traditionalChinese medicine, it is believed that ASA affects the lung andlarge intestine meridian. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020 statesthat ASA has therapeutic effects such as lowering Qi, relieving coughand asthma, moisturizing the intestine, and relaxing the bowels (Weiet al., 2023) (Figure 1).ASA was first documented in Shennong’s Herbal (Shen NongBen Cao Jing). It has a sweet taste and warm nature, primarily usedfor alleviating coughs caused by Qi. However, according toMiscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians (Ming Yi Bie Lu),ASA is described as having a bitter and toxic taste, commonlyused to treat distress below the heart, abdominal fullness anddistention, and occasionally headaches (Xue et al., 2022). Theessentials of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Bei Yao) states that ASAis bitter in taste and warm in nature, with the ability to dissipate coldand alleviate irritable heat and shortness of breath. TheCompendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu) furtherindicates that ASA has various effects such as dispersing andreducing energy, relieving muscle and dispelling wind, reducingthe Qi and moistening dryness, eliminating food stagnation, andtreating injuries. Additionally, ASA has been found to have thepotential of treating sores and repelling insects due to its toxicity.The book Materia Medica Companion (Ben Cao Meng Quan)describes its properties in further detail. However, it is importantto note that ASA should not be used in conjunction with Astragaliradix—roots of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge (Fabaceae),Scutellariae radix—roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi(Lamiaceae), and Puerariae lobatae radix—roots of Puerarialobata Ohwi (Fabaceae). ASA is commonly used for coughs withphlegm, constipation, and insect bites. It is worth mentioning thatthe treatment for constipation varies depending on whether it isrelated to Qi or blood deficiency. ASA is used for addressing Qideficiency, while Persicae semen—seeds of Prunus persica (L.) Batsch(Rosaceae) is employed to promote blood circulation. In cases of Qideficiency and a floating pulse, a combination of ASA and Citrireticulatae pericarpium—epicarps of Citrus reticulata Blanco(Rutaceae) is recommended. On the other hand, combining P.semen with C. reticulatae pericarpium is advised for addressingblood deficiency and a sinking pulse (Du and Yu, 2023).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.12908883 Phytochemical componentsNumerous studies have shown that ASA contains a variety ofbioactive components and nutrients including glycosides, organicacids, amino acids, flavonoids, terpenes, phytosterols,phenylpropanoids, and other compounds. This section presents acompilation of literature on the chemical composition of ASA,providing detailed information on 170 major chemicalcomponents that have been isolated from it (Table 1).Furthermore, we have depicted the chemical structures of themain active components found in ASA (Figure 2).3.1 GlycosidesThe glycosides found in ASA primarily consist of cyanogenicglycosides, which serve as both its main toxic components and itsprimary pharmacologically active ingredients. The principalglycoside in ASA is amygdalin (1). It is important to note thatconsuming a large amount of amygdalin within a short period oftime may lead to cyanide poisoning. This occurs due to thehydrolysis of amygdalin by β-D-glucosidase, leading to theproduction of benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid, which cancause respiratory depression (Song and Xu, 2014).Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that amygdalinexhibits significant anti-tumor activity, as well as antinociceptiveand antiphlogistic effects, making it a promising candidate forvarious applications (Park et al., 2005; Hwang et al., 2008;Figurová et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). Inaddition, another cyanogenic glycoside called neoamygdalin (2)has been isolated and identified from ASA. Neoamygdalin is anepimorphous isoform of amygdalin and shows great potential in thetreatment of cough and asthma (Xu et al., 2017). Besides, massspectrometry analysis has revealed the presence of amygdalinmetabolites and its glycosides in ASA extracts, includingprunasin (3), mandelic acid-β-glucopyranoside (5), mandelicacid-β-gentiobioside (6), mandelic acid amide-β-glucopyranoside(7), mandelic acid amide-β-gentiobioside (8), and benzyl-β-gentiobioside (9). Furthermore, ASA methanol extracts alsocontain propyl-β-gentiobioside (4), adenosine (10) and cytarabine(11) (Chen Y. et al., 2022). The information of these glycosides islisted in Table 1, and the chemical structures were drawn byChemDraw 20.0 and presented in Figure 2.3.2 Organic acidsCurrently, a total of 39 organic acids have been isolated andidentified in ASA. Among them, (12–27) are fatty acids, accountingfor approximately 50% of ASA (Jin et al., 2018), which can bedivided into saturated fatty acids (12–17), monounsaturated fattyacids (18–23), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (24–27). Notably,unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (20), linoleic acid (24), andlinolenic acid (25) are essential for the human body as they cannotbe synthesized internally and must be obtained from food (Spectorand Kim, 2015). Pharmacological studies have demonstrated thatunsaturated fatty acids possess various beneficial effects such asregulation of thrombosis, immune modulation, and anti-fibrosis(Khosla and Fungwe, 2001; Vangaveti et al., 2016; Turolo et al.,2021), making them of significant medicinal value. In addition, ASAcontains a range of phenolic acids (28–36), which have antibacterial,anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation and other pharmacologicaleffects (Bak et al., 2013; Thakare et al., 2017). Furthermore,mandelic acid (42), a metabolite of amygdalin, has beeninvestigated for its antimicrobial activity and low vaginalirritation, particularly in the context of urinary tract infectionsand vaginal trichomoniasis (Xia et al., 2020). Other organic acids,including fumaric acid (47), malic acid (48), citric acid (49), andgluconic acid (50), have also been isolated and identified from ASA.Information of these organic acids is listed in Table 1. The chemicalstructures were drawn by ChemDraw 20.0 and shown in Figure 2.3.3 Amino acidsProtein is a crucial component of human cells and tissues. Thehuman body contains numerous proteins with diverse functions, allof which are formed through the dehydration and condensation ofFIGURE 1P. armeniaca and processed products of Armeniacae semen amarum.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888TABLE 1 Chemical components isolated and structurally identified from ASA.No. Chemical constituent MolecularformulaExtract Method ReferenceGlycosides1 Amygdalin C20H27NO11 Ethylacetate; ethanol HPLC-PDA-ESI/MS Hrichi et al.

However, the content of flavonoids inASA is 14.81 mg/100 g, less than 2‰ (Tanwar et al., 2018). Until now,43 flavonoids (69–112) have been isolated and characterized fromASA,among which catechin (69), epicatechin (70), rutin trihydrate (85),apigenin-7-glucoside (86), luteolin 7-xyloside (91), apigenin (92),tricetin 3′-xyloside (93) are flavanols.

Bavachinin (76), naringenin hexoside (77),procyanidin dimer (78) and isoliquiritigenin (98) aredihydroflavonoids. Phloridzin (79) and naringenin (87) aredihydrochalcones. Compounds (80–84, 88–90, 94–97, 112) areflavanols. Additionally, 12 anthocyanins (99–111) have beenextracted from ASA skins, which belong to flavonoids as well (Qinet al., 2019; Cecarini et al., 2022). These flavonoids are summarized inTable 1, and their chemical structures were drawn using ChemDraw20.0 and presented in Figure 2.FIGURE 2(Continued).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.12908883.5 TerpenoidsTerpenoids, which consist of isoprene as the fundamental structuralunit, are commonly found in Chinese herbal medicine and exhibitvarious pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, antimalarial,antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties (Atriyaet al., 2023). Currently, 20 terpenoids have been isolated andidentified from ASA. These include 13 monoterpenoids (113–125),3 sesquiterpenoids (126–128), two diterpenoids (trans-geranylgeraniol(129) and phytol (130)), and squalene (131), which belongs to theFIGURE 2(Continued).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888triterpenoid group. Moreover, amarogentin (132), a schizocycliciridoterpenoid, has also been isolated from the aqueous extract ofASA. These terpenoids are summarized in Table 1, and theirchemical structures were drawn by ChemDraw 20.0 and presentedin Figure 2.3.6 PhysterolsThe basic structure of sterols consists of cyclopentanepolyhydrophenanthrene and a hydroxyl group. Phytosterols, atype of sterols, are commonly found in various parts of plantsFIGURE 2(Continued).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888such as roots, stems, leaves, fruits, and seeds. Pharmacologicalstudies have demonstrated the beneficial physiological effects ofphytosterols, including their ability to prevent cardiovasculardiseases, inhibit tumor growth, promote metabolism, and regulatehormone levels (Bakrim et al., 2022; Nattagh-Eshtivani et al., 2022).The total phytosterol content in different varieties of ASA rangesfrom 215.7 to 973.6 mg/100 g of bitter apricot kernel oil (Rudzińskaet al., 2017). So far, researchers have isolated and identified10 phytosterols (133–142) from ASA. In addition, RudzińskaMagdalena et al. analyzed the composition of ASA fat oil usingTLC and capillary GLC methods, which revealed the presence ofmajor phytosterols such as cholesterol (134), campesterol (135),gramisterol (136), Δ5-avenasterol (137), Δ7-stigmasterol (138), Δ7-avenasterol (139), β-sitosterol (140), citrostadienol (141), and 24-methylene-cycloartanol (142). These physterols are summarized inTable 1. The corresponding chemical structures were drawn usingChemDraw 20.0 and presented in Figure 2.3.7 PhenylpropanoidsThe basic structural unit of phenylpropanoids consists of abenzene ring and three branched carbons (C6-C3). Until now,16 phenylpropanoids have been successfully isolated andidentified from ASA, among which (143–151, 155–158) arephenylpropanoic acids, coumarin (152) and psoralen (153) arecoumarins, and schisandrin (154) is lignan. Besides, chlorogenicacid (144), 5-feruloylquinic acid (148) and dicaffeoylquinic acidFIGURE 2(Continued).

These phenylpropanoids are summarized in Table 1,and their chemical structures were drawn by ChemDraw 20.0 andpresented in Figure 2 as well.3.8 OthersBesides the chemical constituents mentioned above, othercomponents have also been investigated and summarized inTable 1, and the corresponding chemical structures are drawn byChemDraw 20.0 in Figure 2. In brief, trehalose (159) and sucrose(160) are saccharides, berberine (161) and tetrahydropalmatine(162) are alkaloids, amygdalin amide (163), mandelamide (164),N-methoxy-N-methylbenzamide (165) and nicotinamide (166) areamide compounds. Furthermore, the compounds (167–170) are themain ingredients in ASA volatile oil.4 Pharmacological activitiesASA exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities andeffects due to its abundance of chemical components and activesubstances. These include anticancer activity (breast carcinoma,prostatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, renal cellcarcinoma, bladder cancer and other cancers), anti-oxidant activity,antimicrobial activity, anti-inflammation activity, cardiovascularprotection, neuroprotection, respiratory protection, digestivesystem protection, antidiabetic, liver and kidney protection, skinprotection and other pharmacological activities (Figure 3). Thefollowing is a detailed introduction to the pharmacologicaleffects of ASA.4.1 Anticancer activityIn recent years, the overall incidence and mortality of cancerare still on the rise. Despite advances in various comprehensivetherapies, the mortality rate of advanced malignant tumorsremains high (Chen L. et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022a; Minget al., 2022). ASA is rich in a variety of phytochemicalingredients, and amygdalin is one of its main activeingredients. Amygdalin is a phytochemical ingredient that hasbeen extensively studied for its therapeutic effects on varioustypes of cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer,hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer,bladder cancer, and others. Numerous studies havedemonstrated the therapeutic potential of different ASAextracts and amygdalin. The therapeutic mechanism of ASAprimarily involves inhibiting cancer cell adhesion, migration,and proliferation, as well as blocking the cell cycle, inducing celloxidative damage and apoptosis, and regulating autophagy.However, it is important to note that the current research onthe anticancer activity of ASA is mostly limited to in vitro cellstudies, with fewer in vivo studies and a lack of clinical trials.Therefore, further investigation is needed to fully explore ASA asa potential alternative therapy for cancer. The effects of ASA andamygdalin on different types of cancer and their actionmechanisms are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 4.4.1.1 Breast carcinomaBreast cancer is the most prevalent gynecological malignanttumor worldwide. The cure rate for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer can reach 80%. However, treating patients in theadvanced stages poses significant challenges (Zannetti, 2023).Conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted drugtreatment are commonly used to treat breast cancer.Unfortunately, many patients develop drug resistance, experiencecancer recurrence, and develop secondary diseases. In vitro studies,amygdalin, found in ASA, shows suppressive effects on variousbreast cancer cell lines including Hs578T, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,SK-BR-3, and T47D cells, by inhibiting cancerous proliferation andmigration, and inducing apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress.Amygdalin impedes cell adhesion and migration by regulatingintegrin protein expression, which are cell adhesion moleculesconsisting of α and β subunits. Integrins facilitate the interactionbetween cancer cells and components of the extracellular matrix,thus influencing cell adhesion and eventually leading to cancer cellmetastasis (Hoshino et al., 2015). In Hs578T breast cancer cells,amygdalin demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of celladhesion, and it was observed that this inhibitory effect couldpotentially be attributed to the downregulation of integrinα5 protein expression (Lee and Moon, 2016). A decrease inmRNA levels of integrin αV/β3 and integrin α5 was observed inboth MDA-MB-231 andMCF-7 cell lines, leading to the adhesion ofcancer cells to fibronectin and collagen in the extracellular matrix.This decrease has an impact on the migration and metastasis ofcancer cells. Notably, amygdalin shows a stronger inhibitory effecton integrin αV/β3 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, there weredistinct variations in mRNA levels of integrin β1, β2, and β4 betweenthe two cell lines. In MCF7 cells, integrin β1 and β4 levels increased,while integrin β2 levels decreased. Conversely, in MDA-MB-231 cells, the opposite trend was observed (Mosayyebi et al.,2021). The impact of amygdalin on cell adhesion and its effecton integrin protein expression have been extensively studied.However, the specific impact on different heterodimers is still notfully understood. A study conducted on MCF-7 cells showed thatafter 24 h and 48 h of amygdalin treatment, the IC50 values weredetermined to be 200.6 and 197 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally,Microarray Hybridization revealed that amygdalin candownregulate 19 out of 32 DNA replication-related genes,including MCM3, MCM6, MCM4, PCNA, and FEN1. Thissuggests that amygdalin may inhibit the proliferation of breastcancer cells by affecting DNA replication (Albogami andAlnefaie, 2021).Apoptosis has long been recognized as a significant mechanismfor preventing tumor development. The inhibitory effect ofapoptosis is determined by the expression of Bcl-2 and Baxproteins (Czabotar et al., 2014). Studies have shown thatamygdalin, at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/mL, effectivelysuppresses the expression of Bcl-2 protein and enhances theexpression of Bax in SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines(Moradipoodeh et al., 2020). This indicates that amygdalin caninhibit apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The human epidermalreceptor 2 (HER2) is closely associated with breast cancerFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888development and apoptosis (Shi et al., 2022). Molecular dockingstudies have revealed that amygdalin forms hydrogen bonds andhydrophobic interactions with Bcl-2 and the active site amino acidsof HER2 in HER2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells. However, thebinding ability of amygdalin to the active site amino acids ofHER2 is weaker compared to lapatinib, a HER2 tyrosine kinaseinhibitor. The metabolites of amygdalin, such as benzaldehyde,mandelonitrile, and cyanide, also bind to Bcl-2, although theirbinding affinity is weaker compared to amygdalin(Moradipoodeh et al., 2019). Another study found thatamygdalin can diminish the apoptosis of Hs578T breast cancercells by activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and regulatingFIGURE 3Pharmacological activities of Armeniacae semen amarum.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org16Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888TABLE 2 Anticancer activity of ASA.Types ofcancerCell line/modelCompound Minimal activeconcentration/doseMechanisms ReferenceBreast carcinoma Hs578T cells Amygdalin 10, 20, 40 mg/mL Induction of apoptosis by intensifyingthe protein expressions of Bax andpp38 MAPK, while decreasing Bcl-2and pro-caspase-3 protein expression;Decreasing adhesion via down-regulating integrin α5 proteinexpressionLee and Moon(2016)Breast carcinoma MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cellsAmygdalin IC50 (MCF-7) = 34, 30 and 25 mg/mL for24, 48 h and 72 h, respectively; IC50(MDA-MB-231) = 28, 23.5 and 21 mg/mLfor 24, 48 h and 72 h, respectivelySuppressing adhesion and migration,decreasing adhesion to fibronectin andcollagen I, regulating mRNA levels ofintegrin α and βMosayyebi et al.(2021)Breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells Amygdalin IC50 = 200.6 and 197.9 μg/mL for 24 and48 h, respectivelyInhibiting proliferation and blockingDNA replicationAlbogami andAlnefaie (2021)Breast carcinoma MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cellsAmygdalin 5, 10, 20 mg/mL Inducing apoptosis, elevating Baxprotein expression and descending Bcl-2 protein expressionMoradipoodehet al.

Furthermore, when MCF-7 breast cancer cells andMCF-10A normal cells were treated with 50 μM amygdalin and1 mg/mL ASA extract, it was observed that the activities ofproteasomes 20S and 26S, Cathepsin B, and cathepsin L in MCF-7 cells were inhibited. Additionally, the expressions of p53, p27, andBax were increased, indicating that amygdalin and ASA extract maypromote apoptosis and regulate the autophagy cascade (Cecariniet al., 2022). Moreover, amygdalin can induce oxidative stress inbreast cancer cells by increasing GSH activity and reducing MDAand oxidized glutathione levels, thereby exerting anti-cancer effects(Abboud et al., 2019).TABLE 2 (Continued) Anticancer activity of ASA.Types ofcancerCell line/modelCompound Minimal activeconcentration/doseMechanisms Referenceregulate autophagy; Down-regulatingthe expressions of TNF-α, VEGF andPCNA to exert anti-inflammation,anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferation effects, respectivelyNon-small celllung cancerH1299/M and PA/M cellsAmygdalin 2.5 and 5 mg/mL Impeding proliferation, invasion andmigration by hampering integrin β1,integrin β4, ILK, FAK, p-FAK, β-catenin, Akt and RICTOR proteinexpressions while up-regulating theexpression of E-cadherinQian et al.

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate thepotential of natural chemical components found in plants asalternative therapies for prostate cancer treatment (Martínez-Piñeiro et al., 2003). Amygdalin has demonstrated anti-prostatecancer activity in LNCaP, DU-145, and PC3 cells. Its primarymechanisms involve inhibiting cell adhesion, migration andmetastasis, and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest,attributed to its downregulation of integrin α6 and Bcl-2,while upregulation of integrin α2, Bax and caspase-3, as wellas inhibition of CDK1-cyclin B axis and the AKT-mTOR pathway.A study demonstrated that treating DU-145 prostate cancercells with 10 mg/mL amygdalin for 24 h inhibited their adhesion,chemotaxis, and migration. This inhibition was attributed to thedownregulation of integrin α2 and the upregulation of α6.Integrin α2 plays a critical role in cell adhesion, which in turnregulates cell invasion and metastasis. However, a decrease inadhesion of PC3 cells was observed only after 2 weeks ofamygdalin treatment, with no impact on their chemotaxis andmigration abilities. Further experiments involving the knockoutof integrins α2, α6, and β1 revealed distinct changes in theadhesion, chemotaxis, and migration abilities of DU-145 andPC3 cells (Mani et al., 2020). In conclusion, the effects ofamygdalin on cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis areinfluenced by the epigenetics of tumor cells, and each cell linemay have a specific set of receptors. Amygdalin has shownpotential anticancer activities by influencing the cell cycle. Ina 2-week study, amygdalin administration resulted in theprolongation of the G0/G1 phase and the shortening of the Sphase and G2/M phase in LNCaP, DU-145, and PC3 cells.Additionally, it inhibited the expression of cell cycleregulatory proteins, including CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A,cyclin B and cyclin D3, as well as the AKT-mTOR signalingcascade (Makarević et al., 2016). Furthermore, amygdalin hasbeen found to enhance cell apoptosis by increasing caspase-3enzyme activity and Bax protein expression, while decreasingBcl-2 protein expression (Chang et al., 2006).FIGURE 4Anticancer activities of Armeniacae semen amarum.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org19Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.12908884.1.3 Hepatocellular carcinomaHepatocellular carcinoma is a prevalent type of cancer. A studyinvolving 148 hepatocellular carcinoma patients found that 75 ofthem died within 22 months. Cirrhosis developed in 77% of thepatients, and the 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 70.8% and47.6% respectively (Wongjarupong et al., 2021). After administeringASA treatment, there was a significant increase in the proportion ofearly apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis cells inHepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma. This effect was positivelycorrelated with the upregulation of p53, Caspase-3, and Bcl-2activities, as well as the downregulation of Bax. It is worth notingthat the pro-apoptotic effect of amygdalin is enhanced with theaddition of zinc (El-Desouky et al., 2020). Sorafenib, a commonlyused targeted drug for liver cancer treatment, often leads to severeside effects and drug resistance in patients (Zheng et al., 2014).Experiments have demonstrated that 2.6 mg/mL amygdalin alone orin combination with sorafenib can induce cell cycle arrest inHepG2 cells and trigger autophagy and apoptosis. These resultsalign with the upregulation of AMPK, HMGB1, beclin-1, andATG5 mRNA levels, as well as the downregulation of mTOR andBcl-2 levels. Unlike sorafenib, amygdalin can increase GSH level,reduce MDA level, and exhibit strong DPPH free radical scavengingability (El-Sewedy et al., 2023). These findings suggest thatamygdalin holds significant potential for the treatment ofhepatocellular carcinoma.The therapeutic effects of ASA extract on liver cancer have beendemonstrated in vivo. When liver cancer is induced by 2,2′-Bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric (DMBA), ASA methanol-water extract andamygdalin have been shown to significantly increase the levels ofSOD, CAT, GSH, and TAC, while inhibiting MDA levels. Theseeffects contribute to the anti-oxidant properties of ASA, which arecrucial in protecting the liver from oxidative damage. Additionally,ASA has been found to downregulate the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 andbeclin-1, reduce TNF-α and VEGF contents, and downregulatePCNA protein expression in mouse liver tissues (Hosny et al.,2021). These findings indicate that ASA can inhibit inflammationthrough apoptosis, autophagy, angiogenesis, and proliferationpathways, thereby exerting anti-cancer effects.4.1.4 Lung cancerLung cancer is a prevalent and deadly malignant tumor thatoften metastasizes to various organs including the brain, bone, liver,and kidney. Current treatments primarily focus on primary lungcancer, leading to a poor prognosis for metastatic patients (Yin et al.,2021). However, in highly metastatic non-small cell lung cancer celllines H1299/M and PA/M, amygdalin at concentrations of 2.5 and5 mg/mL significantly inhibits cell proliferation, migration, andinvasion. The inhibition rates of cell proliferation decreased by15.6% and 25.1% respectively under these concentrations.Amygdalin achieves its function by reducing the levels of integrinβ1 and β4, while upregulating the level of E-cadherin (Qian et al.,2015). This not only affects tumor cell adhesion but also activatesFAK, β-catenin, and the downstream AKT-mTOR signalingpathway to mediate cell proliferation, adhesion, and metastasis.Additionally, amygdalin effectively promotes cancer cell apoptosisin A549 and PC9 cancer cells in vitro, as well as in A549 cellxenograft mice. This is achieved by inhibiting the NF-κB signalingpathway through increased protein expression of NF-κB-1 andfurther altering the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bax,Bcl-2, cytochrome C, caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP (Lin et al.,2022). In conclusion, amygdalin shows promising potential fortreating lung cancer and may serve as a potential NF-κB-1 agonist.4.1.5 Renal cell carcinomaRenal cell carcinoma, which accounts for 80% of all kidneycancers, is a common type of urinary tract tumor. In theUnited States, there are approximately 64,000 new cases and14,000 deaths associated with renal cell carcinoma each year(Singh, 2021). Amygdalin has demonstrated anti-renal cellcarcinoma activity in vitro, specifically in Caki-1, KTC-26, andA498 cells. This activity is attributed to the regulation of integrinα and β protein expressions, leading to the inhibition of adhesionand migration. Additionally, amygdalin inhibits CDK/cyclincomplexes, thereby arresting the cell cycle.Amygdalin at a concentration of 10 mg/mL has been found toinhibit the adhesion, chemotaxis and migration of Caki-1, KTC-26and A498 cells, due to the downregulation of integrins α5 andα6 levels. Furthermore, the expression changes of other integrinsubtypes in these cells vary, suggesting that the integrin profile maybe specific to each cell line (Juengel et al., 2016a). Additionally,amygdalin induces cell cycle arrest by increasing the number of cellsin the G0/G1 phase of Caki-1 and A498 cells, and in the S phase ofKTC-26 cells, which may be attributed to the diminishment of CDK,CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin D protein expressions(Juengel et al., 2016b). Notably, amygdalin may impact cancer celldifferentiation by regulating N-cadherin and E-cadherin, potentiallyinfluencing the prognosis of the cancer. However, further research isnecessary to investigate the specific impact of cadherin on celldifferentiation in renal cell carcinoma.4.1.6 Bladder cancerBladder cancer is a prevalent form of cancer that affects theurinary system, leading to significant morbidity andmortality. A keysymptom of bladder cancer is painless hematuria. As the diseaseprogresses, patients may experience urinary retention, poorurination, and urinary tract obstruction (Xiang et al., 2021). Inrecent studies, amygdalin has shown promise in inhibiting theadhesion of bladder cancer cells (UMUC-3, TCCSUP, andRT112) by potentially affecting integrin expression. However, thespecific integrin profile in different cell lines appears to play a moresignificant role. Furthermore, amygdalin has been observed toimpede the migration of UMUC-3 and RT112 cells, whileparadoxically increasing the migration of TCCSUP cells(Makarević et al., 2014b). It is important to note that althoughamygdalin can inhibit cancer cell adhesion, prolonged exposure tocertain cancer cells may promote the migration of non-adherentcells. Additionally, amygdalin has demonstrated inhibitory effectson the growth and proliferation of UMUC-3, TCCSUP, andRT112 cancer cells. This is primarily achieved by causing cellcycle delay and arresting cells in the G0/G1 phase, possiblythrough the downregulation of CDK2 and cyclin A proteinexpression (Makarević et al., 2014a).4.1.7 Other cancersIn addition to its therapeutic potential for the above cancertypes, ASA has also shown suppression of cervical cancer, pancreaticFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org20Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888cancer and blood cancer, mainly based on the effects of amygdalin.Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that amygdalinhas positive therapeutic effects on cervical cancer. The mainmechanism of amygdalin’s therapeutic effect is inhibition of cellgrowth and promotion of apoptosis (Chen et al., 2013).Furthermore, research has shown that the methanol aqueousextract of ASA and amygdalin can promote apoptosis in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (Aamazadeh et al., 2020). Additionally, aseparate study found that the ethyl acetate extract of ASA has aninhibitory effect on NALM-6 acute B lymphoid leukemia cells andKG-1 myeloid leukemia cells (Mosadegh Manshadi et al., 2019).4.2 Anti-oxidationThe anti-oxidant activity of ASA primarily involves theelimination of lipid peroxidation, reduction of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) accumulation, and enhancement of anti-oxidantenzyme activity, and the main functional substances arepolyphenols (Table 3). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a crucialmarker for LPO resulting from the oxidation of polyunsaturatedfatty acids (Liu et al., 2018). A study with the ethanol-induced ratliver injury and oxidative stress model has demonstrated thatconsumption of ASA significantly decreases LDH content inserum, MDA level in red blood cells, brain, kidney and heart ofrats while increasing the content of anti-oxidant enzymes such assuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) inthe liver (Yurt and Celik, 2011). This indicates that ASA can preventliver injury by increasing the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes andinhibiting lipid peroxides to resist oxidative stress. Mahboub, H.H.et al. have also reported that ASA consumption significantlyenhances the overall anti-oxidant capacity within cyprinus carpio,which may be attributed to the upregulation of anti-oxidantenzymes. When 10 g/kg ASA was added to the basic diet forcontinuous feeding over a period of 60 days, the total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), and SOD contents inliver tissue were increased from 16.66 ng/mg to 58.33 ng/mg,30.33 mmol/g to 66.33 mmol/g, and 14 to 48 U/mg respectively,meanwhile, SOD, GPX, and GSS mRNA levels in spleen were alsointensified (Mahboub et al., 2022).In addition, the anti-oxidant capacity of ASA is positivelycorrelated with the total phenolic content in the extract. Phenoliccompounds have the ability to scavenge free radicals and participatein redox reactions to protect cells from oxidative damage(Desmarchelier et al., 2005). Qin, F. et al. extracted ASA with50% ethanol and found that the extract had a total phenoliccontent of 874.49 ± 6.75 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalent)/100 gfresh weight. This extract demonstrated excellent free radicalscavenging ability in free radical scavenging assays. The extractshowed significantly stronger total reducing activity, 2′-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) free radical scavengingactivity, and H2O2 scavenging activity compared to ascorbic acid.However, its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicalscavenging ability, hydroxide ion, and peroxy ion werecomparable to that of ascorbic acid (Qin et al., 2019). However,Yiğit, D. et al. extracted ASA with methanol and water, the totalphenolic content was 0.4 and 0.5 μg GAE/mL, respectively, while theDPPH free radical scavenging activity was poor at the concentrationof 100–300 μg/mL, indicating that the total phenolic content of ASAis a key factor affecting its anti-oxidant capacity (Yiğit et al., 2009).Furthermore, the variety and origin of ASA also play important rolesin determining the total phenolic content. Among the five varietiesof ASA in Poland, the “Somo” variety had the highest total phenoliccontent of 1.22 mM GAE/L, and this variety showed the best anti-oxidant activity according to the ferric reducing anti-oxidant power(FRAP) test. Similarly, ASA from five different regions of Pakistanexhibited significant differences in anti-oxidant activity afterextraction with n-hexane. The ASA from Badoghur had a totalphenol content of 5,005 mg GAE/100 g dry weight, which wassignificantly higher than that of other origins. Additionally, ASAfrom Badoghur showed the smallest half maximal inhibitoryconcentration (IC50) value in total anti-oxidant capability,hydrogen peroxide scavenging, DPPH, and FRAP experiments,indicating the strongest anti-oxidant activity (Tareen et al., 2021).Moreover, recent studies have revealed that ASA contains othercomponents, besides phenols, that have anti-oxidant capacity. Onesuch component is a neutral polysaccharide called AP-1, which wasextracted and isolated from ASA. AP-1 exhibited a maximuminhibition rate of 87.74% for DPPH radical scavenging activity ata concentration of 10 mg/mL, which is slightly lower than that ofvitamin C. However, ABTS assay revealed that AP-1 has comparablefree radical scavenging ability and hydroxyl radicals to vitamin C(Peng et al., 2023). Furthermore, amygdalin also demonstrated anti-oxidant capacity by inhibiting ROS accumulation and activatinganti-oxidant enzyme activities such as catalase (CAT) and SOD inRAW264.7 cells (Trang et al., 2022).4.3 Antimicrobial activityA growing number of experimental studies have demonstratedthe broad spectrum of antibacterial activity exhibited by ASA.Different extracts of ASA have varying degrees of antibacterialactivity, as outlined in Table 4. Among these extracts, ASAvolatile oil stands out for its extensive antibacterial activity,which is likely attributed to its main component, benzaldehyde.This component has been widely utilized in cosmetics due to itsantibacterial, antiseptic, and stabilizing effects (Rodrigues and deCarvalho, 2022). ASA volatile oil exhibits excellent antibacterialactivity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcusaureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant S.aureus as well as Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichiacoli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. aeruginosa D24, Salmonellatyphimurium and Shigella sonnei. Complete growth inhibitionwas observed with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)ranging from 250 to 500 μg/mL. Furthermore, the ASA essentialoil also displayed certain antibacterial activity against several otherclinical pathogenic bacteria (Lee et al., 2014). Additionally, ASAvolatile oil exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on Listeriamonocytogenes in solid medium, micro-atmospheric medium,liquid medium and beef slices (Wang et al., 2020). Listeriamonocytogenes is an intracellular parasite, primarily transmittedthrough food, and severe poisoning can result in blood and braininfections (Stevens et al., 2006). Studies have indicated thatpolyphenols can bind to bacterial cell membrane, disruptbacterial cell membrane proteins, induce bacterial metabolicFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org21Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888disorders, and ultimately inhibit bacterial growth or kill bacteria(Messaoudene et al., 2022). ASA is rich in polyphenols, whichexhibit significant antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and Acetobacter aceti) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus).The inhibitory zone ranges from 13.0 to 18.6 mm and MIC between31.25 and 250 μg/mL (Qin et al., 2019). However, ASA demonstratesa stronger antibacterial effect against Gram-positive bacteria. Thiscould be attributed to the outer membrane permeability barrier ofGram-negative bacteria cell wall, which limits the interactionbetween antibacterial agents and their targets within bacterialcells. Moreover, both aqueous and alcoholic extracts of ASAdisplay significant antibacterial activity against E. coli and S.aureus with inhibitory diameters ranging from 13 to 15 mm andMIC values of 0.312–0.625 mg/mL (Yiğit et al., 2009). However, theASA base oil exhibits poor antibacterial activity, consistent withprevious findings that the fatty acids in ASA lack antibacterialproperties (Moola et al., 2022).Millions of people worldwide are affected by superficialfungal infections, the most common skin disease caused bydermatophytes that parasitize on the surface layer of thestratum corneum. Microsporum canis and Microsporum areoften implicated in these infections. The clinical symptoms ofdermatophytosis are generally mild, and active lesions typicallyheal within 6–8 weeks. ASA volatile oil has demonstratedsignificant antibacterial activity against keratinophilic fungi,completely inhibiting their growth at a concentration of100 μg/mL (Ibrahim and Abd El-Salam, 2015). In addition,among various ASA extracts, volatile oil exhibited notableinhibitory effects on Malassezia furfur and Candida albicans,with MIC of 250 and 1,000 μg/mL (Lee et al., 2014), respectively.However, ASA polyphenols only showed moderate inhibitionagainst candida, while base oil displayed poor inhibitory activity(Yiğit et al., 2009; Moola et al., 2022). Furthermore, ASA volatileoil exhibited inhibitory effect on 19 plant pathogenic fungi,suggesting its potential as a plant and agricultural fungicide(Geng et al., 2016).ASA is known to contain antibacterial substances such asvolatile oil and polyphenols, which contribute to its excellentantibacterial potential. While there have been numerous studieson the antibacterial activity of ASA, few have explored its underlyingmechanism. Mahboub, H.H. et al. suggested that the antibacterialeffect of ASA might be attributed to immune enhancement(Mahboub et al., 2022), while Mikoshiba, S. et al. proposed thatmetabolism could play a vital role (Mikoshiba et al., 2006). However,these studies are still limited, and further research is necessary tofully understand the antibacterial mechanism of ASA.4.4 Anti-inflammationThe main substance exerting anti-inflammation effect in ASAmay be amygdalin, which can inhibit the abnormal activation ofTGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and TLR4/NF-κB signalingpathway (Figure 5, Table 5). It was found that intraperitonealinjection of 4 mg/kg amygdalin significantly alleviate bleomycin-induced neutrophil inflammatory infiltration in mouse lung tissuesand reduced the number of macrophages and neutrophils in BALF,which are precursors of immune defense. The underlyingmechanism may be the inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad signalingpathway (Jiao et al., 2023). In addition, amygdalin can directlyhamper the expression of cytokines to exert anti-inflammatoryeffect. In the model of intraplantar injection of formalin, 1 mg/kgamygdalin significantly inhibited TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA levels inrat paw skins, which was comparable to that of indomethacin(Hwang et al., 2008). Besides, amygdalin can regulate theexpression of inflammation-related enzymes and play an indirectanti-inflammatory role.

However, further studies areneeded to determine whether other components of ASA haveanti-oxidant effects.4.5 Cardiovascular protectionThe latest evidence indicates that cardiovascular disease isresponsible for 31% of global deaths. It has been established thatadopting a healthy diet is crucial in reducing the risk ofcardiovascular diseases (Dikariyanto et al., 2021). Cardiovasculardiseases encompass various heart and vascular conditions such ascoronary heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, peripheralvascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, vascular disease, andrheumatic heart disease. ASA, which is rich in unsaturated fattyacids, has been proven to effectively lower biochemical and arterialmarkers associated with cardiovascular risk (de Oliveira et al., 2017).Moreover, ASA is abundant in anthocyanins, flavonoids, andphenolic acids, with concentrations of up to 118.17 mg/100 g,113.66 mg/L, and 91.42 mg/100 mL, respectively (Qin et al.,2019). These substances have also demonstrated positive effectson cardiovascular diseases (Perez-Vizcaino and Duarte, 2010;Blesso, 2019; Potì et al., 2019; Mattioli et al., 2020). Therefore,ASA exhibits significant potential and advantages in the treatment ofcardiovascular system diseases, mainly due to the functions ofunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, flavonoids, and amygdalin.Currently, ASA and its active ingredients have been shown tocontribute to cardiovascular health in both in vivo experiments andclinical studies (Table 5). In a rat myocardial ischemia-reperfusioninjury model, it was observed that continuous treatment with 2, 6,and 10 mL/kg of ASA oil for 2 weeks resulted in a significantreduction in the myocardial infarction area of rats. Additionally,the activities of serum creatine kinase and aspartateaminotransferase increased, leading to an increased production ofATP. This increase in ATP production provides sufficient energy forthe physiological needs of the heart. Moreover, supplementationwith ASA oil also demonstrated a significant increase in the activityof antioxidant enzymes such as myocardial CAT, SOD, andglutathione peroxidase. This increase in anti-oxidant enzymeactivity enhances the anti-oxidant defense system while reducingthe content of MDA and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Ultimately,these effects provide a protective effect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiomyocytes (Zhang et al., 2011). In recentyears, there has been increasing attention on amygdalin, the maincomponent of ASA. It has been demonstrated in vitro thatamygdalin can effectively inhibit Ang II-induced cardiomyocytehypertrophy, reduce inflammatory response, and exhibit anti-oxidant activity when treating H9C2 cells induced by Ang II atconcentrations of 80, 160, and 320 μM. These effects of amygdalinare primarily achieved through the reduction of atrial natriureticpeptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, and β-MHC, which are related tocardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, amygdalin inhibits theexpression of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, iNOS, COX-2, and phospho-NF-κB protein. Furthermore, amygdalin increasesthe expression of Nrf2, CAT, SOD-2, and GPX-4, which are proteinsrelated to oxidative stress (Kung et al., 2021). Both in vitro and invivo studies have also indicated that amygdalin can alleviateatherosclerosis. This effect may be attributed to its inhibition ofthe inflammatory response, enhancement of immune regulatoryfunction in regulatory T cells, or inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB andBcl-2/Bax signaling pathways (Jiagang et al., 2011; Wanget al., 2022).The benefits of ASA for cardiovascular disease have beenextensively studied due to its various components and provenefficacy. ASA has been shown to exert cardiovascular protectiveeffects by reducing cholesterol levels, particularly low-densitylipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (Kopčeková et al., 2021). Clinicalresearch reports have demonstrated that after 6 consecutive weeks oftaking 60 mg/kg ASA, volunteers experienced a significant decreasein serum LDL-C levels. It is important to note that elevated levels ofLDL-C can contribute to the development of cardiovascularatherosclerosis and the blockage of blood vessels by causingexcessive fat absorption in extrahepatic cell tissues (Siri-Tarinoet al., 2010). In another clinical study, it was observed that after12 weeks of taking 60 mg/kg ASA, total cholesterol levels decreasedby 8.64% and LDL-C levels decreased by 21.2%. Additionally, therewas a slight increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, along with an increase in C-reactive protein and serumcreatine kinase levels (Kopčeková et al., 2018). Importantly, studieshave shown that for every 1% reduction in LDL-C, the risk ofcoronary heart disease is reduced by up to 3% (Brown andGoldstein,2006). This indicates that consuming ASA can significantly reducethe risk of cardiovascular disease. Further investigation revealed thatTABLE 4 (Continued) Antimicrobial activity of ASA.PathogenicmicroorganismExtract/compoundIn vitro/In vivoMinimal activeconcentration/doseMechanisms ReferenceGloeosporium orbiculare Volatile oil In vivo 4–12 mg/mL High protective and therapeutic effects Geng et al. (2016)Blumeria graminis Volatile oil In vivo 4–12 mg/mL Medium protective effect and weaktherapeutic effectGeng et al. (2016)Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org25Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888after a 6-week administration of ASA to 21 individuals with normalcholesterol levels and 13 patients with high cholesterol levels, therewas no significant change observed in the total cholesterol contentand average LDL-C levels of the normal individuals. Similarly, theaverage total cholesterol content and average LDL-C levels of thepatients with HDL-C levels also did not exhibit a significant change.However, a reduction in density cholesterol levels was observed, andthe LDL3–7 subfractions were only detected in one individual(Kopčeková et al., 2022). It is important to note that the LDL3–7subfractions, which are part of very low-density lipoproteins, havesmaller particle sizes compared to LDL1 and LDL2, and areassociated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis (Qiao et al., 2022).In simpler terms, the intake of ASA can modify the lipoproteinprofile of individuals with hypercholesterolemia by primarilyreducing low-density lipoprotein levels, without negativelyaffecting lipid metabolism in healthy individuals.In summary, ASA exerts cardiovascular protection mainly byreducing LDL levels, inhibiting oxidative stress and regulatingFIGURE 5Anti-inflammation of Armeniacae semen amarum.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org26Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888immunity, which strongly supports the use of ASA in themanagement of cardiovascular diseases.4.6 NeuroprotectionAlzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease are two commonneurodegenerative diseases characterized by neuronal damage andbehavioral dysfunction. The pathological processes involved in thesediseases include immune inflammation, oxidative stress, andmitochondrial dysfunction (Chen W. et al., 2022).Phytochemicals with anti-oxidant properties are known to havethe potential to provide neuroprotection (Chakraborty et al., 2022).ASA, abundant in flavonoids, polyphenols, and other anti-oxidativecompounds, shows promising potential for treatingneurodegenerative diseases by suppressing inflammation,oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity (Table 5).Microglia, immune effector cells in the central nervous system,play a role in releasing inflammatory mediators that contribute toneurotoxicity and the development of neurodegenerative diseases(Simpson and Oliver, 2020). Studies have demonstrated that ASAextract can inhibit COX-2 and iNOS mRNA levels in BV2 cellsstimulated by LPS. This inhibition leads to a reduction in thesynthesis of PGE2 and the production of NO, therebysuppressing immune and inflammatory responses and exerting aneuroprotective effect (Chang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007). AchE,present in neurons, serves as an indicator of neuronal damage(Olasehinde and Olaniran, 2022). In vitro studies, ASA waterextract exhibits significant anticholinesterase activity with anIC50 of 134.93 μg/mL. Additionally, treatment with 100 μg/mLASA water extract demonstrates a favorable neuroprotectiveeffect against H2O2-induced damage to PC12 neuron cells,resulting in a cell survival rate of 70.71%. In comparison,PC12 cells treated with 400 μM hydrogen peroxide exhibit asurvival rate of less than 40% (Vahedi-Mazdabadi et al., 2020).It has been demonstrated in vivo studies that the methanolextract of ASA at concentrations of 100, 300, and 800 mg/kg has aprotective effect on haloperidol-induced Parkinson’s disease model.Behavioral analysis has shown that ASA treatment improves motoractivity, motor coordination, and exploratory activities in rats. It alsoreduces depression, anxiety, and convulsive seizures, accompaniedby a decrease in dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, andnorepinephrine neurotransmitter levels. Additionally, there is asignificant increase and decrease in AchE levels. Furthermore,behavioral improvement and brain function recovery arepositively correlated with increased anti-oxidant enzyme activityin the body (Saleem et al., 2022). Moreover, amygdalin also showspotential neuroprotective effects, possibly due to its induction ofcalreticulin protein expression, which plays a vital role in thesurvival, differentiation, and regulation of neurons (Chenget al., 2015).4.7 Respiratory protectionRespiratory system diseases are diverse and common, affectingthe trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Some prevalent conditions in thiscategory include asthma, COVID-19, acute lung injury, and chronicobstructive pneumonia (Tavares et al., 2020). ASA, an importantChinese herbal medicine, is used to treat cough and has variousfunctions such as enhancing lung function, relieving constipation,and promoting intestinal peristalsis. According to traditionalChinese medicine, bitter purgation helps disperse and move lungQi, thereby eliminating phlegm (Gao et al., 2011). Pharmacologicalstudies have shown that amygdalin, an effective component of ASA,is hydrolyzed to hydrocyanic acid and benzaldehyde in the bodyafter oral administration, thereby relieving cough, asthma and otherrespiratory system diseases (Figure 6).The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the 2019 novelcoronavirus, is spreading globally. It is characterized bysymptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue, which can leadto severe respiratory failure and even death. Additionally, patientsmay experience muscle aches and diarrhea, and in severe cases, theymay develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, orsuccumb to the disease (Du et al., 2021). Through networkpharmacology and molecular docking, it was found thatstigmasterol, sitosterol, sholesterol, (6Z,10E,14E,18E)-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosa-2,6,10,14,18,22-hexaene,oestrone, diisooctyl succinate, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, andamygdalin are suggested to be the nine key active ingredients forthe treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, IL6, SRC, MAPK1, MAPK3,VEGFA, EGFR, HRAS, and CASP3 are identified as potential coretargets for ASA treatment. It has been demonstrated that atherapeutic potential of amygdalin in vivo experiments.Moreover, The administration of 0.5–2 mg/kg of amygdalin hasbeen shown to regulate the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, VEGFsignaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway, resulting insignificant inhibition of EGFR, phospho-AKT, phospho-SRC,VEGFA, MAPK1, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α protein expressions(Wang et al., 2021). However, more research is required tosupport the use of ASA in the treatment of COVID-19.Allergic asthma, which is the most common type of asthma, ischaracterized by chronic airway inflammation involving Tlymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, and other cells (Possa et al.,2013). Several studies have demonstrated that ASA aqueous extractshows promising therapeutic effects in both an ovalbumin-inducedallergic airway inflammation model in vivo and lymph node primarycells in vitro. This therapeutic effect of ASA is attributed to areduction in IL-4 and IL-5 levels (Do et al., 2006). IL-4 isresponsible for the transformation of regulatory T cells intohelper T cells, while IL-5 regulates the growth, differentiation,and activation of eosinophils (Jin et al., 2019). However, furtherresearch is necessary to determine whether ASA exhibits similartherapeutic effects on other types of asthma and to investigate theunderlying molecular mechanisms involved.Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe medical condition associatedwith significant morbidity and mortality. It is characterized bydamage to the alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary capillaryendothelial cells, resulting from non-cardiogenic factors (Tanget al., 2023). The clinical manifestations of ALI include dyspneaand intractable hypoxemia, which can progress to severe respiratorydisorders. ALI is characterized by the infiltration of a large numberof neutrophils into lung tissue, leading to the release of inflammatorycytokines and damage to pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells.LPS, also known as endotoxin, is a major component of the outermembrane of Gram-negative microorganisms and is highlyFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org27Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888pathogenic (Liu et al., 2020). The ASA carbon nano-material hasdemonstrated its ability to inhibit the release of IL-6, IL-1β, andTNF-α inflammatory mediators in rat serum. Moreover, it has beenshown to reduce the increase of neutrophils in the blood.Additionally, it exhibits a decrease in the chemotaxis ofneutrophils to inflammatory sites and inhibits the injury andaggravation of LPS to lung tissue. These findings suggest thatASA carbon nano-material shows promising potential as acandidate treatment for ALI (Zhao Y. et al., 2022).In addition, amygdalin may also have therapeutic effects onchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Sun et al., 2020).COPD is characterized by airway remodeling, which involvesFIGURE 6Respiratory protection of Armeniacae semen amarum.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org28Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recent studies haveshown that amygdalin, administered at doses of 5, 10, and20 mg/kg, has a protective effect on the EMT process in COPDmice induced by cigarette smoke. These findings are consistent withthe observed inhibition of TGF-β1 protein expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation by amygdalin, indicating its potential role insuppressing the TGF-β/smad pathway. Moreover, amygdalin alsodemonstrates inhibitory effects on the EMT process in BEAS-2Bcells stimulated by cigarette smoke in vitro, suggesting its potentialuse in COPD treatment (Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore, themechanism by which amygdalin exerts its therapeutic effect mayalso be related to the inhibition of LPS-induced EMT and TLR4/NF-κB signaling cascade (Si and Zhang, 2021).Numerous formulas containing ASA have been extensivelystudied and utilized in the research and treatment of variousrespiratory diseases such as colds, asthma, COVID-19, andpulmonary fibrosis (Li et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2016; Sun et al.,2018; Bai et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). This further demonstrates thepotential respiratory protection activity of ASA (Table 5).4.8 Digestive system protectionLimited reports exist on the protective effects of ASA on thedigestive system. This section provides a summary of the protectiveeffects of ASA on the digestive tract and digestive glands (Table 5).Studies have shown that 400 mg/kg ASA can enhance the damagecaused by gamma-radiation of 5 Gy to the salivary glands of RattusNorvegicus, specifically affecting the acinar cells. This effect isprimarily attributed to the downregulation of EGF proteinexpression and the upregulation of TGF-β protein expression,indicating that ASA mitigates oxidative damage andinflammatory responses, thereby protecting against salivary glanddamage (Abdaulmoneam et al., 2023). In addition, ASA oil has beenfound to possess gastroprotective effects. In an ethanol-induced ratgastric ulcer model, ASA oil reduces the release of cytokines such asIL-6, increases levels of oxidative stress markers like SOD and CAT,decreases lipid oxidation, and inhibits mucosal cell apoptosis,demonstrating its gastroprotective properties. Recent researchalso suggests that amygdalin may have potential pancreaticprotective effects (Karaboğa et al., 2018). Intravenous injection of10 mg/kg amygdalin improves pancreatic fibrosis in rats withchronic pancreatitis induced by dibutyldichlorotin, as evidencedby reduced production of profibrotic growth factors and inhibitionof pancreatic stellate cell activation. The mechanism may involveimproved microcirculation through reduced endothelin-1expression and upregulated expression of calcitonin gene-relatedpeptide (Zhang et al., 2018). Similarly, ASA ethanol extract caninduce apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro (Aamazadehet al., 2020).In summary, ASA has been found to have a protective effect onparotid glands, pancreas and stomach. Its mechanism of action isbelieved to involve the inhibition of inflammatory response andoxidative stress, along with the induction of cell apoptosis. However,the specific substances responsible for the therapeutic effects of ASA arestill unidentified and the protective effects on other digestive organs anddigestive glands have not been defined, thus the protective effects ofASA on the digestive system need to be further investigated.4.9 Antidiabetic effectDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders thatposes a significant global health burden, affecting approximately6% of the population. The majority of diabetic patients (90%–95%) have type II diabetes, while the remaining have type Idiabetes. Currently, the options for DM treatment are limited,and long-term use of available drugs may result in severe sideeffects (Das and Chakrabarti, 2005). ASA has shown specificeffects on DM and offers a promising alternative treatmentoption due to its cost-effectiveness and easy accessibility. Bothin vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that theantidiabetic activity of ASA is primarily associated with itsability to enhance insulin secretion, leading to reduced bloodpressure and mitigation of oxidative stress (Table 5).In an alloxan-induced rat DM, ASA demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in blood glucose levels, an increase in bodyweight, a decrease in lipid peroxidation levels, and an increase inserum CAT levels. ASA significantly increased insulin levels after8 weeks, and exhibited an inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase,suggesting that its anti-diabetic properties may be attributed tothe reduction of oxidative stress caused by glucose, inhibition of α-glucosidase, and significant mediation by elevated insulin (Raafatet al., 2018). Interestingly, ASA also showed a significant reductionin glycosylated hemoglobin levels, indicating its potential to preventcomplications associated with DM. Higher levels of HemoglobinA1C (HbA1c) in diabetic patients are indicative of poorer regulationof blood glucose and an increased risk of diabetes-relatedcomplications (Klonoff, 2020). Furthermore, amygdalin wasfound to alleviate diabetic retinopathy, a complication of DM. Inhigh glucose-stimulated HRECs cells, 40 μM amygdalindemonstrated a significant inhibition on oxidative stress andferroptosis, evidenced by increased GSH/GSSG ratio, SOD, CAT,GPX4 activity and reduced MDA and ROS levels, as well assignificant downregulation of ferroptosis marker proteinsincluding RAS, TFR1, and ACSL4. Notably, the antidiabeticretinopathy effects of amygdalin were found to be associated withthe activation of the NRF2/ARE pathway, leading to the activation ofNRF2 and HO-1 and an increase in NQO1 protein expression (Liet al., 2023).Recently, the antihypertensive effects of natural chemicalconstituents of ASA have attracted great attention fromresearchers. A polypeptide, Arg-Pro-Pro-Ser-Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp-Gln-Glu, has been identified in ASA albumin lately. Thispolypeptide acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with an IC50 value of 205.50 μM.Additionally, it has exhibited positive antihypertensive effects onspontaneously hypertensive rats at concentrations of 100 and150 mg/mL. Although not as effective as 10 mg/kg captopril, thispolypeptide has led to a significant decrease in systolic and diastolicblood pressure (Qin et al., 2023). These findings suggest that thepolypeptide holds the potential for anti-DM effects and could beutilized in the development of anti-DM drugs. Furthermore, aneutral polysaccharide (AP-1), which has a triple helix structure,has recently been extracted from ASA. AP-1 primarily consists ofglucose, arabinose, galactose, and mannose. It has strong inhibitionof α-glucosidase enzyme and the ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS,and Hydroxyl free radicals in vitro (Peng et al., 2023). These findingsFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org29Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888indicate that AP-1 may serve as a natural anti-oxidant andhypoglycemic agent in the treatment of DM.4.10 Liver protectionOxidative stress is widely recognized as the underlying cause ofboth acute and chronic liver diseases (Cui et al., 2021). ASA, anatural source of plant antioxidants, shows promising potential forthe treatment of liver diseases. Recent studies have revealed thatamygdalin not only alleviates symptoms of Ehrlich ascites cancer butalso, helps prevent liver cancer and mitigate associated liver damagewhen combined with sorafenib. These hepatoprotective effects areattributed to the direct reduction of liver function indicators such asalanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), as well as the significantantioxidant activity of amygdalin (Attia et al., 2022). In addition,another study also suggests that the key role of ASA in liverprotection may be related to oxidative stress (Yurt and Celik, 2011).ASA has demonstrated hepatoprotective effects at various stagesof liver disease development. In the early stages, ASA exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, effectively inhibiting disease progression.The main component of ASA, amygdalin, not only inhibits excessiveoxidative stress and reduces the levels of liver injury-relatedenzymes, but also suppresses the production of TNF-α, IL-6 andIL-1β as well as the expressions of inflammation-related proteinssuch as iNOS and COX-2, thereby mitigating inflammatoryresponse and providing resistance against acute liver injury (Tanget al., 2019). Hepatic fibrosis, a compensatory pathophysiologicalprocess, occurs when the liver is damaged by chronic inflammation,leading to tissue degeneration, inflammatory infiltration, necrosis,and constant repair of liver collagen and extracellular matrix(Tsuchida et al., 2018). Amygdalin, the active ingredient of ASA,has been found to inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cellsinduced by transforming growth factors. It also reduces the secretionof cytokines and the levels of ALT and AST, exerting anti-inflammatory effects and protecting the liver from fibrosis(Zhang et al., 2022b). Moreover, amygdalin has a protectiveeffect on advanced liver failure. In the case of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 or5 mg/kg amygdalin has been found to reduce the area of necrosisin liver tissue, lower the levels of liver function-related indicatorsALT and AST, and decrease neutrophil and macrophage counts.These effects are associated with the inhibition of oxidative damage,increased protein expression of Nrf2/NQO1/HO1, phospho-AKT,and inhibition of the JNK/RIP3/MLKL signaling pathway (Zhanget al., 2022a).Overall, ASA and amygdalin have promising liver protectioneffects both in vivo and in vitro experiments due to their potent anti-oxidant activities (Table 5). However, further research is needed toexplore the potential of ASA as a therapeutic drug for different stagesof liver disease development (Figure 7).4.11 Kidney protectionASA has therapeutic effects on both renal cell carcinoma andchronic kidney disease, such as renal fibrosis (Table 5). The maincomponent of ASA, amygdalin, inhibits the proliferation andproduction of transforming growth factors in renal interstitialfibroblasts, which plays a crucial role in the development of renalinterstitial fibrosis (Bai et al., 2020). In a rat model of unilateralureteral obstruction, treatment with amygdalin at concentrations of3 and 5 mg/kg resulted in reduced renal damage and delayedprogression of renal interstitial fibrosis (Guo et al., 2013).However, the accumulation of hydrocyanic acid, a metabolite ofamygdalin in ASA, can lead to nervous system depression, limitingits application. Nevertheless, a study found that oral administrationof 2 g/kg ASA water extract to rats did not exhibit nephrotoxicity butincreased antioxidant activity, manifesting as increased levels ofrenal function indicators such as urea, creatinine and urea nitrogenas well as increased activities of anti-oxidant enzymes such as SODand GSH (Zehra and Naz, 2021). In short, although the metabolismof ASA can lead to the accumulation of toxic substances, its richnatural chemical components have shown promising effects in theresearch of various diseases. Further research is needed to fullyunderstand the impact of ASA on kidney diseases.4.12 Other pharmacological activitiesIn addition to its pharmacological effects described above, ASAoil also exhibits skin protective effects. It can inhibit the growth ofhuman keratinocytes and enhance their programmed cell death,making it a potential treatment option for psoriasis (Li et al., 2016).Furthermore, preliminary clinical studies have shown that massagewith ASA oil during early pregnancy can effectively reduce theformation of stretch marks (Timur Taşhan and Kafkasli, 2012).Additionally, ASA extract has demonstrated positive effects inrelieving symptoms of dry eye syndrome and dry keratitis (Kimet al., 2016; Hyun et al., 2019). Moreover, ASA has also been found topromote fracture healing (Ying et al., 2020; Trang et al., 2022) andregulate the immune system (Tian et al., 2016) (Table 5).5 Clinical applicationsThere is mounting evidence supporting the use of ASA in thetreatment of cough, lung, and other respiratory-related diseases.Studies have shown that ASA liquids can reduce the sensitivity of thetrachea to ammonia stimulation, thereby relieving cough andpromoting intestinal peristalsis (Gao et al., 2012). In a researchstudy investigating the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicinecompounds for treating COVID-19, a total of 166 compoundscontaining 179 traditional Chinese medicines were collected.Among the candidate prescriptions for COVID-19 treatmentselected through complex system entropy and unsupervisedhierarchical clustering, ASA ranked third in terms of frequencyof use and was included in the first formula (Luo et al., 2020).Furthermore, a data mining analysis examining traditional Chinesemedicine prescriptions for respiratory diseases analyzed562 prescriptions specifically targeting the respiratory system.The results revealed that ASA was utilized in 36.7% of theprescriptions, ranking second after Glycyrrgizae radix etrhizoma—roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Fabaceae),which was used in 47.2% of the prescriptions (Fu et al., 2013). TheseFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org30Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888findings suggest that ASA holds promise as an effective treatment forrespiratory diseases.The plant kingdom contains many substances that may have thepotential to prevent or treat human disease (Zhao et al., 2022b; Sunet al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023), but these bioactive components (suchas vitamins and alkaloids) usually show low bioavailability orbiological instability. Recently, various techniques for improvingdrug delivery have been developed to solve the problems ofbioavailability and stability.

Currently, a protein belonging to the 11Sglobulin family was isolated from ASA water extract. This protein iscomposed of three polypeptides connected by disulfide bonds. Uponheat treatment, these bonds rearrange, resulting in the formation ofa spherical-shaped dimer. The unique structure of this proteinmakes it a potential candidate for use as a nanocarrier. Itefficiently encapsulates paclitaxel with a maximum encapsulationefficiency of 92.6% and a maximum release of paclitaxel of 57.4%(Lin et al., 2020). Additionally, a recent study developed liposomesloaded with amygdalin using a molar ratio of Tween 60: cholesterol:dihexadecyl phosphate as 1: 2: 0.1. These liposome-loadedamygdalin formulations demonstrated significant effects inreducing tumor volume, decreasing epidermal hyperplasia, andeliminating edema in a rat tumor model induced by 7,12-dimethylphenanthrene. Surprisingly, the anti-tumor activity ofthese liposomes surpassed that of tamoxifen, a well-known anti-tumor drug (El-Ela et al., 2022). Moreover, a polypeptide extractedfrom ASA water extract has displayed the ability to form a complexwith zinc ions, exhibiting remarkablely lowering blood pressureeffect. This polypeptide shows promise for further development asan antihypertensive drug (Qin et al., 2023).Numerous studies have demonstrated that formula preparationscontaining ASA exhibit powerful therapeutic effects in the treatmentof lung disease, liver disease, eye disease, and other diseases,especially respiratory diseases. The ASA-containing formulas maysignificantly relieve symptoms such as fever, cough and runny nose.Table 6 provides a summary of ASA-containing formulations andtheir clinical applications as outlined in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia2020 edition.6 Toxicological effects includingadverse reactionsThe main toxic substance in ASA is hydrocyanic acid, which isproduced when amygdalin is metabolized. Amygdalin is brokendown by β-D-glucosidase into mandelonitrile, which further breaksdown into benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid. HCN is eventuallyabsorbed into the bloodstream, leading to cyanide poisoning. It isimportant to note that the toxic doses of amygdalin vary greatlydepending on the method of administration. The lethal dose ofamygdalin through intravenous injection in humans is 5 g, whileoral consumption is 0.5–3.5 mg/kg body weight (Song et al., 2016).When injected intravenously, amygdalin can bypass enzymatichydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in high bloodconcentration and detectable amygdalin in the plasma.Additionally, 80% of the injected amygdalin is absorbed by thebody within 24 h and eliminated through urine (He et al., 2020).Ingesting 50 ASA consecutively can cause poisoning symptoms inadults, whereas babies can be poisoned by consuming only 5–10(Chaouali et al., 2013). Cyanide poisoning can lead to rapidhemodynamic and neurological impairment. Studies have shownthat hydrocyanic acid can inhibit the activity of cytochrome oxidasein cell mitochondria, causing respiratory inhibition in tissue cellsand cell death due to hypoxia. The clinical manifestations of cyanidepoisoning depend on the route, duration, dose, and source ofexposure. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, respiratory failure, hypotension, arrhythmia, cardiacarrest, the odor of bitter almonds, and cherry red skin (Jaszczak-Wilke et al., 2021).Modern pharmacological research has revealed significantvariations in the toxicity of different extracted components ofASA (Table 7). One study found that the median lethal dose(LD50) of lyophilized ASA aqueous extract on Kunming micewas 29.9 g/kg (Song et al., 2016), while another study reported anLD50 of approximately 22.5 g/kg for raw ASA aqueous extract onKunming mice (Chen and Jia, 2012). However, a separate studyadministered ASA oil at a dosage of 10 mg/day to Wistar rats for13 weeks, and no adverse reactions or fatalities were observed(Gandhi et al., 1997). In contrast, when amygdalin was directlyadministered to Wistar rats, the rats exhibited quadriplegia, muscle-twitching, difficulty in breathing, apnea, and subsequent death, withan LD50 of 880 mg/kg (Adewusi and Oke, 1985). These findingsindicate that ASA oil does not exhibit obvious toxicity, whereas ASAwater or alcohol extract demonstrates strong toxicity. Furthermore,the toxicity of amygdalin alone is more significant than that of ASAwater or alcohol extract.β-D-glucosidase plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis process ofamygdalin. When amygdalin was administered alone, the IC50 ofHepG-2 was 458.10 mg/mL. However, co-administration ofamygdalin with β-D-glucosidase resulted in a more than 100-folddecrease in IC50 to 3.2 mg/mL, highlighting the critical role of β-D-glucosidase in the pathway of amygdalin poisoning (Zhou et al.,2012). Similarly, there was a notable difference in the IC50 values ofPC12 and MDCK cells when amygdalin was administered alone orin combination with β-D-glucosidase. The IC50 of PC12 cellsdecreased from 35.83 to 5.97 μM, and the IC50 of MDCK cellsdecreased from 63.97 to 3.93 μM (Song et al., 2016). Althoughamygdalin itself is stable, it becomes highly toxic after hydrolysisby β-D-glucosidase. Unfortunately, β-D-glucosidase is widelypresent in humans, animals, plant seeds, and microorganisms.Therefore, it is crucial to explore methods for attenuatingamygdalin poisoning and implementing preventive measures.Traditional Chinese medicine suggests that ASA should undergoprocessing before use to inhibit the activity of amygdalin andpreserve its properties. The 2020 edition of the ChinesePharmacopoeia states that the main methods for processing anddetoxifying ASA include the Clear fried method and the Chanmethod (Wei et al., 2023). It has been discovered that thecombined use of ephedare herba—herbaceous stems of Ephedrasinica Stapf (Ephedraceae) with ASA effectively reduces the toxicityof ASA without impacting the amygdalin content. When mice wereorally administered ASA alone, the LD50 was found to be 29.9 g/kg.However, when different ratios of ephedare herba and ASA (MX (4:1), MX (2:1), MX (1:1), MX (1:2), and MX (1:4)) were orallyadministered, the LD50 of mice was 87.9, 81.6, 81.4, 64.6, and59.3 g/kg respectively, indicating the detoxification effect of Ephedrasinica Stapf on ASA. Furthermore, the HPLC method was used tomeasure the difference in amygdalin content among the mentionedgroups above. The content of amygdalin in the ASA water extractwas found to be 11.77 mg/g. However, co-extraction with ephedradid not result in significant differences in the amygdalin content(Song et al., 2016).Another detoxification method for ASA has recently beenreported. The method involves soaking ASA powder in a 25%sodium chloride solution for 12 h, followed by rinsing with tapFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org32Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888TABLE 5 Anti-inflammation, cardiovascular protection, neuroprotection, respiratory and digestive system protection, antidiabetic, liver and kidneyprotection and other pharmacological activities of ASA.Extract/compoundCell line/model In vitro/In vivoDose Mechanisms ReferenceAnti-inflammationAmygdalin BLM-induced mice lung fibrosismodelIn vivo 4 mg/kg, i.p.

This process is repeated once,and then the ASA powder is soaked again in the 25% sodiumchloride solution for another 12 h. After rinsing until the liquid isclear, the ASA powder is dried at 45° for 36 h, resulting in thedetoxified ASA. This method effectively eliminates the toxiccomponent HCN and significantly reduces the levels ofantinutrient factors such as phytates, phytate phosphorus, andoxalate by 71.83%, 23.92%, and 38% respectively compared toraw ASA. The fat content and crude fiber content do not showsignificant changes. However, there is a reduction in the contents ofVitamin C, β-carotene, minerals, and protein to varying degrees(Tanwar et al., 2018). Overall, this method can be employed in ASAoil and functional food production. Nevertheless, further research isneeded to fully explore the medicinal potential of ASA andinvestigate the effects of different processing methods on ASA.7 Pharmacokinetic profileStudies on the pharmacokinetics of ASA primarily focus onamygdalin and its metabolite prunasin (Table 8).

After oral administration of ASAwater extract, amygdalin is rapidly absorbed with a Tmax at 0.5 h and aCmax at 223.6 ng/mL. Subsequently, a substantial amount of amygdalinis hydrolyzed to prunasin within a short time, with a Tmax of 0.58 h anda Cmax of 5,212.8 ng/mL (Song et al., 2015). The volume of distribution/bioavailability (Vz/F) of amygdalin is 196.8 L/kg, while the Vz/F ofprunasin is 15.9 L/kg, indicating that amygdalin exhibits high tissuedistribution specificity and may be concentrated in certain organscompared to prunasin (Helmy et al., 2013). Recent research revealedthat the concentration of amygdalin in lung tissue (309.335 ± 13.662 ng/g) was significantly higher than in plasma (44.774 ± 7.397), heart(23.693 ± 6.097), liver (43.391 ± 5.963), spleen (53.745 ± 6.584), andkidney (55.373 ± 4.467) (Yang et al., 2021), suggesting that amygdalinmay be concentrated in lung tissue. The elimination half-life (t1/2) ofamygdalin and prunasin are 1.15 ± 0.26 h and 2.21 ± 0.52 h,respectively. Similarly, the mean residence time (MRT) foramygdalin and prunasin are 1.33 ± 0.23 h and 1.57 ± 0.22 h,respectively (Song et al., 2015). This observation can be attributed tothe hydrolysis of β-D-glucosidase. Additionally, the clearance/bioavailability (CLz/F) of amygdalin is significantly higher at 121.1 ±31.4 L/kg·h compared to prunasin, which has a CLz/F of only 5.1 ±0.9 L/kg·h. This difference may be linked to the higher bloodconcentrations of prunasin. It is worth noting that amygdalin existsin two isomers, D and L, with the latter being stable only attemperatures higher than 40°C (Wahab et al., 2015). Afteradministration of ASA water extract, the plasma concentrations ofthe two isomers are almost the same, with values of 147.8 ± 34.9 and138.7 ± 32.4 ng/mL, respectively. However, their metabolites,D-Prunasin and L-Prunasin, exhibit significant differences inconcentration, with values of 2,101.4 ± 453.0 and 3,561.2 ±619.8 ng/mL, respectively. Importantly, the content of L-Prunasin isconsiderably higher than that of D-Prunasin, indicating stereoselectivemetabolism of amygdalin. Besides, the bioavailability of amygdalin wasfound to be only 0.19% ± 0.08% when orally administered to rats,TABLE 6 (Continued) The clinical uses of ASA.No. Formula name Main compositions Traditional and clinical uses Reference49 Gejie DingchuanCapsulesASA (stir-baked); Gecko; Perillae Fructus (stir-baked); Trichosanthis Semen; Ephedrae Herba:Gypsum Fibrosum; Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma;Asteris Radix et Rhizoma; Trionycis Carapax(processed with vinegar); Seutellariae Radix;Ophiopogonis Radix; Coptidis Rhizoma; Lilii Bulbus;Gypsum FibrosumPersistent cough in consumptive diseases andwheezing in the elderly due to lung heat with Yindeficiency, manifested as shortness of breath, heatvexation, fullness and oppression in the chest,spontaneous sweating, and night sweating50 Jieji Ningsou Pills ASA; Perillae Folium; Peucedani Radix; PuerariaeLobatae Radix; Platycodonis Radix; Pinelliae Rhizoma(processed); Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium; FritillariaeThunbergii Bulbus; Trichosanthis Radix;Scrophulariae Radix; Glycyrrhizae Radix et RhizomaCommon cold with fever, cough, and profuse sputumin children due to external contraction of wind-cold,and phlegm turbidity obstructing the lung51 Chaiyin Mixture ASA; Bupleuri Radix; Lonicerae Japonicae Flos;Scutellariae Radix; Pueraiae Lobatae Radix;Schizonepetae Herba; Artemisiac Annuae Herba;Forsythiae Fructus; Platycodonis Radix; MenthaeHaplocalyc is; Houttuyniae HerbaUpper respiratory tract infection due to externallycontracted wind-heat, manifested as fever, aversionto wind, headache, sore throat, sweating, stuffy andrunny nose, cough, reddened tongue tip and marginswith thin yellow coating52 Dahuang ZhechongPillsASA (stir-baked); Rhei Radix et Rhizoma(processed); Eupolyphaga Steleophaga (stir-baked);Hirudo (processed); Tabanus (removed from wingsand feet,stir-baked); Holotrichia Diomphalia (stir-baked); Toxicodendri Resina (calcined); PersicaeSemen; Scutellariae Radix; Rehmanniae Radix;Paconiae Alba Radix; Glycyrrhizae Radix et RhizomaAbdominal masses and amenorrhea due to internalstatic blood retention, manifested as abdominalmasses, scaly dry skin, dark complexion, tidal fever,emaciation, and amenorrhea53 Jinbei TankeqingGranulesASA (stir-baked); Fritillariae Thunbcrgii Bulbus;Lonicerae Japonicae Flos; Peucedani Radix; MoilCortex; Platycodonis Radix; Belamcandae Rhizoma;Ephedrae Herba; Chuanxiong Rhizoma; GlycyrrhizaeRadix et RhizomaCough, yellow thick greasy phlegm, wheezing causedby phlegm-heat obstructing the lung; Acute episodeof chronic bronchitis with the symptoms describedabove54 Fufang Yigan Pills ASA; Artemisiae Scopariae Herba; lsatidis Radix;Gentianae Radix; Chrysanthemi Indici Flos; TaraxaciHerba; Sophorae Tonkinensis Radix et Rhizoma; SediHerba; Cicadae Periostracum; Bovis CalculusArtifactus; Spica Prunellae; Plantaginis Semen;Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma; Picrorhizae Rhizoma;Moutan Cortex; Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix etRhizoma; Carthami Flos; Rhei Radix et Rhizoma;Cyperi Rhizoma; Citri Reticulatae ViridePericarpium; Aurantii Fructus; Arecae Semen;Gigeriae Galli Endothelium Cornrum; Ginseng Radixet Rhizoma; Cinnamomi Ramulus; SchisaindraeChinensis Fructus; Bupleuri Radix; GlycyrrhizaeRadix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum MellePanern of retained dampness-heat at toxin,manifested as distending pain in the hypochondria,jaundice, dry mouth, bitter taste in the mouth, yellowtongue coating and string-like pulse; Acute andchronic hepatitis with the symptoms described aboveFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org43Tang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1290888suggesting that amygdalin may have undergone degradation beforereaching the intestinal tract. In contrast, prunasin exhibited a higherbioavailability of 64.91% ± 6.30% when administered orally. Thesefindings indicate that amygdalin undergoes deglycosylationmetabolism(Zhang et al., 2022b).Changes in the oral dose of amygdalin lead to variations in itspharmacokinetic parameters. For instance, when rats were orallyadministered 5 mg/kg of amygdalin, the following parameters wereobserved: Tmax was 14 min, Cmax was 23.08 ng/mL, area under theplasma concentration curve (0-t) (AUC0–t) was 1,391.77 ng min/mL, area under the plasma concentration curve (0-∞) (AUC0-∞)was 1,569.22 ng min/mL, t1/2 was 28.76 min, and MRT was53.33 min (Zhang et al., 2022b).

Notably, there is little difference in Tmaxbetween the doses of 5 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, suggesting that theabsorption speed of amygdalin may not be affected by dosage.However, as the dose increases, Cmax, AUC, t1/2, and MRT ofamygdalin significantly increase. This indicates that higher doseslead to higher peak concentrations of amygdalin and slowerelimination, resulting in a longer presence of amygdalin in the body.Different drug-delivery routes have a significant impact on theabsorption, distribution, and elimination of amygdalin. Whenamygdalin is injected intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/kg, itreaches its Tmax within 2 min, while oral administration takes14 min. The Cmax after intravenous injection is 34,763.84 ±18,057.68 ng/mL, compared to only 23.08 ng/mL with oraladministration. These indicate that amygdalin is absorbed morerapidly and reaches higher peak plasma concentrations whenadministered intravenously. Furthermore, the volume ofdistribution (Vd) for intravenous injection and oraladministration is 680.71 ± 257.40 mL/kg and 140,028.28 ±27,425.92 mL/kg, respectively. This suggests that when amygdalinis administered intravenously, it is primarily distributed in theplasma, whereas after oral administration, it becomes moreTABLE 8 (Continued) Pharmacokinetic profiles of ASA.Animal Drug administrated Dose Compound Pharmacokinetic parameters ReferenceVd(mL/kg): 186,646.54 ± 74,474.47CL(mL/min/kg): 638.28 ± 167.77Prunasin (oral administration) 5 mg/kg Prunasin Tmax(min): 16.00 ± 5.48Cmax(ng/mL): 2912.06 ± 433.45AUC0–t(ng·min/mL): 134,797.34 ±13,091.48AUC0-∞(ng·min/mL): 135,731.78 ±12,982.12 ke(/min): 0.013 ± 0.005t1/2(min): 63.48 ± 31.17MRT(min): 46.80 ± 4.65Vd(mL/kg): 3369.66 ± 1,532.62CL(mL/min/kg): 37.02 ± 3.80F (%): 64.91 ± 6.30Prunasin (intravenousadministration)5 mg/kg Prunasin Tmax(min): 2.00 ± 0.00Cmax(ng/mL): 6926.50 ± 1952.91AUC0–t(ng·min/mL): 207,670.12 ±22,295.20AUC0-∞(ng·min/mL): 208,663.12 ±22,869.27 ke(/min): 0.010 ± 0.004t1/2(min): 69.42 ± 22.68MRT(min): 43.94 ± 3.33Vd(mL/kg): 2469.24 ± 979.45CL(mL/min/kg): 25.05 ± 2.293 males and 4 females aged63.3 ± 9.1 yearsAlmond skin polyphenols (oraladministration)450 mg Catechin Tmax(h): 1.4 ± 0.2 Chen et al.

Additionally, the t1/2 of intravenous administration(67.93 ± 24.72 h) is longer than that of oral administration (28.76 ±7.2 h), and the MRT of intravenous administration (39.42 ±5.95 min) is shorter than that of oral administration (53.33 ±10.05 min). These findings indicate that amygdalin remains inthe body for a longer duration when administered intravenously(Zhang et al., 2022b).In addition, the pharmacokinetics of flavonoids in ASA werealso investigated. After orally administering 450 mg of ASA skinpolyphenols, the plasma was found to contain catechin andnaringenin. The Tmax and Cmax values for catechin were 1.4 ±0.2 h and 44.3 ± 15.6 ng/mL, respectively. For naringenin, the Tmaxand Cmax values were 3.3 ± 0.5 h and 19.3 ± 8.2 ng/mL, respectively.Moreover, the Cmax of total flavonoids was 82.3 ± 17.6 ng/mL, whichexceeded the levels of catechin and naringenin. This suggests thepresence of other unidentified flavonoids in ASA.8 Conclusion and future perspectivesNatural medicinal plants have shown significant benefits intreating a range of diseases, including COVID-19 (Setayesh et al.,2022), respiratory diseases (Hajimonfarednejad et al., 2023), mentalhealth disorders such as anxiety and insomnia (Motti and de Falco,2021), hyperlipidemia (Hashempur et al., 2018), and commonfungal infections (Amini et al., 2023). These plants arecharacterized by their multi-component and multi-target nature,making them vital in the treatment of various illnesses. ASA, aChinese herbal medicine with a long history of medicinal use, is richin phytochemical ingredients, active substances, and nutrients. Itserves as both a medicinal drug and nutraceutical, with greatpotential for broad application.Here, we comprehensively reviewed the phytochemicalcomposition, pharmacological activities, clinical applications,toxicology, and pharmacokinetics studies of ASA. The presentstudy offers a comprehensive summary of the phytochemicalcomposition of ASA, categorizing it into distinct structural typesfor the first time. It also provides a systematic overview of thepharmacological activities and mechanism of action of ASA.Moreover, the study includes a novel compilation of variousdetoxification methods before ASA administration, along with ananalysis of the alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters after ASAadministration. The current research primarily focuses on assessingthe anticancer potential of various extracts of ASA and its maincomponent, amygdalin. To date, researchers have successfullyisolated and identified 170 chemical components from differentASA extracts. Extensive in vivo and in vitro pharmacological studieshave revealed that amygdalin and polyphenols in ASA possess awide range of pharmacological activities. Furthermore, ASA fatty oiland volatile oil also exhibit specific pharmacological activities in thetreatment of certain diseases.However, there are some aspects worth noting and requiringfurther research. 1) Amygdalin in ASA exhibits excellent anti-canceractivity in various cell lines. However, most studies conducted so farhave been in vitro, with only a few in vivo experiments. Therefore, morepreclinical research and translation into clinical studies are needed. 2) Itis important to note that ASA is toxic, as amygdalin can be metabolizedby β-D-glucosidase, leading to cyanide poisoning. There is limitedresearch on detoxification methods of ASA, and current methods mayresult in the loss of some active ingredients. Therefore, future researchshould focus on developing efficient detoxification methods that alsopreserve the therapeutic properties of ASA. 3) While more than170 chemical components have been identified in ASA, thepharmacological evaluation has been limited to a few compoundssuch as amygdalin, its metabolites, total polyphenols, and totalvolatile oils. Thus, there is an urgent need for in-depth studies onthe phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of ASA,particularly the mechanism of action of its bioactive components. 4)ASA and its compounds have shown promising therapeutic effects inthe treatment of respiratory diseases in both in vivo and in vitro studies.Some ASA-containing formula preparations have been included in the2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Therefore, furtherinvestigation into the pharmacological activities and mechanisms ofaction of these compounds is warranted. 5) Currently, there is a lack ofpharmacokinetic data on different ASA extracts and active compounds.Conducting more pharmacokinetic studies on crude ASA extracts andactive compounds is crucial for the rational clinical use anddevelopment of new drugs.ASA, a Chinese herbal medicine, is known for its medicinal andfood uses. It is rich in phytochemicals and nutrients, making itclinically valuable and potentially useful for food development.Further research is needed to investigate the pharmacologicalactivities of different components of ASA and understand theirunderlying mechanisms. This study offers a comprehensive analysisof ASA, providing valuable insights for researchers to improve theirunderstanding of ASA and promote the development of ASA as aclinical drug and healthy food.Author contributionsST: Conceptualization, Formal Analysis, Data curation,Investigation, Methodology, Writing–original draft.
