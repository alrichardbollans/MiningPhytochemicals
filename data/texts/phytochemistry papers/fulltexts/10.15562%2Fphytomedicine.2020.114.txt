ABSTRACT
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), medicinal plants 
represent the main product for both urban and rural populations 
for their health care needs due to the high costs of conventional 
medicine. These plant species contain bioactive compounds also 
called phytochemicals that are capable of modulating metabolic 
processes and resulting in the promotion of better health. In the 
present paper, the aims were to give updated infor mation on the 
physical properties, phytochemistry and pharmacological activities 
of L. multiflora, medicinal plant in Republic Democratic of the Congo 
(DR. Congo). A literature search of this specie was conducted to obtain 
information about the nutritional value, phytochemistry and biological 
activities from various electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed 
Central, Science Direct, Google scholar and Sci-hub). The chemical 
structures of L. multiflora naturally occurring compounds were drawn 
using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 software package. In this study, the 
bibliographic references were using bibliographic software Mendeley. 
L. multiflora Moldenke is a tropical to subtropical herbaceous aromatic 
plant widely distributed in West and Central Tropical Africa. It has 
been traditionally used in ethnomedecine against various disorders. 
It has been reported that the essential oil composition of L. multiflora 
from some locations were characterized by high terpenoids content, 
in particular: 1,8-cineole, linalool, geranial and neral, ipsdienone 
and (Z)- and (E)-ocimenone, thymol and thymyl acetate, p-cymene, 
sabinene, α-terpineol, α-phellandrene, myrcene and epoxymyrcene, 
myrtenol, limonene, (E)- and (Z)-tagetone and ipsenone, nerolidol, 
geraniol, γ-terpinene, (E)-caryophyllene, and β-farnesene). Many 
study reported that the plant possess various biological properties 
like anti-hypotensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-analgesic, anti-pyretic, 
anti-malaria, anti-oxydant, anti-microbial activities. The present 
review can therefore help inform future scientific research towards 
the development of novel drugs of relevance from L. multiflora for the 
improvement of human health and wellbeing.
Keywords: L. multiflora Moldenke, medicinal plants, photochemistry and pharmacological activities.
INTRODUCTION
Background
Historically, plants have been used for the treatment 
and prevention of various illnesses. With the revo-
lution of science, the popularity of herbal medicines 
has widened.1,2 World Health Organization (WHO) 
reports that 80% of the world’s population use 
herbal medicines for their primary healthcare.3-7 
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 
medicinal plants represent the main product for 
both urban and rural populations for their health 
care needs due to the high costs of conventional 
medicine.4,6 These plant species contain bioactive 
compounds or phytochemicals that are capable 
of modulating metabolic processes and resulting 
in the promotion of better health. Some of these 
plants act therefore as functional foods and could 
serve as sources of nutraceuticals.8 Lippia multiflora 
belonging to Verbenaceae family has diverse appli-
cation, ranging from treatment of respiratory to 
gastrointestinal disorders. Indeed, L. multiflora has 
been traditionally used to treat disease conditions 
like bronchial inflammation, venereal disease, 
malaria, conjunctivitis, gastro-intestinal distur-
bance, enteritis, etc., because of the perceived anti-
microbial properties.9 It has been reported that the 
essential oil composition of L. multiflora from some 
locations were characterized by high terpenoids 
content, in particular: 1,8-cineole, linalool, geranial 
and neral, ipsdienone and (Z)- and (E)-ocimenone, 
thymol and thymyl acetate, p-cymene, sabinene, 
α-terpineol, α-phellandrene, myrcene and epoxy-
myrcene, myrtenol, limonene, (E)- and (Z)-tagetone 
and ipsenone, nerolidol, geraniol, γ-terpinene, 
(E)-caryophyllene, and β-farnesene.10-15 Some other

Botany and geographic distribution 
L. multiflora Moldenke is a shrubby aromatic plant, 
growing up to 1.2 m with whitish flowers on cone-
like heads in a terminal panicle, and nearly 12 mm 
long.24 It is widely distributed in west and Central 
Tropical Africa.25 
METHODOLOGY
In this study, a literature search was conducted to 
obtain all information about the traditional uses, 
physical properties, phytochemistry and bioactiv-
ity of L. multiflora Moldenke (Verbenaceae) from 
various electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed 
Central, Science Direct and Google scholar). The 
scientific name of this plant species was used as the 
keyword for the search. The chemical structures of 
the L. multiflora naturally occurring compounds 
were drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 soft-
ware package but the bibliographic references were 
done using bibliographic software Mendeley.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Ethno-medicinal uses 
L. multiflora has a long history of traditional medic-
inal application some of which have scientific 
validation. This plant has a diverse application in 
ethnomed icine, ranging from treatment of respi-
ratory and gastrointestinal disorders. L. multiflora 
has been traditionally used to treat disease condi-
tions like bronchial inflammation, venereal disease, 
malaria, conjunctivitis, gastro-intestinal disturbance, 
enteritis, etc., because of the perceived antimicrobial 
properties.9 Various study reported the plant exhibit 
anti-malarial, spasmolitic, sedative, hypotensive and 
anti-inflammatory activities.26-29 Kanco et  al.30 and 
Pascual et al.31 reported this plant has been used in 
many traditional and herbal medicines to treat bron-
chial inflammation, malaria fever, conjunctivitis, 
gastro-intestinal disturbance, enteritis, coughs and 
colds and possesses hypotensive, fatigue-relieving, 
and diuretic properties. The Tea-like infusions is 
given as a malaria fever while crushed leaves are used 
against stress, hypertension, conjunctivitis, venereal 
diseases and as a laxative.32 The leaf infusion is also 
employed to treat a sudorific (diaphoretic) febrifuge. 
It forms part of various complex plant recipes for the 
treatments of sleeping sickness especially for severe 
jaundice.33 In Nigeria, leaves are used for constipa-
tion and as a febrifuge (antipyretic). L. multiflora 
tea is commonly consumed in Northern Nigeria as 
remedy for malaria fever. In Ghana, the leaf infusion 
of sun-dried leaves is consumed as tea with sugar or 
honey for stomach ailments.19,34 The study of Kunle 
et al.33 reported that, In Gambia, local beehives are 
smoked with this fragrant plant to attract settling of 
bees. This plant was also used by children in the form 
of an ointment and also for treating fever and consti-
pation.34 Other traditional medicinal uses include 
its application as an antimalarial infusion and the 
treatment of respiratory disorders.31
Photochemistry 
Some researchers have reported several known 
compounds and secondary metabolites. The 
phytochemical screening revealed the presence of 
almost the same phytochemical groups (cathetic 
and gallic tannins, flavonoids, anthocyanins, leuco-
anthocyanes, triterpenoids, mucilage, coumarins 
and the reducing compounds) in both leaves and 
flowers from all sites with variable abundances. 
Alkaloids were found only in leaves while steroids, 
quinone derivatives and combined anthracene 
C-heterosides were identified uniquely in flowers. 
Reports on the analysis of L. multiflora oil showed 
the presence of Carvacrol,35 α-Thujene, α-Pinene,

characterized by a high content in linear terpenes: 
nerolidol (45.2%), linalool (20.2%) and β-farnesene 
(10.5%); germacrene D, β-caryophyllene and 
1-8-cineol were important minor components.

Physico-Chemical Properties Of Essential 
Oil
Kunle et al.9 reported in literature, the reports on 
the physical properties of the oil are limited and 
vary widely. The variability is thought to be as a 
result of variation in chemical component due to

and genetic factors.24 Oladimeji et al.19 and Juliani 
et al.14 reported a widely varied yield for the oil. In a 
study of the seasonal variability of the oil yield from 
the plant in the authors’ laboratory, it was revealed 
that the plant exhibits seasonal variability in its oil 
content between January and June with the highest 
yield of 1.57% in June.33 
Biological Activities
Biological activities of extracts and molecules of 
L. multiflora are summarized in table 2. 
Antimalarial activity
Alexis et  al.22 reported that the oil of L. multi-
flora was tested for antimalarial activity on in 
vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum (FcB1-
Columbia chloroquine-resistant strain and 
F32-Tanzania chloroquine-sensitive strain). The 
dilutions inhibiting the in vitro growth of the para-
site by 50% 24 and 72 hr after administration of the 
essential oil to the parasite culture were 1/12000 
and 1/21000, respectively. When tested on a highly 
synchronized culture, the essential oil inhibited 
growth mostly at the trophozoite-schizont step, 
indicating a potential effect on the first nuclear 
division of the parasite.
Muscle relaxant properties
Noamesit et al.21 reported, aqueous leaf extracts of 
this specie administered intraperitoneally produced 
a profound calming effect, muscle relaxing action, 
and significant reduction in the spontaneous loco-
motor activity of mice measured in the Ugo Basile 
activity cage. The extract (0.25-1.0 g Kg-1 reduced 
amphetamine induced locomotor activity in mice. 
The extract (0.5-1.0 mg ML-1) inhibited contrac-
tions of the isolated rat diaphragm in response to 
the phrenic nerve stimulation. The muscles relaxant 
effect was considered to be primarily responsible 
for the calming effect, bordering on tranquilizing 
activity observed in mice and rats. In another work, 
a lyophilisated powder obtained from an infusion 
of dried leaves of L. multiflora Moldenke caused a 
muscle relaxant effect (in the traction test).28
Analgesic and antipyretic properties 
Abena et al.35 reported that at the doses used (2, 4 
and 8 mL/kg o.s.) the essential oil of L. multiflora 
showed significant and dose-dependent analgesic 
effect on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice. 
Only the dose of 8 mL/kg of essential oil, antag-
onized hyperexia induced by brewer’s yeast. No 
effect on granuloma formation was observed. In 
another work, Abena et al.40 demonstrated that the

essential oil exhibited more analgesic activity than 
the crude extract while the crude extract was more 
effective as a muscle relaxant.40 An analgesic activ-
ity (by using acetic acid and hot plate methods), but 
did not cause modification of rectal temperature.28
Antimicrobial properties
The essential oils were also tested against 09 strains 
using a broth micro-dilution method. The Gram 
negative bacteria were the most sensitive. The 
essential oil of this plant was the most active.38 The 
antimicrobial activity of carvacrol and thymol, 
which were the major components of the oil has 
also been reported.23,17 Mevy et al.16 reported the oil 
exhibited strong inhibitory effect on the growth of 
Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus hirae, and a 
moderate effect was observed for Candida albicans 
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Hypotensive effects
In a previous study, the hypotensive effects of 
L. multiflora were confirmed, its methanolic extract 
was found to be more active than its aqueous 
extract in normotensive rats.27 In the Ivory Coast, 
L. multiflora is used as an infusion for the treatment 
of hypertension.41
Sedative effect
Additionally, the essential oil of L. sidoides Cham., 
the infusion of L. multiflora Moldenke and different 
L. alba (Mill.) N.E. Brown extracts, shows a sedative 
effect.28,42,43
Antioxydant activity
Hanson et  al.20 reported the on-line DPPH (2, 
20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical) scavenging 
assay (reaction time = 0.45 s) applied to the infusion 
in ‘‘quantitative’’ mode, showed the relative order 
of activity: isonuomioside A > isoverbascoside 
> verbascoside > nuomioside A. In the microplate 
assay (reaction time = 2 h), isover- bascoside and 
verbascoside had similar activity. Both compounds 
were less active in the latter assay than the well-
known flavan-3-ol antioxidant, (-)-epigallocate-
chin gallate, but more active than caffeic acid and 
an ester, rosmarinic acid. Steam pasteurisation of 
L. multiflora leaves at maximum exposure (150  s 
at ca 99°C) for improved microbial quality did 
not decrease the soluble solids content, phenolic 
content and antioxidant activities of the infusion 
compared to the untreated control (p < 0.05).
Anti-inflammatory activity
Various study demonstrated two monoterpenes 
(thymol and citral) have anti-inflammatory prop-
erties both in vitro and in vivo. This pharmacolog-
ical activity is based on : inhibition of NF-kappa-B 
pathway activation, decreased expression of iNOS 
(inducible nitric oxide synthase), decreased NO 
(nitric oxide) production and NO scavenging.44-46 
Therefore the anti-inflammatory effects of two 
essential oils with different chemotypes derived 
from L. multiflora Mold harvested during March 
2012 were examined, upon activated macrophages 
using nitric oxide (NO) as a biological marker
Scabicidal activity
In Nigeria, scabicidal activities of two topical emul-
sion formulations (Lippia oil emulsions A and B), 
each containing 20% w/w essential oil of L. multi-
flora , were compared with that of benzyl benzo-
ate emulsion BP using randomized, double blind 
and group parallel studies. The percentage cure 
obtained for Lippia oil emulsion A were 50%, 80% 
and 80% on application for 3, 5 and 7 days, respec-
tively, compared with 30%, 60% and 70% obtained 
for benzyl benzoate emulsion BP for the same treat-
ment periods. There was no significant difference 
between the percentages of scabietic subjects cured 
with the two formulations (A and B) of Lippia oil 
(P > 0.05). Six adverse effects were reported for the 
Lippia oil emulsions, while 10 adverse effects were 
reported for benzyl benzoate emulsion BP. Since 
the Lippia oil emulsions were more effective and 
better tolerated than the benzyl benzoate emulsion, 
they were considered as additional formulations for 
the treatment of scabies.19 The lethal effect of the 
lippia oil on headlice was increased when applied 
in an enclosed system that prevented volatilization 
of the oil while allowing maximum contact of the 
vapour with the headlice. A 20% v:v preparation of 
lippia oil applied to scabietic subjects for 5 consec-
utive days gave 100% cure compared with 87.5% 
cure obtained for benzyl benzoate preparation of 
the same concentration. The GC-MS analysis of oil 
revealed, among others, the presence of terpineol, 
a- and b-pinene which are known to be lethal to 
body and headlice.18
Toxicity degree of lippia multiflora
Djengue et  al.39 reported the extracts from both 
leaves and flowers showed positive action on 
shrimp larvae but with CL50 of (13.28±1.52 mg/mL 
for leaves; 0.46±0.05 mg/mL for flowers) superior 
to 0.1mg/mL, hence indicating the non-toxicity of 
L. multiflora.
CONCLUSION
The plant species contain bioactive compounds 
that are capable of modulating metabolic processes 
and resulting in the promotion of better health. 
In the present mini-review, the aim was to give 
updated infor mation on the traditional uses,

physical properties, phytochemistry and pharma-
cological activities of L. multiflora, medicinal plant 
in Republic Democratic of the Congo (DR. Congo). 
The literature survey revealed that L. multiflora is 
a pharmacologically and chemically much studied 
plant species, although the diversity of secondary 
metabolites present in this plant species is enor-
mously various.
