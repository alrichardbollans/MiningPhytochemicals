ABSTRACT 
Ethnopharmacological relevance: Securidaca longipedunculata Fresen 
(Polygalaceae) is a multi-purpose plant with a long history of use in African 
traditional medicine to treat various sexually transmitted infections, hernias, coughs, 
fever, ascariasis, constipation, headaches, rheumatism, stomach ache, malaria, 
tuberculosis, pain, epilepsy, pneumonia, skin infections, and it is also used as an 
aphrodisiac for men. The current paper provides an overview of the present 
phytochemistry, toxicology, ethnomedicinal uses and pharmacological properties of 
S. longipedunculata.  
Materials and methods: The information reported in this paper was collected from a 
literature search using various computerised databases including ScienceDirect, 
  2     
 
Scopus, Scielo, PubMed and Google Scholar. The extra information was sourced 
from various academic dissertations, theses and botanical books. 
Results: Phytochemically, extracts from various parts of S. longipedunculata, 
especially the root bark, contain numerous valuable compounds including 
xanthones, some benzyl benzoates and triterpene saponins amongst others. Toxicity 
studies, both in vivo and in vitro, revealed that extracts are only toxic at relatively 
high concentrations. Furthermore, extracts have antimicrobial, antioxidant, 
antiparasitic, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, insecticidal, pesticidal, and 
anticonvulsant properties.  
Conclusions: S. longipedunculata is an important plant species with potential 
benefits in the treatment of transmissible and infectious diseases, including malaria, 
tuberculosis, and those caused by community acquired microorganisms. Although 
extracts from this species generally have little toxicity at low concentrations, further 
efforts are required to investigate the potential toxicity of S. longipedunculata. The 
antimicrobial properties of extracts and purified compounds against microorganisms 
causing sexually transmitted infections is also deserving of further research. 
Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of extracts and compounds of the species 
need to be explored as there is insufficient data available on these aspects.

1. Introduction 
Medicinal plants serve as a source of medicines in a variety of communities for the 
treatment of numerous pathogenic infections, tonics for general wellbeing, as spices 
and condiments and for magical purposes. Some African medicinal plants have been 
ethnobotanically and scientifically implicated in the treatment of a variety of human 
infections (Van Wyk and Albrecht, 2008; Ojewole et al., 2010; Mongalo and Mafoko, 
2013; Mongalo 2013; Zongo et al., 2013). The pharmacology of these plants may be 
attributed to various classes of compounds occurring within these plants.  
 
The genus Securidaca comprises about 80 species, characterised by 
papillionaceous purplish flowers and mostly scandent shrubs and lianas, which 
produce compounds known as securixanthones with antimicrobial and antioxidant 
properties (Wallnӧfer, 1998; Yang et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2003, Da Costa et al., 
2013). Although protected under provincial and national legislation, S. 
longipedunculata stem bark and roots are still found amongst the most traded 
medicinal plants in Africa (Moeng, 2010; Tabuti et al., 2012). The species is 
threatened by various anthropogenic and environmental conditions including 
  5     
 
seasonal fires, droughts, and debarking (Oni et al., 2014).  The current paper is 
aimed at highlighting the phytochemical constituents, pharmacology, indigenous 
ethnobotanical uses, and toxicity of S. longipedunculata – an important multipurpose 
African medicinal plant.  
 
2. Materials and Methods 
The information reported in this paper was collected from a literature search using 
various computerised databases including ScienceDirect, Scopus, Scielo, PubMed 
and Google Scholar. Additional information was retrieved from various academic 
dissertations, theses and botanical books. Key words such as Securidaca 
longipedunculata, ethnomedicinal uses, antimicrobial activity, pharmacological 
properties, cytotoxicity, phytochemistry, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties, 
anti-diabetic, antimalarial, pesticidal effect, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, anti-convulsant 
and insecticidal effect were used. 
 
3. Description and ethnomedical uses 
3.1 Botanical description and distribution 
Securidaca longipedunculata Fresen (synonyms Securidaca longipedunculata var. 
longipedunculata or Elsota longipedunculata, family Polygalaceae) is a small tree up 
to 6 meters high with a pale grey, smooth bark and oblong, more or less hairless 
alternate leaves that are variable in size and shape and crowded towards the stem 
tips (Van Wyk et al., 2009). Clustered flowers are small, pink to lilac or purple in 
colour, sweet scented and are produced in early summer (Van Wyk et al., 2005). 
Fruits are a round nut, heavily veined, occasionally smooth, oblong, purplish green 
when young and possess a membranous wing of about 4 cm long (Coates-Palgrave, 
  6     
 
2005). The species is mostly distributed in various tropical African countries, 
including Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, 
Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra 
Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, 
as well as in the North West and Limpopo Provinces of South Africa (Baloyi and 
Tshisikhawe, 2009; Tshisikhawe et al., 2012). 
 
3.2 Local names 
In South African languages, the plant species is called violet tree, fiber tree, or 
Rhodesian violet (English), krinkhout (Afrikaans), umfufu (Ndebele), mupesu 
(TshiVenda) and mmaba in both Sotho and Tswana. In other African countries, 
various names in different cultural and ethnic groups have been used: es a manahi 
(Amharic); saggat, alali (Arabic); mwinda (Lozi); mutata (Lunda); mwinda, mpuluka 
(Nyanja); mupapi (Bemba); lilo (Luganda); uwar magunguna, sanya (Hausa); yodo, 
juto, jodo (Mandinka); mufufu (Shona); muteya, mzigi, Chipvufana, mufufu, 
munyapunyapu, munyazvirombo, mutangeni, umfufu (Swahili); shotora (Tigrigna); 
njefu, bwazi, mufufuma (Tongan); fouf (Wolof); ipeta (Yoruba) (Orwa et al., 2009). 
 
3.3 Ethnomedicinal uses 
The major ethnomedicinal uses of S. longipedunculata in different countries are 
documented in Table 1. These suggest that the most commonly used plant part is 
the root and that the species is used in the treatment of a variety of ailments 
including coughs, fever, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases in 
  7     
 
different geographical areas. This provides support for a pharmacological basis of 
the use of the plant species in the treatment of such ailments.

3.3.1 Roots 
 
The smoke resulting from burning the root of S. longipedunculata, combined with 
that of Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides, is inhaled to treat malaria and fever (Hamill et 
al., 2003). A root decoction may also be drunk to treat fever, malaria, hernias, 
gonorrhoea, palpitations, headaches, oedema, rheumatism, diabetes, sexual 
impotence, toothache, fungal infections and malaria (Maroyi, 2013; Ogunmefun and 
Gbile, 2012; Chhabra et al., 1991; Moshi et al., 2007). 
 
An infusion of the soaked root bark may be drunk as an aphrodisiac or mixed with 
other medicines and used as an emetic (Mabogo, 1990). Alternatively, a root 
decoction may be drunk in beer as an aphrodisiac (Motlhanka and Nthoiwa, 2013). 
The root bark is pulverised in water and the resulting mixture is inhaled or used to 
wash the head, treating excessive headache (Nordeng et al., 2013). A handful of 
roots are combined with the roots of Sphedamnocarpus pruriens subsp. pruriens for 
treating people believed to be possessed by evil spirits while the powdered root is 
mixed with porridge and eaten to treat epilepsy and convulsions (Sobiecki, 2008). 
The decoction from the root is drunk or applied topically to treat cancer (Ashidi et al., 
2010). 
 
Roots may also be ground into powder form, dissolved in water and taken orally for 
constipation, pneumonia, back ache, blood purification, sexually transmitted 
infections and as an aphrodisiac (Viol, 2009). Dried roots are soaked in water, along 
with Citrus aurantifolia and the resulting juice is taken orally for three days to treat 
  9     
 
constipation while the dried root is boiled in distilled water along with that of Annona 
senegalensis and used to treat pneumonia (Mustapha, 2013a). Moreover, the dried 
root is ground into powder, along with that of Parkia biglobosa and then taken with 
cow’s milk as a sexual boost. The pounded root may be mixed with that of 
Zanthoxylum humile and taken with soft porridge to treat erectile dysfunction 
(Semenya and Potgieter, 2013). 
 
3.3.2 Leaves 
Fresh leaves are made into paste with little or no water along with the bark of 
Gardenia erubescens and applied externally twice a day for sixty-three days to treat 
skin cancer (Mustapha, 2013a). Moreover, fresh leaves are made into paste with 
little or no water along with leaves of Jussiaea suffruticosa and shea butter and the 
resulting mixture is applied externally, twice a day to treat a variety of skin infections.  
Dry leaves are also ground into powder and put into the fire and the resulting smoke 
is inhaled to treat headaches while the boiled leaves are taken orally for 
contraceptive purposes (Mustapha, 2013b). The leaves are either chewed fresh or 
both orally and nasally administered to treat epilepsy, headaches, stomach ache, 
infertility, snakebite, toothache and to expel the placenta (Augustino et al., 2011). 
 
3.3.3 Whole plant 
One cup from a whole plant decoction may be taken orally three times a day for 
three to four days to treat malaria (Nguta et al., 2010a; Nguta et al., 2010b). The 
decoction of the whole plant may either be drunk or used to wash the mouth and 
treat infections which include oral candidiasis, excessive coughing and other 
opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS (Chinsembu and Hedimbi, 2010). 
  10     
 
 
3.3.4 Stem bark 
A spoonful of powdered stem bark is mixed with Mondia whitei (stem bark), Uvaria 
afzelii (root bark), Allium ascalonicum (bulb) and Parkia biglobosa (seeds) and then 
taken with hot porridge to treat a variety of viral infections (Borikini et al., 2013). The 
dried bark is ground into a powder and taken orally with cow’s milk or porridge for 
fourteen days to treat dysentery (Mustapha, 2013a). A decoction from the stem bark 
may be taken orally to treat stomach ache, headaches, inflammation, chest 
complaints, abortion, jaundice, ritual suicide, constipation, snake bites, infertility 
problems, epilepsy and venereal diseases (Das, 2009; Bruschi et al., 2011; 
Oladunmoye and Kehinde, 2011; Kadiri et al., 2013). The powdered stem bark is 
also mixed with hot water and taken orally to treat syphilis and gonorrhoea (Hedimbi 
and Chinsembu, 2012). 
 
4. Phytochemistry 
Some of the compounds isolated from S. longipedunculata are shown in Fig. 1. The 
volatile oil of the roots contains large amounts of methyl salicylate (Van Wyk et al, 
2005). The report agrees with those of Jayasakara et al. (2002) and Lognay et al. 
(2000), which revealed that the major component (over 90%) of the volatile material 
from the root bark is methyl-2-hydroxybenzoate (methyl salicylate). Furthermore, 
securinine, presenegenin, 2-hydroxybenzoate esters such as methyl 2-hydroxy-6-
methoxybenzoate and its benzyl analogue were also reported. In general, most 
classes of compounds have been isolated from the roots, using a variety of solvents 
(Table 2). This may well explain the ethnomedicinal uses and hence the biological 
activity of the plant species.

The aqueous root and ethanol extracts yielded alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, 
flavonoids, saponins, tannins, volatile oils, terpenoids and some steroids (Junaid et 
  17     
 
al., 2008; Haruna et al., 2013a; Auwal et al., 2012; Gbadamosi, 2012) while 
chloroform and ethanol extracts indicated flavonoids, saponins, coumarins, tannins 
and alkaloids (Adebayo and Osman, 2012). The ethyl acetate fraction of the root 
contained compounds such as 1,5-dihydroxy-3,4,6,7,8-pentamethoxyxanthone, 1,7-
dihydroxyxanthone, 5-Ο-prenyl-1-hydroxy-2,3,6,7,8-pentamethoxyxathanthone, 2-
hydroxy-1, 7-dimethoxyxanthone, β-sitosterol, 1,7-dihyroxy-4-methoxyxanthone, 
quercetin-3-O-β-galacto-pyranoside and 3-hydroxy-6-methoxysalicylic acid (Meli et 
al., 2007). The compounds 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-2,5-dimethoxyxanthone and 1,6,8-
trihydroxy-2,3,4,7-tetra-methoxyxanthone were also isolated from the acetone 
extract of the fresh root bark (Meyer et al., 2008). Moreover, the hexane extract of 
the root indicated the presence of 1,5-dihydroxy-2,3,6,7,8-pentamethoxyxanthone, 2-
hydroxy-l, 7-dimethoxyxanthone and 1,6-dihydroxyxanthone (Lannang et al., 2006). 
 
The water and aqueous methanol extracts from the root yielded a variety of 
compounds in varying amounts, including gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, 
epicatechic acid, rutin, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, apigenin, quercetin glucosyl 
and quercetin dihydrate (Muanda et al., 2010). Four highly oxygenated xanthones, 
muchimangins A-D, with a diphenylmethyl substituent have also been isolated from 
the root as minor constituents (Dibwe et al., 2012). The dichloromethane extract of 
the root bark yielded 4-methoxy-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-phenyl methanone and three 
other known compounds namely 1,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxyxanthone, benzyl-2-
hydroxy-6-methoxybenzoate and methyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxybenzoate (Joseph et 
al., 2006). The chloroform extract of the root contained compounds such as 2-
methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzophenone, benzyl 2-hydroxy-6-methoxybenzoate, 
6-hydroxy-2-methoxy benzoic acid, 1,6,8-trihydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetramethoxyxanthone, 
  18     
 
1,6-dihydroxy-2,3,4,5,8-pentamethoxyxanthone, 8-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetramethoxy-2,3-
methylenedioxyxanthone-4,6,8-trihydroxy,1,2,3,5-tetramethoxyxanthone, 4,8-
dihydroxy-1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxyxanthone, benzyl 3-hydroxy-2-methoxybenzoate 
and some other xanthones (Dibwe et al., 2013).  
 
Triterpene saponins such as 3-Ο-β-D-glucopyranosyl presenegenin 28-Ο-β-D-
apiofuranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→4)-[β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→3)]-α-L-
rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-{4-Ο-[(E)-3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyl]}-β-D-fucopyrano ester 
and three other related esters have been isolated from the 70% aqueous methanol 
root extract (Mitaine-Offer et al., 2010).  
 
Besides sinapoic acid, caffeic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoyl-D-quinic acid, 3,4,5-tricaffeoyl-D-
quinic acid and a considerable number of monosaccharide and polysaccharide 
conjugates, the methanol extract of the stem bark revealed the two bitter principles 
β-D-(3,4-disinapoyl)(fructofuranosyl-α-D-(6-sinapoyl)glucopyranoside and β-D-(3-
sinapoyl)(fructofuranosyl-α-D-(6-sinapoyl)glucopyranoside (De Tommasi et al., 
1993). Although many compounds have been isolated from the root and root bark, 
there is a need to further explore the phytochemistry of the stem bark and leaves of 
the species.  
 
5. Toxicology 
The aqueous root bark extract was slightly toxic to albino rats with an LD50 of 0.771 
g/kg (Auwal et al., 2012), while Agbaje and Adekoya (2012) reported an LD50 of 3.16 
g/kg when administered orally to rats. Moreover, acute toxicity studies of the 
aqueous whole root extract on mice revealed LD50 values of 1.740 g/kg and 0.020 
  19     
 
g/kg for the oral and intraperitoneal application routes respectively (Adeyemi et al., 
2010), while Dapar et al. (2007) reported an LD50 of 0.037 g/kg when aqueous root 
extracts were administered orally to albino rats (Sprague Dawley strain). Elsewhere, 
the 80% ethanol extract of the root bark exhibited an LD50 of 0.547 g/kg against 
albino mice (Keshebo et al., 2014).These findings may well suggest that the root 
bark extract has greater acute toxicity than the whole root extract following oral 
administration. In a repeated dose toxicity study, there was no mortality observed 
when varying doses of 0.3, 0.9 and 2.7 g/kg of the aqueous root extract were 
administered orally on a daily basis for a period of 28 days to Swiss albino mice 
(Etuk et al., 2006). Besides the method of preparation of the extracts, the difference 
in LD50 may be due to differences in collection site, geographical area and the 
season of collection. However, there is no data in the literature on the administration 
of various isolated compounds from S. longipedunculata to mice or rats. 
 
In the brine shrimp bioassay, the 70% methanol extract of the root exhibited a 100% 
mortality rate at a concentration of 1000 µg/ml (Adiele et al., 2013), while the 80% 
methanol root extract exhibited an LC50 of 77.1 µg/ml (Moshi et al., 2007), 
suggesting that these extracts are relatively toxic. However, the brine shrimp assays 
have some problems as the counting of the viable larvae is performed while the live 
larvae are continually moving around the petri dish. 
 
The aqueous root bark extract was toxic to Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with a 
mortality rate of 82.5 % at 1000 µg/ml and an IC50 of 67 µg/ml (Lawal et al., 2012). 
Compounds such as 1,6,8-trihydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetramethoxyxanthone and 1,6-
dihydroxy-2,3,4,5,8-pentamethoxyxanthone showed potent cytotoxicity with IC50 
  20     
 
values of 22.8 and 17.4 µM respectively against human pancreatic cancer cells 
(Dibwe et al., 2013) while the 70% methanol extract of the root bark exhibited 
average inhibition of cell proliferation of 22.6 % at a concentration of 1 µg/ml against 
HeLa cells (Runyoro et al., 2005). However, this is not a useful result, when 
compared to the IC50 which will explain the overall average concentration at which 
50% of the cells will be inhibited by the test plant extract. In summary, S. 
longipedunculata extracts have been investigated for cytotoxicity against human 
pancreatic cell lines, brine shrimp larvae, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, Hela cells and 
both albino rats and mice. However, there is a need to investigate the cytotoxicity of 
various extracts and some compounds isolated from this species against normal 
human cell lines. 
 
6. Pharmacology 
The pharmacological properties of S. longipedunculata extracts are summarized 
briefly in Table 3.  
 
6.1 Antibacterial activity 
In a recent disc diffusion study, the aqueous leaf extract yielded zones of inhibition 
(ZI) of 15 mm against both Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi, while the 
chloroform leaf extracts exhibited a ZI of 18 mm against Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
at a concentration of 7.5 mg/disc (Ndamitso et al., 2013). The methanol extracts and 
the chloroform fraction of the root bark exhibited ZI of 28 mm against methicillin 
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, while hexane and ethyl acetate fractions exhibited 
ZI ranging from 14 to 19 mm against Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas 
fluorescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Musa et al., 2013). Adebayo and Osman 
  21     
 
(2012) reported a ZI of 15.10 mm by the ethanol extracts of the root bark at a 
concentration of 100 mg/ml. The disc diffusion assay is not a good method in 
comparing the antibacterial activity of the plant extracts as it is dependent upon a 
number of factors, including the concentration of the bacterial inoculum, the type of 
agar used and the diffusion rate of the plant extract. These factors may well affect 
the activity of the extracts. However, it may be used as a starting point in comparing 
the antibacterial activity of various plant extracts.

In the broth microdilution assay, the chloroform extracts of the leaf had a minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.591 mg/ml against both S. typhi and P. 
aeruginosa while the aqueous extracts of the leaf revealed MIC of 6.25 mg/ml and 
minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 62.5 mg/ml against S. typhi. Besides 
exhibiting a MIC of 0.313 and MBC of 0.625 mg/ml against both Staphylococcus 
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the acetone extract of the root had a total 
activity of 19 200 ml/g against these bacterial strains (Ndamitso et al., 2012), 
suggesting that the extract may be a good source of antibacterial compounds. The 
units of total activity are ml/g and indicate the degree to which the active compounds 
in one g of plant material can be diluted and still inhibit the growth of the tested 
microorganism (Eloff, 2000). The extract of the acetone soluble portion of the root 
exhibited a potent MIC of 0.02 mg/ml against Bacillus subtilis and S. typhi (Ajali and 
Chukwurah, 2004). Moreover, a similar extract exhibited MIC of 0.10 mg/ml against 
both E. coli and P. aeruginosa.   
 
In other reports, the essential oil from S. longipedunculata had MIC of 12.79 mg/ml 
against E. coli (Alitonou et al., 2012), while the 70% methanol extract of the leaves 
exhibited a MIC of 0.45 mg/ml and 0.23 mg/ml against Serratia marcescens and 
Shigella flexneri respectively (Karou et al., 2012).  
 
The n-hexane extract of the root exhibited MIC values ranging from 0.0312 to ˃0.250 
mg/ml against Mycobacterium species such as M. smegmatis, M. tuberculosis, M. 
bovis and M. avium (Luo et al., 2011; Ferreira et al., 2012). Moreover, an acetone 
extract of the leaf was reportedly less active against two Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
strains, with MIC of ˃0.1 mg/ml compared to the reference drug (isoniazid) which 
  29     
 
exhibited a MIC of 0.0001 and 0.005 mg/ml (Green et al., 2010). The result of ˃0.1 
mg/ml is not useful information as it cannot be compared to information from other 
authors. In general, it is difficult to assess the biological activity of S. 
longipedunculata against M. tuberculosis as there is sparse information available. 
Moreover, there is a need to further investigate the biological activity of the various 
extracts of these species and some of the individual isolated compounds against M. 
tuberculosis. Elsewhere, water extracts of the root bark exhibited MIC of 1000 mg/ml 
against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa using the cylinder plate technique (Lino 
and Deogracious, 2006). Although there are differences in methods, the antibacterial 
activity of the aqueous root extract is not comparable to those of the organic extracts 
as Ngonda et al (2012) reported a MIC of 3.13 mg/ml of the aqueous extract against 
both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Some of the active compounds in the aqueous 
extract might have been destroyed by the freeze drying process. In general, crude 
extracts with MIC values of 0.1 mg/ml and below are held to be potent and worthy of 
further studies (Eloff, 1998). In the current work, various extracts from S. 
longipedunculata revealed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, 
M. smegmatis, M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. avium. These pathogens are 
important causative agents of various human infections. 
 
6.2 Antifungal activity 
Recently, it was reported that the 70% methanol extract of the leaf exhibited a MIC of 
1.2 mg/ml against Mucor rouxi, Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizopus nigricans (Karou 
et al., 2012). Furthermore, both an acetone extract of the root and the n-butanol 
fraction exhibited a MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of 1.25 and 
2.5 mg/ml respectively against Candida albicans (Ngonda et al., 2012), while the 
  30     
 
80% methanol extract of the root bark exhibited ZI of <4 mm against C. albicans 
(Runyoro et al., 2006). Moreover, the essential oils from the root bark revealed a 
MIC of 0.40 mg/ml against C. albicans (Alitonou et al., 2012). The acetone extracts 
of the root exhibited a MIC of 3.75 mg/ml against Fusarium verticillioides and 
Fusarium oxysporum while the hexane extract of the root exhibited a MFC of 3.75 
mg/ml against F. verticillioides, F. nygamai, F. proliferatum and F. graminearum 
(Samie and Mashau, 2013). Although the extracts from S. longipedunculata revealed 
potent antibacterial and antifungal activity, the mode of action remains unknown.  
 
6.3 Antiparasitic activity 
According to Fernandes et al. (2008), the water extract from the root exhibited a 
potent MIC of 0.10 mg/ml against Trichomonas vaginalis, a causative agent of the 
urogenital infection known as vaginal trichomoniasis, suggesting that the plant may 
serve as an alternative source of treatment for sexually transmitted infections in 
humans.  
 
The methanol extract from the root inhibited motility of Trypanosoma brucei brucei 
and Trypanosoma congolense in 50 and 30 min respectively at a concentration of 
0.4 mg/ml (Atawodi et al., 2003), while the petroleum ether extract from the stem 
bark inhibited motility of Trypanosoma  brucei in 55 min at a concentration of 2 
mg/ml (Atawodi, 2005). The aqueous root extract caused a gradual decrease in 
parasitemia in rats infected with T. brucei for seven days at 100 and 200 mg/kg 
(Haruna et al., 2013a). Moreover, 5, 10 and 20% fractions from the ethyl acetate 
fraction of the root revealed a LD50 of 0.14, 0.28 and 0.56 mg/kg respectively against 
Wistar rats infected with T. brucei (Haruna et al., 2013b). Water and methanol 
  31     
 
extracts of the root bark exhibited antitrypanosomal activity yielding a MIC of 56 
µg/ml against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Freiburghaus et al., 1996). The 
70% aqueous methanol extracts of the root exhibited a larvicidal effect of 75 and 
70% at 1000 µg/ml against Heligmosomoides contortus and Heligmosomoides 
polygyrus at the L3 stage (Adiele et al., 2013).  
 
6.4 Antioxidant activity 
A 70% methanol extract of the leaf exhibited an IC50 of 79.35 µg/ml against 2,2-
diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), a stable free radical (Karou et al., 2012), while 
the essential oil of the root bark exhibited an IC50 of 500 mg/L (Alitonou et al., 2012). 
The aqueous methanol extract (50%) of the root bark exhibited an IC50 of 1.351 and 
9.48 µg/ml against ABTS and DPPH respectively (Muanda et al., 2010). Although the 
extraction methods of the leaf and root bark were slightly different, these results may 
well suggest that the root bark extract quenches DPPH much better than the leaf 
extract.  
 
6.5 Antiplasmodial activity 
The dichloromethane extract of the leaves showed antiplasmodial activity with an 
IC50 of 6.9 µg/ml against Plasmodium falciparum (Bah et al., 2007), while the 
methanol extract of the root suppressed Plasmodium berghei by 82% at a dose of 
0.56 mg/kg (Haruna et al., 2013c). Furthermore, the methanol and chloroform 
extracts of the root exhibited an IC50 of ˃250 µg/ml against the chloroquinone 
resistant P. falciparum strain (Ancolio et al., 2002). Elsewhere, extracts from seeds 
of S. longipedunculata did not show any activity at 50 µg/ml against P. falciparum 
  32     
 
FCA-2 from Ethiopia (Kassa et al., 1998), suggesting that the antimalarial 
compounds may only be present in the leaves and roots. 
 
6.6 Anti-inflammatory properties. 
The 50% aqueous methanol extract showed good anti-inflammatory activity in a 
dose dependent manner by exhibiting reduction of NO production in macrophages 
stimulated with LPS/IFN-gamma yielding 51.3% inhibition at a concentration of 150 
µl (Muanda et al., 2010). The methanol extracts, petroleum ether and methanol 
fractions obtained from solvent extraction of the root bark were also investigated for 
anti-inflammatory properties using topical edema of the mouse ear model (Okoli et 
al., 2005). The petroleum ether fraction, methanol fraction and methanol extract 
revealed 65.63, 53.13 and 40.63% inhibition respectively. The extracts of these 
species exhibited good anti-inflammatory activity in different models. Interestingly, 
the water extracts, namely decoctions and infusions, are commonly applied in 
African indigenous medicine for treating various infections.  
 
6.7 Insecticidal, molluscicidal and pesticidal properties 
The methanol extracts of the root exhibited mean repellence of 60 and 80% against 
Prostephanus truncatus and Tribolium casteneum respectively at concentrations of 1 
and 2 g/ml (Eziah et al., 2013). The methanol extract of the roots revealed mean % 
repellency of 70.1 and 60.3 at 0.10 g/ml against Callosobruchus maculatus and 
Sitophilus zeamais respectively (Afful et al., 2012). Moreover, the extract revealed 
mean adult emergence of 1.0 on pupae of both C. maculatus and S. zeamais at 0.10 
g/ml. Furthermore, the extract exhibited mean adult emergence ranging from 1.0 to 
  33     
 
2.0 against both the eggs and larvae of C. maculatus and S. zeamais. In both 
studies, the extract inhibited the selected insects in a dose dependent manner. 
 
Leaf powders from S. longipedunculata collected from two different geographical 
areas, Atacora and Borgou in Benin (West Africa), exhibited percentage mortality 
rates of 18.9 and 77.2 respectively against Callosobruchus maculatus (Boeke et al., 
2004). Besides considering the collection times, climatic conditions and the age of 
the leaves, these results may well suggest that the phytochemistry of the species in 
two localities is different. The methanol extract of the root exhibited contact toxicity of 
95 and 100% against Tribolium casteneum and Prostephanus truncatus respectively 
(Eziah et al., 2013). The root powder of S. longipedunculata revealed a mean 
percentage mortality rate ranging from 25.1 to 75.4 against four storage insect pests, 
namely Rhyzopertha dominica, Sitophilus zeamais, Callosobruchus maculatus and 
Prostephanus truncatus (Belmain et al., 2001). The methanol extract of the leaf 
showed a 50% mortality rate at 1.0, 2.0 and 3 ppm, while the ethanol extracts of both 
the stem bark and leaf resulted in a 70% mortality rate against juvenile snails of 
Balinus globusus (Olofintoye, 2010). Moreover, the ethanol and methanol extracts of 
the root, leaf and stem bark exhibited high toxicity causing a 70-100% mortality rate 
at a concentration of 10.0 ppm against B. globosus. Generally, the species revealed 
high pesticidal effects against the eggs, pupae, larvae and adult species of C. 
maculatus and S. zeamais. The ethanol extracts showed good molluscidal activity 
compared to the methanol extracts.  
 
6.8 Enzyme inhibition activity 
 
  34     
 
The methanol extract of the root exhibited enzyme inhibition percentages of 6.95, 
7.73 and 5.93% against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES) and 
xanthine oxidase (XO) respectively (Bangou et al., 2011). Allopurinol exhibited 
96.38% inhibition against XO while galanthamine and ascorbic acid exhibited 50.76 
and 56.72 % against AChE and CES respectively. According to Niño et al. (2006), 
AChE is an attractive target for the rational drug design and discovery of 
mechanism-based inhibitors because of its role in the hydrolysis of the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Moreover, AChE inhibitors are most active in the 
treatment of a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s 
disease, ataxia and senile dementia. XO catalyses the oxidation of xanthine and 
hypoxanthine into uric acid, which may lead to a disease known as gout (Kong et al., 
2000). Some drugs and plant-derived extracts which serve as XO inhibitors may 
block uric acid biosynthesis, lower the plasma uric acid concentration and are used 
to treat gout (Nguyen et al., 2004). The tested S. longipedunculata extracts revealed 
negligible inhibition of AChE, CES and XO. However, future research may target 
activity of other solvent extracts and other enzyme systems.  
 
6.9 Anticonvulsant, sedative and anxiolytic properties 
The aqueous extract of the root exhibited anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and sedative 
activities against mice in a dose dependent manner (Adeyemi et al., 2010; Okomolo 
et al., 2011), suggesting that the plant extract may be used in the management of 
convulsion and psychosis.  
 
6.10 Hypoglycemic activity and histopathological effects 
 
  35     
 
The aqueous extract of the leaves lowered the blood glucose concentration from 
96.3 to 71.6 mg/dL after 8 h in rats treated with 2100 mg/kg plant extract (Onyeche 
and Kolawole, 2005). This is a high concentration and the effect may not be useful in 
practice. The 96% ethanol extract of the root bark had no hypoglycemic effect on 
mice when administered at 200 mg/kg (Keshebo et al., 2014). The 200 mg/kg 
concentration is also relatively high, limiting the extract’s practicality.  The buffer 
extract (0.5 g of the plant material dissolved in 2.5 ml buffer at room temperature for 
20 min) from the root had some antidiabetic activity through exhibiting 20 to 45% 
inhibition of α-amylase (Funke and Melzig, 2006). This inhibition is relatively low so 
probably does not justify further research although other mechanisms of action may 
be applicable. No information was found on the bioavailability or pharmacokinetic 
parameters of the extract. 
 
The aqueous root extracts reportedly affect the tissue morphology of rats, resulting in 
irreversible cellular injury affecting the epithelial parenchyma and endothelial cells 
when administered at 2 mg/kg using intra-peritoneal injection for 14 consecutive 
days (Dapar et al, 2007). The extract histopathologically resulted in acute tubular 
necrosis in the kidneys, diffused alveolar and alveolar capillary damage in the lungs 
and severe ballooning degeneration with early steatohepatitis in some foci of the 
liver. It is difficult to conclude the effect of S. longipedunculata on various tissues due 
to the lack of information reported.  
 
7. Conclusions 
It is evident that S. longipedunculata is a very important medicinal plant used 
extensively for various purposes within African traditional culture. Studies on the 
  36     
 
toxicology, both in vivo and in vitro revealed that various extracts, particularly the 
aqueous root bark, may be toxic especially at high concentrations. This finding is 
concerning as some people from poor communities rely heavily on plants sold by 
traders without accurate prescriptions or directions for use. The extracts have been 
investigated for toxicity against mice and rats, brine shrimps, Hela cells, human 
pancreatic cancer cells and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. There is a need to 
investigate the cytotoxicity of these extracts against normal human cell lines. The 
histopathological and hypoglycemic effects of the species, as well as many other 
aspects, also need to be further explored. 
 
Phytochemically, salicylic acid, a variety of xanthones and esters form an integral 
part of this plant. These phytochemicals may well explain the antimicrobial, 
anthelmintic, antimalarial and other biological activities of this plant as highlighted in 
the current paper. However, these phytochemicals were reported from the root 
extract and the removal of the roots may be detrimental to plant life. The 
conservation status of this plant is also of great concern because the roots are 
mostly used for medicinal purposes and are traded between communities and 
neighbouring countries.  
 
Interestingly, the use of the plant species has been validated for treatment of 
malaria, erectile dysfunction, pain, sexually transmitted infections and other 
infections. Various extracts from the species exhibited anthelmintic, antioxidant, 
molluscicidal, pesticidal, various enzyme inhibitory and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Extracts from S. longipedunculata revealed potent antimicrobial activity against 
Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis, validating to an extent the use of the 
  37     
 
plant species in the treatment of sexually transmitted infections. However there is a 
need to explore the biological activity of various extracts from the species against 
microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Klebsiella granulomatis, 
Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus spp. and Mycoplasma genitalium as the most 
common causative agents of gonorrhoea, bacterial vaginitis, donovanosis and other 
urogenital infections. There is also a need to investigate the biological activity of the 
other compounds occurring in the plant extracts. Moreover, the anti-diabetic, 
hypoglycemic and histopathologic effects of the species also need to be explored as 
there are few reports in the literature regarding these aspects.
