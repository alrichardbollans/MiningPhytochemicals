ABSTRACT 
Papaver somniferum commonly known as Khashkhash /Afyon, belongs to family Papaveraceae. It is one of those traditional plants, 
which have a long history of usage as medicine. The opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) produces some of the most widely used 
medicinal alkaloids like morphine, codeine, thebain and porphyroxine which are the most important component of this plant. Apart 
from these alkaloids, opium poppy produces approximately eighty alkaloids belonging to various tetrahydrobenzyl 
isoquinolinederived classes. It has been known for over a century that morphinan alkaloids accumulate in the latex of opium poppy. 
According to Unani literature, it possesses most important theurapeutic values as modern literature and research studies also prove 
its therapeutical importance. It is used as analgesic, narcotic, sedative, stimulant as well as nutritive, etc. It is also useful in headache, 
cough, insomnia, cardiac asthma, and biliary colic. In this paper we have provide a review on habitate, pharmacological actions, 
phytochemical with special refrence to Unani Medicine. In this review, an attempt is made to explore the complete information of 
Papaver somniferum including its  phytochemistry and pharmacology. 
Keywords: Khashkhash, Biliary colic, Alkaloid, phytochemistry.

INTRODUCTION 
Over a period of times, the researchers have become 
more interested in finding out the potential of various 
drugs to treat diseases and to maintain the general health 
1
. Herbal medicines are the unique gift of the nature as 
complementary to all the life in the world. Herbs are 
being use as medicine since the inception of life in the 
universe. Herbal drugs are derived from plants as whole 
or its part i.e. roots, stem, bark, leave, flower, fruit and 
seeds for the healing purposes 
2
. Despite the emergence 
of new chemical drugs in contemporary medicine, the 
application of herbal remedies has not yet been declined. 
Recently, interest in traditional medicine was revived by 
the WHO recommendations for the development of 
native knowledge and the use of alternative national 
medicine 
3
. During the recent decades, chemical side 
effects have been identified and measures have been 
taken to overcome this problem. Thus, people again 
turned to natural products, especially in pharmaceutical 
industry. In recent years, medicine as well as health 
aspects are receiving special attention from the general 
public 
4
. According to World Health Organization 
(WHO) reports that as many as 80% of the world’s 
people depend on traditional medicine for their primary 
health care needs 
5
. Although the use of medicinal herbs

ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                            [111]                                                                             CODEN (USA): JDDTAO 
is not the only therapeutic method in traditional 
medicine, it is the basis of medical treatments 
6
. A large 
number of herbal drugs are mentioned in Unany System 
of Medicine, one of them is Khashkash/Afyon (Papaver 
somniferum), belongs to family Papaveraceae. It is one 
of those traditional plants, which have a long history of 
usage as medicine. The word “opium” is of Greek 
(Unani) origin which is derived from “opos” (juice) and 
“opion” (poppy juice). Opium mostly postulated to 
came into Greece from Asia Minor and the ancient 
Greeks associated various divinities with opium, 
including Hypnos (sleep), Morpheus (dreams), Nyx 
(night) and Thanatos (the twin brother of Hypnos) 
(death). Opium is frequently mentioned in classical 
Unani literarure for its pain-relieving and sleep inducing 
action 
7
. The opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) 
produces some of the most widely used medicinal 
alkaloids like morphine, codeine, thebain and 
porphyroxine which are the most important component 
of this plant. Morphine was the first plant alkaloid ever 
isolated in 1806 by a 22 year old German pharmacist, 
Friederich Wilhelm Adam Serturner. Morphine was 
extracted from the dried milky exudates, obtained from 
the capsule of Papaver somniferum. In 1839 the British 
successfully waged the Opium War with China to 
preserve its profitable opium trade. The surgeon 
William Halstead successfully "treated" a debilitative 
addiction to cocaine by switching to morphine 
8
. 
According to Unani literature, it is used alone or in 
combination with other medicine as compound 
formulation like Itrifal Muqawwi Dimagh, Sharbat 
khashkhash, and khamir-e-khashkhash.etc

MORPHOLOGY 
Macroscopic:  
The Seeds of Papaver somniferum Linn are dried, white, 
grey or grayish black in colour, sub-reniform and about 
1.25 mm long. The surface is covered with polygonal 
reticulations about nine in length and five in width of 
seed, the hilum and micropyle are situated in a 
depression near one end. The embryo is curved and 
embedded in endosperm. Sweetish or oily in taste and 
unpleasant odour 
9,13
.  
 Microscopic:  
Sectional view of seed coat showed a single layer of 
epidermis which contains somewhat elongated, thick 
walled parenchymatous cells with thick cuticle on outer 
side. Below which the region is composed of polygonal 
to oval, thin walled parenchymatous cells. The 
epidermis of cotyledons is usually consisted of 
rectangular to oval, slightly thick walled parechymatous 
cells which possess yellowish brown contents. Rest of 
the part is made up of thin walled, hexagonal to 
polygonal parenchymatous cells, containing starch 
grains. The starch grains are oval to round in shape.  
The sectional view of radical showed the epidermis 
composed of squarish parenchymatous cells. Aleurone 
grains are present in cortical region which consisted of 
many layers of thin walled, polygonal to oval 
parenchymatous cells

CONCLUSION 
From the time immemorial, it has been used for variety 
of ailments. Research in medicinal plants has gained a 
renewed focus recently. The discovery of natural 
alkaloids with promising biological activities have been 
demonstrated the significance of this plant drug. This 
review enriches our knowledge regarding the 
phytochemical as well as therapeutic values and 
pharmacological aspect used in Unani System of 
Medicine. Though Papaver somniferum has various 
medicinal applications, but it is need of hour to explore 
the more medicinal values at molecular level with the 
help of biotechnological tools and techniques. Further 
studies should be conducted to elucidate its mechanism 
of action in different diseases.
