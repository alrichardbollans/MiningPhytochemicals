Indian J. Pharm. Biol. Res. 2021; 9(2):1-6ISSN: 2320-9267Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biological Research (IJPBR)Journal homepage: www.ijpbr.inINTRODUCTION Medicinal plants play an important role in our natural wealth. They serve as an important therapeutic agent and valuable raw material for manufacturing numerous traditional medicines and acts as the lead for modern medicines. The history of medicinal plants uses for treating disease and ailments is probably dated back to human civilization. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that about three-quarters of the world’s population currently uses herbs or other forms of traditional medicines to treat illness. Even in the USA, the use of plants and phytomedicines has increased dramatically.[1] The large diversity of medicinal plant species is a huge source of potentially active phytochemicals with novel structures. Approximately 119 pure chemical substances isolated from higher plants are used in medicine worldwide.[2] Spathodeacampanulata P. Beauvais is one of the medicinally important perennial plants commonly used as folkloric medicine in Nigeria. The species Spathodeacampanulata belong to the family Bignoniaceae and is native to Africa. It is often used in gardening in tropical and subtropical areas, including South America.[3] The flowers are used as diuretic and anti-inflammatory, while the leaves are against kidney diseases, urethra inflammations and as an antidote against animal poisons.[4] Several phytochemical studies were performed with different parts of Spathodeacampanulata , including stem barks, leaves, flowers, and fruits. The leaves contain spathodol, caffeic acid, other phenolic acids, and flavonoids, while fruits contain polyphenols, tannins, saponins and glycosides.[5] The plant leaves are reported ABSTRACTSpathodeacampanulata (S.campanulata) belongs to the family Bignoniaceae, commonly known as the Fountain tree, African tulip tree, Flame-of-the forest. S.campanulata parts of the plant such as flowers, leaves, stem, bark, and roots are used for anti-malaria, healing of wound, diureticanalgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in folk medicine. The S.campanulata is known to possess various therapeutic properties have been reported for possessing anti-inflammatory, analgesic, cytotoxic, anti-diabetic, and anticonvulsant activity. Phytochemical study shows the presence of various secondary metabolites like alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, glycosides, and sterols. This review aims to provide detailed information regarding geographical distribution, phytochemicals, and pharmacological properties of the S.campanulata.Keywords: Anti-cancer, Flavonoids, S.campanulata.Indian J.

The opposite imparipinnate leaves are exstipulate. Each leaf consists of 5-7 pairs of opposite leaflets and a terminal one. The leaflets are oblong-elliptic, about 1 cm long and 0.5 cm broad, entire, broadly acuminate, unequal at the base, dark green on top, and light green on the underside; there are glandular swellings at the base of the lamina (usually a pair); the midrib and nerves are yellow, raised and very slightly pubescent; the venation is reticulate; the short, thick petiole is about 0.7 cm long; there are conspicuous lenticels on the rachis; rachis base is swollen. Flowers large, red, hermaphrodite, orange inside; calyx green, about 1 cm long and split on the posterior side, ribbed and tomentellous; petals 5, each about 1.5 cm long; stamens 4 with orange filaments; style extruding with a 2-lipped stigma; flower buds curved and contain a red sap. A yellow-flowered variety has been reported. Fruit upstanding, dark brown, cigar-shaped, woody pod, 15-25 cm long and split on the ground into 2 boat-shaped valves, releasing many flat-winged seeds; 1-4 pods usually develop from 1 flower cluster; seeds thin, flat, and surrounded by a filmy wing.The generic name comes from the Greek word ‘spathe’ (blade), from the shape of the corolla. The specific name means about a Campanula, a name coined in 1542 by Fuchs for the type of corolla with a broad rounded base and a gradually expanded tube corresponding to the sound bow of a church bell.[7]BiologyLarge, orange to scarlet, funnel-shaped hermaphrodite flowers are produced from rust-colored, hairy buds in the bunches at the ends of branches. The flowers open from the outside of the bunch towards the center. S.campanulata may begin flowering as young as 3 or 4 years of age, with open-grown trees flowering when they are about 5 m tall; in some Figure 2: Different parts of S. campanulataFigure 1: Spathodea campanulataAfrah Fatima et al. / Indian J. Pharm. Biol. Res., 2021; 9 (2):1-6Review Article 3tough environments, flowering is delayed until the trees are much larger. Flowering stretches over a 5 or 6-month period, and the pods mature and begin releasing their seeds about 5 months after flowering. The tree reproduces aggressively, so it is frequently a nuisance in pastures and fields with perennial crops. The winged seeds are wind-dispersed.[7]EcologyS. campanulata grows naturally in Africa in secondary forests in the high forest zone and in deciduous, transition, and savannah forests. It colonizes even heavily eroded sites, though form and growth rate suffer considerably on difficult sites. It is native to tropical Africa. Introduced and cultivated in India (Bangalore, Hassan, Mysore).[7]Growth and DevelopmentGrowth of the bole may be up to 5 cm/year in diameter. Flowering may start 2–3 years after planting. The flowers are individually short-lived but carried in succession over long periods. Under favorable conditions, African tulip trees may flower throughout the year. In areas with a pronounced dry season (e.g., Kenya) or cold season (e.g., southern United States, Spain) the trees are deciduous and have a marked peak in flowering. High temperatures during flowering interfere with pollen development and fertilization. The seeds are wind-dispersed. Coppice growth is reported to be excellent; trees will coppice up to at least pole size.[8]Propagation and PlantingPropagation is mostly by seed. Seeds do not require treatment; they are recalcitrant, and their viability is short. One kg contains about 125,000 seeds. Cuttings can also be used for propagation, with larger diameter cuttings (up to 10 cm) giving the best results. Saddle and side grafting are sometimes used to multiply desirable ornamental forms, such as those as yellow flowers, with higher success rates for side grafting (75% vs. 25%). However, saddle-grafted plants have better growth. Root suckers can also be used for propagation.[8]UsesThe African tulip tree is planted as an ornamental, wayside tree and shade tree. It is used for soil improvement, re-afforestation, erosion control and land rehabilitation, and as a live fence. Its dense crown does not allow intercropping, but its leaves make it useful. It has been used as a shade tree in coffee plantations. In teak plantations, African tulip trees can attract initial populations of teak defoliator (Hyblaeapuera which can then be easily destroyed. In West Africa, wood is used for carving but considered inferior for other purposes. In Ethiopia, it is used as firewood and to produce charcoal. Plywood seems the only widespread commercial use for timber, traded as African tulip (En) or tulipier (Fr); African tulip tree is grown as a plantation crop for this purpose in the Philippines. The seeds are eaten in many parts of Africa. The flower buds contain a reddish sap, and are used as water pistols by children.[8]Medicinal UsesIt is used in African traditional medicine. The stem, bark and leaf are used in treatment for dyspepsia and peptic ulcer. The leaf, root, bark and fruit are used for arthritis and fractures. The stem bark is used for toothache and stomache. Root bark seed is used for stomach ulcers.S. campanulata has many medicinal uses both where it is native and introduced. Extracts of bark, leaves, and flowers are used to treat malaria, HIV, diabetes mellitus edema, dysentery, constipation, gastrointestinal disorders, ulcers, skin diseases, wounds, fever, urethral inflammation, liver complaints, and liver poison antidote. It may be effective as malaria prophylactic and in the control of Aedesmosquitoes. Pulverised bark is used in skin diseases, decoction given in dysentery, renal and gastrointestinal troubles. Infusion of leaves used in urethral inflammation.The bark has laxative and antiseptic properties, and the seeds, flowers, and roots are used as medicine. The bark is chewed and sprayed over swollen cheeks. The bark may also be boiled in water used for bathing newly born babies to heal body rashes.[9]Phytochemical ConstituentsPreliminary phytochemical screening of Spathodeacam-panulata P. Beauvais revealed the presence of alkaloids, reducing sugars, carbohydrates, flavones, glycosides, and phenolic compounds.[10] Several compounds have been iso-Table 1: Morphological characteristics of S.campanulataAfrah Fatima et al. / Indian J. Pharm. Biol. Res., 2021; 9 (2):1-6Review Article 4lated from different parts of the Spathodeacampanulata P. beauv (Table 2).Pharmacological PropertiesAnti-solar ActivityMethanolic extract of flowers of S. campanulata as antisolar activity. The results obtained showed the extract’s ability to absorb UV radiation and hence proved its UV production ability. This ability may be due to the presence of flavonoids.[19]The Schizontocidal and Anti-malarial ActivityEffects of extracts of S. campanulata on Plasmodium bergheiin mice have been investigated. Schizontocidal activity of the plant in blood was determined on both the early and established infections. The repository action of the plant was also investigated. The alcoholic extract of the leaves of the plant demonstrated antiplasmodial activity. The plant extract was more effective in treating the early infection than the established ones. This report provides scientific data for the use of the aqueous-alcoholic decoction of the leaves of S. campanulata for the treatment of malaria.[20]Antifungal ActivityThe phenolic derivatives could play an important role in root tissues in defensive mechanism against fungi and other organisms in tropical soil.[21]Antibacterial ActivitySpathoside, a new cerebroside, was isolated from the stem bark of Spathodeacampanulata, besides known compounds (n-alkanes, linear aliphatic alcohols, sitosterol and their esters, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, oleanolic acid, pomolic acid, p- hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylethanol esters). The structures of the isolated compounds were established by spectroscopic studies. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds against a wide range of microorganisms was examined. They significantly inhibited the growth of some gram-positive and -negative bacteria.[22]Antimicrobial Activity (Wound Healing Activity)The antibacterial activity of the aqueous, ethanol, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of sundried stem bark of SpathodeacampanulataP. Beauv. (Bignoniaceae) was investigated by testing the extracts against B. subtilis, E. coli, P. aeruginosaandS. aureus. The methanol extract’s minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against the four bacteria strains and C. albicansusingthe broth dilution method. Four topical products were prepared by incorporating the methanol extract of S. campanulate (20 % w/w) into aqueous cream, soft paraffin, emulsifying ointment, and simple ointment bases and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial efficacy. The effect of storage time on the activity of the methanol extract of S. campanulataandS.campanulataextract incorporated in an aqueous cream base was also investigated. The methanol and ethanol extracts showed good activity, while the aqueous and petroleum ether extracts exhibited little activity. The methanol extract showed the best antibacterial action.[23]Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory ActivityThe analgesic and anti-inflammatory potentials of the ethanol leaf extract of Spathodeacampanulata, a Nigerian traditional medicinal plant was studied using cold, thermal, and chemical-induced pain models and carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in rats.

Pharm. Biol. Res., 2021; 9 (2):1-6Review Article 5campanulate possesses both peripheral and central analgesic properties. The leaf extract of Spathodeacampanulatahas both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and could be beneficial in alleviating painful inflammatory conditions.[24]Healing of BurnsThe methanolic extract of the barks of S.campanulatahas burn healing effectiveness.[25]Hypoglycemic and anti-HIV ActivityS. campanulatastem bark decoction (SCD) has shown hypoglycemic activity in mice. It was separated by column chromatography into different fractions, which were evaluated for their hypoglycemic, anti-complement and anti-HIV activities. The most polar fraction exerted by far the most prominent effect in different biological models.[26]Anti-oxidant ActivityThe extracts have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties due to flavonoids, triterpenoids, diterpenoids, and caffeic acid derivatives from S. campanulate.[27]Antidiarrheal ActivityAlcoholic and aqueous extracts of stem bark of S. campanulatahas anti diarrheal activity.[28]Cytotoxic ActivityVictor et al. investigated the cytotoxic activity of the methanolic extract of Spathodeacampanulata P. beauv. The methanolic extract was obtained by soaking the air-dried material in methanol for 48 h at room temperature activity and studied for cytotoxic activity by Resazurin Reduction assay against sensitive leukemia CCRF-CRM cell lines. The methanolic extract displayed IC50 value below 80μg/mL.[29]Anti-cataract ActivityAdio et al. evaluated the anti-cataract activity of fresh flower bud exudates of Spathodeacampanulata P. beauv against cataract genesis using rat lenses. Cataractogenesis was evaluated by determining the levels of anti-oxidant parameters such as total protein, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were evaluated in the lens homogenates. Exudates significantly decrease the levels of glutathione and total protein, reduction in superoxide dismutase and Catalase activities, and an increase in malondialdehyde content were observed in cataractous lenses compared with those of the latter the normal control. Flower bud exudates of Spathodeacampanulata P. beauv displayed a dose-related anti-cataract activity.[30]REFERENCES1. Parul T, Aditi S.
