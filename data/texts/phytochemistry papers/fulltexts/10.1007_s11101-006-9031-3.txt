Abstract Metabolomics is defined as both the quali-
tative and quantitative analysis of all metabolites in an
organism unraveling correlation with other OMICs
data. Many of the technologies used in metabolomics
have method-specific advantages and drawbacks in
terms of diversity of metabolites detected, sensitivity, or
resolution. In this paper, the potential of NMR spec-
trometry applied to metabolomics is reviewed using
examples of Nicotiana tabacum and Catharanthus roseus

Introduction
In the past years, several genomes have been com-
pletely sequenced and the genomes of more organisms
are being sequenced. The number of fully sequenced
organisms will grow exponentially. This will open novel
possibilities of studying the functions of the genes in
these organisms. Functional genomics requires a thor-
ough definition of the phenotype, to be able to deter-
mine what changes result from up- or down-regulation
of genes. A phenotype can be defined by morphologi-
cal characteristics, by physiological measurements, as
well as by biochemical (transcriptomics or proteomics)
and chemical (metabolomics) analysis. In recent years,
more and more attention is being paid to the chemical
characterization of the phenotype. Chemical charac-
terization can be done on the level of macromolecules
(e.g., proteomics and characterization of polysaccha-
rides and lignins) or low molecular weight compounds
(the metabolome). The metabolome consists of two
types of compounds, the primary metabolites and the
secondary metabolites. The primary metabolites are
compounds involved in the basic functions of the living
cell, such as respiration and biosynthesis of the amino
acids and other compounds needed for a living cell.
Basically all organisms share the same type of primary
metabolites, though per class of organisms there may
be large differences in the biosynthetic pathways
present, e.g., mammalians lack amino acid biosynthe-
sis, as they rely on external sources for their needs. The
secondary metabolites are species specific, they play a
role in the interaction of a cell with its environment,
which can be other cells in the organism or external
organisms, e.g., in case of plants to attract pollinators,
or to defense itself against pests and diseases. So pri-
mary metabolites in plants are important for the
growth and agricultural yields, whereas the secondary
metabolites are, e.g., concerned with flavor and color
of our food and with the resistance of plants against
pests and diseases.
Obviously in studying functions of genes metabolo-
mics will be an important tool. Metabolomics is
generally defined as both the qualitative and quanti-
tative analysis of all metabolites in an organism. In
analyzing a metabolome both the primary and
secondary metabolites will be detected. Plants share
the primary metabolites, therefore methods that can
easily identify and quantify the primary metabolites
with high reproducibility are required. One or more
methods are required that in all labs and at any time
will give the same results, which thus enables a public

database which can be used in the same way as the
databases for protein and gene sequences. Also for the
secondary metabolites such a database is needed,
though in that case the occurrence of most compounds
is restricted to one or a few species only. The repro-
ducibility is also required for studying the effect of any
external condition on the plant metabolome, as one
needs to know the biological variation. That requires
large numbers of analyses to determine the meta-
bolomic changes as function of daily, seasonal, and
developmental variation. The results should function
as the control samples for all future analyses.
Thus, reproducibility is the most important criteria
for developing a metabolomics technology platform.
The other criteria concern the ease of quantitation and
identification, the number of metabolites that can be
measured, and the time needed for an analysis,
including the sample preparation. Obviously a high-
throughput methodology is preferred, for which
robotization is important. Based on the underlying
principle, the methods which one may consider for a
metabolomic platform can be grouped as follows:
- chromatographic methods (liquid chromatography,
gas chromatography (GC), capillary electrophore-
sis, thin layer chromatography);
- mass spectrometry (MS);
- nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.
A combination of chromatography and one or both
of the other two methods also is an option. In Table 1,
the various weak and strong points of these methods
are summarized. Concerning the mentioned criteria,
chromatographic methods have a major problem in
reproducibility. Although the intra- and inter-day
variability may be reasonable, there is always a
problem of getting the same separation in another lab
due to small changes in external conditions, chemicals,
or solvents. Moreover, due to aging, column perfor-
mance changes through time. Last but not least,
commercial companies always come with improved
columns, which usually also means an altered selec-
tivity of the system. A simple search in the literature
for the separation of, e.g., tropane alkaloids shows that
every year a number of new ‘‘improved’’ separation
systems is described for these alkaloids. This is a poor
basis for a long-term reproducible database of results
of such an analysis. MS also has a problem of repro-
ducibility, mainly because in MS analysis the com-
pounds have to be ionized before measuring. There
exist many different types of mass spectrometers with
different ways to ionize the molecules, making com-
parison difficult. Besides the variation of the hardware
and the conditions chosen, also a considerable matrix
effect exists for the efficiency of the ionization, which
means that a compound in different extracts may give
different quantitative results.
NMR spectrometry is a physical measurement of the
resonances of magnetic nuclei, such as 1H, 13C, or 15N
in a strong magnetic field. Each compound has a highly
specific spectrum. The only variables are the solvent
used and the magnetic field strength. The solvent is
easy to standardize. The field strength is not a problem
with 13C NMR and even in case of 1H NMR it can be
overcome (see below). The high reproducibility makes
that NMR among the three methods mentioned is the
most suited for a public domain metabolomics data-
base that may serve for many years to come.
Concerning the criteria of quantitation, the chro-
matographic methods have shown through the years
to be very suitable for quantitative analysis. However,
they always require calibration curves for the com-
pounds that are quantified, as each compound will
give a different detector response. Only in GC in
combination with a flame ionization detector (FID)
one may compare peak intensities with each other,
and thus make an estimation of the absolute quanti-
ties of all compounds detected. UV-detection in
HPLC, and MS in HPLC and GC will show totally
different sensitivities for each compound, some even
not being detected at all. For complex samples with a
number of compounds, it is not feasible to make
calibration curves for all compounds. That means only
a relative comparison for each compound in different
analyses is possible, but no absolute quantitation can
be done, i.e., one cannot compare the amounts pres-
ent of different compounds. This is a major disad-
vantage, e.g., one cannot make any conclusion about
the conversion of one compound into another in case

of a decrease of one compound and an increase in
another related compound, i.e., conclusions about
stoichiometry cannot be drawn from the data. For
qualitative analysis the hyphenated chromatographic
methods (HPLC with diode array detector, -MS, and/
or NMR, GC–MS) are the most powerful as they
offer both retention behavior and physical character-
istics as a tool for identification. MS allows the
determination of the molecular weight, and in case of
high resolution also of the elemental composition, but
this is not always sufficient to determine the structure.
Tandem MS might be of help to identify in such case
the compound through its fragmentation pattern, but
in case of novel compounds further spectral data are
required. The performance for NMR can be improved
by using two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods (see
below), which even may enable structure elucidation
of novel compounds in a mixture. In fact 13C NMR
spectra were already used in the early 1980s for fin-
gerprinting essential oils (Forma´cˇek and Kubeczka
1982). We described the use of 1H NMR spectra for
the fingerprinting of plant cell cultures (Schripsema
and Verpoorte 1991). It has been used ever since for
the analysis of sugars in cell cultures and media (e.g.,
Kraemer et al. 1999, 2002; Schripsema and Verpoorte
1991). Also other compounds have been analyzed in
plant extracts by means of NMR, e.g., pyrrolizidine
alkaloids (Pieters et al. 1989) and hop bitter agents
(Hoek et al. 2001). With the increasing field strength
of the NMR-magnets and the improved resolution
the application of NMR for metabolomics became
feasible.
Here we will first discuss the general approach to
metabolomics and the sample preparation methods
and show some examples of the use of NMR-meta-
bolomics in phytochemical studies. The weak points
and possible solutions will be discussed.
Sample preparation
In metabolomics studies there are three phases. The first
one is a qualitative phase in which as many as possible of
the signals observed in the NMR are assigned to com-
pounds. After this phase it is first necessary to determine
the biological variation for the system studied, that
means measuring a large number of samples, e.g., young
and old leaves, different times of the day, and different
stages of development of the plant. The last step is to
compare the model system under different experimental
conditions or compare, e.g., diseased or transgenic
plants with the normal wild type plant. An important
aspect is of course the extraction method. Plants contain
a wide variety of compounds with totally different
polarities. No single method is able to detect all
metabolites in a single operation. To extract as many as
possible we developed some years ago a two-phase
extraction method in which chloroform–methanol–
water (2:1:1) was used. This procedure extracts both
polar and polar compounds in the same operation. This
method gives good results, but is quite elaborate.
Therefore, a series of single solvents were tested for the
extraction of the metabolites from Arabidopsis
(unpublished data, Fig. 1). By multivariate analysis, the
spectra were compared in order to see which solvent
covered the widest range of compounds. Methanol–
water (1:1) came out as the best one in terms of the
diversity (Choi et al. 2006; Hendrawati et al. 2006;

Liang et al. 2006a, b; Widarto et al. 2006). By using these
solvents in deuterated form, extracts can be measured
directly after extraction, without any need of evapora-
tion and reconstitution of the extract. To avoid shifts due
to differences of pH (Schripsema et al. 1986) a buffered
solvent (KH2PO4) is used (pH 6.0).
Transgenic tobacco plants overexpression microbial
genes for salicylate biosynthesis
We have overexpressed the microbial genes encoding
the isochorismate pathway leading to salicylate (SA).
The genes, isochorismate synthase from Escherichia
coli, and isochorismate lyase from Pseudomonas fluo-
rescens, result in the constitutive production of SA in
tobacco plants. These plants have an increased resis-
tance against viral and fungal infection (Verberne et al.
2000). This raised the question if any secondary metab-
olites pathways were altered, either due to the SA that is
involved as signal compound in the systemic acquired
resistance (SAR), or due to channeling of chorismate
away from the other important chorismate pathways
branches, leading among others to phenylalanine (and
from there to all phenylpropanoids) and tryptophan. In a
series of papers, various targeted approaches have been
described, which led to the conclusion that terpenoids

(by HPLC-analysis, Nugroho et al. 2002b) were not
effected, whereas flavonoids (by HPLC-analysis,
Nugroho et al. 2002c) showed lower levels, similar
conclusions were drawn from a non-targeted approach
using centrifugal partitioning chromatography to
prefractionate the extract followed by LC–MS to
analyze the fractions (Halim et al. 2003). This was a
major effort as each of the different groups of
compounds required the validation of a suited method.
The next step was to use this model system for an
NMR-based metabolomics approach, to learn how this
approach compared with the elaborate targeted
approach.
The first step was the qualitative analysis. A
number of compounds could easily be identified. To
facilitate the identification we started to build a
database with NMR spectra of common plant
metabolites. This database contains now more than
300 compounds, and more than 600 spectra (both 1D
and 2D spectra). Some of the very common diag-
nostics signals are summarized in Table 2. They
represent, e.g., phenolics, the anomeric protons of
sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. In each area
of the NMR, one may look for specific groups of
compounds (Fig. 2).
Using this method extensive studies have been made
of the metabolomes of the tobacco plants (Choi et al.
2004a, 2006). We used the two-phase or deuterated
solvent extraction method, and measured the NMR
spectra. For analyzing the large data set of NMR
spectra, multivariate analysis (using SIMCA-P, Umet-
rics, Umea˚, Sweden) was used. From the results we
were able to clearly distinguish these in wild type and
transgenic plants. To introduce the NMR spectra into
the biostatistics program, they have to be processed
into digital quantifiable data. This is done by dividing
the spectra into buckets (or bins) of 8 or 16 Hz, peak
height in each bucket is integrated and introduced into
a text file used for further statistical analysis. This
processing can be done by the NMR-software (e.g.,
AMIX, Bruker Biospin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Ger-
many). For robustness of the bucketing high repro-
ducibility of chemical shift is required. By using a
buffered NMR-solvent, the reproducible chemical shift
can be obtained. However, there are still problem with
organic acids such as citric, citramalic, isocitric, malic,
and succinic acid. The chemical shift of these signals
may vary considerably depending on pH of the solu-
tion. In order to solve the problem the region in which
they occur can be bucketed by larger size (e.g., 40 Hz).
However, one should always be aware of the risk that a
compound may show changes in its NMR spectra, e.g.,
due to complexity of the mixture, or due to concen-
tration effects (Rhee et al. 2004). Table 3 shows the
example of the variation of chemical shifts of citric acid
and malic acid in different concentration.
The signals responsible for the separation found in the
score plot of principle component analysis (PCA) were
identified from the loading plot (Fig. 3). Assigning these
signals to various known tobacco constituents resulted in
the conclusion that the transgenic plants had lower levels
of flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, and sugars, and higher
levels of malic acid and alanine (Choi et al. 2004a). The
alkaloid and terpenoid levels were not changed. Similar
conclusions as for the targeted approach (see above), but
as extra information the increased levels of sugars and
alanine were observed in this approach. This nicely
showed the great potential of studying metabolic chan-
ges in a single NMR-analysis.

types of phytoplasmas (Choi et al. 2004b). Again a
clear separation could be obtained for the plants,
analysis of the markers for the differences led to the
conclusions as shown in Fig. 4. Also, in this case, the
macroscopic view on the metabolome via the NMR-
analysis clearly showed major changes in the infected
plants. In this case, a considerable effort was made to
identify a number of compounds using 2D NMR
spectrometry, this among others allowed the identifi-
cation of the iridoids (see Fig. 5).
Brassicaceae NMR-based metabolomics
From the results with the tobacco and C. roseus it be-
came clear that biostatistical software (e.g., SIMCA-P)
especially developed for metabolomics-like applica-
tions might be an advantage. Also, we learned that in
general the two-phase extraction system was quite
elaborate and thus not the preferred one for a high-
throughput systems. Moreover, the chloroform phase
mostly only showed strong signals due to fatty acids,
which can be quantified as group, but individual acids
cannot be observed in the 1D NMR spectra. On the
other hand, the methanol–water phase gave an excel-
lent overview of the plant’s metabolome, and partic-
ularly on a broad range of secondary metabolites. A
direct extraction with deuterated methanol–water sol-
vent thus seems to be most suited (unpublished data).
For the identification of compounds further 2D NMR
methods were explored to identify compounds in the
crude extracts. Also, the problem of comparing spectra

obtained at different field strength needed to be
solved. These matters were addressed in a series
of experiments with tobacco, Brassica rapa and
Arabidopsis thaliana.
One of the major problems of NMR-metabolomics
is the overlap of many signals, particularly in some
crowded regions. The use of 2D NMR spectrometry
can improve this considerably. In 2D J-resolved spec-
tra, the second dimension gives for each signal the
coupling constant (Fig. 6a, Liang et al. 2006a). In this
way, the congestion is to a great extend solved.
Moreover, the coupling constant is an excellent diag-
nostic tool for the classification of signals as belonging
to a certain class of compounds (e.g., cinnamic acid
derivatives, Fig. 6a) (Liang et al. 2006a). Moreover, by
projecting the signals of 2D J-resolved spectra on the
F2 axis (the chemical shift), each signal is reduced to a
singlet, i.e., each proton is now observed as a singlet
(Fig. 7). The spectra are comparable in appearance to
13C NMR spectra. This simplifies the spectra enor-
mously, as well as the identification of known com-
pounds as the overlap of signals is much less. The most
important aspect of these projected 2D J-resolved
spectra is that all secondary effects are eliminated,
consequently the spectra are independent of the field
strength (Choi et al. 2006). This makes them to excel-
lent candidates for storage in a large database for long-
term use in metabolomics. The disadvantage of these
spectra is that because of the projection the intensity of
the signals of the different protons cannot be compared
anymore. For absolute quantitation, the intensities of
the different peaks in the second dimension need to be
added.
For the identification of compounds 2D NMR
spectrometry methods are of great value. Signals can
be identified as well as their coupling with other pro-
tons or carbons. Figure 6 shows part of the spectrum of
B. rapa in which from the 2D J-resolved spectrum it
was clear that the congested signals at d 6.3–6.5 were
due to cinnamic acid derivatives as they all have pro-
tons with a large coupling constant (16 Hz, Liang et al.
2006a). A single separation step of the extract was
made to have an enriched phenolic compound fraction,
and thus reduce the NMR time needed to run the
various 2D NMR spectra. Further 2D NMR spectra
were used to elucidate their structures. From the
COSY and HMBC spectra, it can be learned that
malic acid moiety attaches to carboxylic group of

anoids of B. rapa leaves in the range of d 6.25–6.50 (a); d 5.32–

phenylpropanoids. The presence of the attached H-2 of
malic acid was confirmed by 2D J-resolved spectra
(Fig. 6b). From the various 2D NMR experiments, a
whole series of cinnamic acid derivatives was identified
as shown in Fig. 8, both cis- and trans-isomers were
found (Liang et al. 2006a). Whether the cis-derivatives
are artifacts or already formed in the plant remains to
be determined.
Using the NMR-based metabolomics approach we
studied the effects of a methyl jasmonate treatment of
B. rapa plants (Liang et al. 2006b). The score plot of
the PCA (Fig. 9) shows a clear separation between the
treated and non-treated plants. From the loading plot,
it can be concluded that the phenylpropanoids dis-
cussed above increased in the treated plants, also an
indole glucosinolate such as neoglucobrassicin and in-
dole acetic acid increased in the treated plants.
Virus infected tobacco
The various tools we developed since our first tobacco
experiments were applied on a study of tobacco mosaic
virus (TMV) infected tobacco plants. This system has
been studied extensively on the level of genes and
proteins to clarify the SAR in plants. As already dis-
cussed above SA does play an important role in SAR.
Interestingly very little work has been done on the role
of secondary metabolism in SAR, as still the function
of several of the pathogen-related proteins is unknown,
they might play a role in secondary metabolism. We
thus applied our NMR-metabolomics platform tech-
nology on this system (Choi et al. 2006). In Fig. 10, the
PCA score plot is shown. As expected the metabolome
of the leaf changes through time, similar changes are
observed in the infected leaves (mainly in PC1), but on
top of that in PC2 or PC3 clear differences between
leaves from the infected and control plants can be
observed.
By using the various 2D NMR methods, a number of
signals that are clearly involved in the SAR response
and direct defense against the infection could be
identified (see above). In Fig. 11, the various changes
are summarized. Apparently some of the effects occur
in the infected leaves and SAR leaves, whereas others
only in the SAR or the infected leaves. The meaning of
the various changes need of course further study. But
obviously this systems biology type of approach using
NMR-based metabolomics, gives many novel leads for
further study.
NMR-based metabolomics platform
These various examples nicely show the great
potential of NMR as a tool for having a macroscopic
view on the plant metabolome. It is thus of great
interest in functional genomics studies as well as in
systems biology studies on all kind of biological
processes. But such a platform has also many other
fields of application, such as quality control of
botanicals and food (Choi et al. 2005; Kim et al.
2005; Yang et al. 2006); phenotyping of plants for
breeders rights (Fernie et al. 2004; Fiehn et al. 2000;
Fukusaki and Kobayashi 2005; Roessner et al. 2002);
studies on the compounds related to pharmacological
activity in medicinal plants (Joshi et al. 2002);

screening programs (Nord et al. 2001); equivalence of
genetically modified plants with non-GM plants
(Fernie et al. 2004; Manetti et al. 2004; Noteborn
et al. 2000; Roessner et al. 2001, 2002).
The great success of the NMR-based metabolomic
studies on urine for, e.g., diagnosis of diseases (Bollard
et al. 2005; Kochhar et al. 2006; Lindon et al. 2003) and
studying toxicity of compounds in animal models
(Gavaghan et al. 2000, 2002; Potts et al. 2001) can serve
as a good example how plant metabolomics may fur-
ther develop. Analyzing the much more complex me-
tabolome of plants if compared with the various bodies
fluids such as urine and serum, will be a major chal-
lenge for the coming years. Though the number of
compounds that are detected in an extract is limited,
still the NMR spectra give a good picture of what really
is present. Minor compounds might not be seen, but
the major trends are clear. By combining the NMR-
metabolomic data with a more targeted approach (LC–
MS, GC–MS) for those compounds that seem to be of
interest one would have the broadest possible infor-
mation on the metabolome. It can be compared with a
microscope zooming in on smaller units. The NMR
gives us the general overall view, the macroscopic view.
Of course the question could be raised how many
compounds can be seen in NMR. The answer is many,
but the number of compounds actually present in an
extract is much smaller. In fact not all the common
compounds we have in our database are detected in all
plant extracts. By using both 1D and 2D NMR spec-
trometry, one may say that about 50–100 compounds
can be detected, and the absence (or below threshold)
of another 50–100 can also be concluded. For the fur-
ther development of the NMR platform first of all a
database with all common compounds is required. But

that also requires agreement on the solvents used for
the NMR-metabolomics. In our experience, buffered
methanol–water (1:1) is an excellent solvent for
studying a broad range of primary and secondary
metabolites. This might be further completed by a non-
polar solvent, though the compounds found in such
extracts are usually lipids and terpenoids. Lipids can be
identified as total groups, but not as individual com-
pounds by means of 1D NMR. For terpenoids, the
possibilities for identification of individual compounds
are better.
Our present database of more than 300 common
compounds of plants showed to be very useful for
identification of compounds in the NMR spectra. A
further computerized identification using the projected
2D J-resolved spectra would be an important
improvement.
