Pharmacia 69(3): 681–687. https://doi.org/10.3897/pharmacia.69.e87013AbstractHyperuricemia is a risk factor for gout and other cardiovascular diseases. One of the therapies used is Allopurinol. Unfortunately, it has unwanted side effects. These conditions made researchers continue to seek and develop alternative treatments from natural products. One of which is from plants of the Phyllanthus genus. One of their contents was polyphenols, especially flavonoids. It is an alternative treatment for hyperuricemia because of its minimal side effects. The flavonoids in this genus were reported to have xanthine oxidase inhibitory: quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, apigenin, luteolin, myricetin, catechin, epicatechin, and epigallocatechin with IC50 values  from 0.44 M to > 100μM. The presence of π-π interactions between planar rings A and C on flavones with phe 1009 and phe 914 and the addition of hydroxyl groups on flavonoid compounds plays a crucial role in inhibiting xanthine oxidase.Keywordsflavonoids, hyperuricemia, IC50, phyllanthus, xanthine oxidaseIntroductionThe genus Phyllanthus is a plant group of the Phyllant-haceae family that consists of 1,301 species and is distri-buted widely in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, America, and Australia (GBIF 2021). In Asia, the-se plants are ethnopharmacologically used in ayurvedic medicine, astringent, abdominal pain, diuretic, febrifuge, deobstruent, antiseptic, and used for the treatment of di-gestion, genitourinary, respiratory, skin diseases, hepa-topathy, jaundice, and renal calculus (Kiran et al. 2021). In South America, as a traditional use to treat excess uric acid (Murugaiyah and Chan 2009). Several plants of this genus have been used to treat constipation, hypertensi-on, fever, respiratory inflammation, muscle aches, diarr-hea, gallbladder disease, urinary tract disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes, wounds, rheumatism, and arthritis (Ongchai 2019).Increased activity of one of the prominent pro-oxidant enzymes: xanthine oxidase (XO), is involved in the patho-genesis of several diseases such as gout, inflammation, heart failure, stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperten-sion, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. XO inhibition is the most widely accepted and effective treatment strategy for gout, hyperuricemia, and associated renal dysfunction (Ayyapan and Nampoothiri 2020). Allopurinol can provide inhibitory activity against the xanthine oxidase enzyme to reduce uric acid in gout. When administered in appropriate doses, its wide availa-bility, low cost, and efficacy make allopurinol the recom-Copyright Husnunnisa H et al.

Allopurinol also has serious potential and life-threatening side effects. There were hypersensitivity, stevens-johnson syndrome, skin eruption, fever, involvement of inter-nal organs, agranulocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (which was marked by necrosis and peeling of the epidermis > 30% of the body surface area accompanied by a burning sen-sation), sick and can cause death (Mari et al. 2011; Stamp et al. 2020), so it’s necessary to develop alternative treat-ments that can reduce uric acid levels.This plant of the Phyllanthus genus contains alkaloids and terpenoids, polyphenolic compounds such as flavo-noids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, anthocyanins, coumarins, and lignins (Kiran et al. 2021). Unlike antihyperuricemic drugs, polyphenol intake from food has few or no side effects, so it is likely that as an alternative treatment for hyperuricemia (Zhu et al. 2021).The present review article will summarize and provide a comprehensive update on the last 10th years regarding the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of polyphenol-ic compounds in plants of the Phyllanthus genus. This review covers the literature from the previous 10th years using the keywords: Phyllanthus, traditional use, ethno-botany, ethnopharmacology, pharmacology, chemical compounds, flavonoids, inflammation, antioxidants, and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity in searches using the Google Scholar database, Science Direct, Pubmed, Sprin-gerlink and Scopus.Ethnopharmacological usesIn Asia, Phyllanthus emblica L. (P. emblica) has been used as a medicinal plant to treat diseases. The fruit of Phyl-lanthus emblica Linn or Emblica officinalis Gaertn (Phy-llanthaceae), commonly known as Indian gooseberry or Amla, is used in indigenous traditional medicine systems, including Ayurveda, to treat several ailments: colds, hay fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, cephalalgia, ophthalmopathy, dyspepsia, colic, flatulence, hyperacidity, peptic ulcer, erysipelas, skin disease, leprosy, hematoge-nesis, inflammation, anemia, emaciation, hepatopathy, jaundice, diarrhea, dysentery, bleeding, vaginal dischar-ge, menorrhagia, heart disorders, and hair loss premature graying (Li et al. 2020; Saini et al. 2022). In India, Asia, the Caribbean, and America, Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels has traditionally been used to treat various diseases such as inflammation, gastric problems, rheumatism, bronchi-tis, asthma, respiratory disorders, diabetes, and hepatitis (Hossen et al. 2015; Tan et al. 2020). In Indonesia, Thai-land, and India, the young leaves of Phyllanthus acidus are commonly used as an edible vegetable, and its aqueous in-fusion is a diet aid for weight loss (Geng et al. 2021).Traditionally, Phyllanthus niruri is used as an anti-urolithiasis, antidiabetic, and antihyperuricemic agent (Murugaiyah and Chan 2009; Beidokhti et al. 2017; Kasote et al. 2017). In Asia, it is used in traditional medicine for liver protection and antihepatitis B (Liu et al. 2014). This plant is also traditionally used to treat kidney stones (Alves et al. 2021). Phyllanthus amarus Schum. & Thon was used traditionally in Indian ayurvedic medicine to treat various ailments: stomach problems, genitourinary system, liver, kidney and spleen, diuretic, febrifuge, antiseptic, gonor-rhea, menorrhagia, gastropathy, diarrhea, dysentery, oph-thalmopathy, scabies, ulcers and wound (Patel et al. 2011). Phyllanthus orbicularis (P. orbicularis) (Phyllanthaceae) is a tropical plant endemic to Cuba and is used in tradition-al medicine as an infusion. This plant extract has various pharmacological activities such as antimutagenic, antiox-idant, and antiviral (Francioso et al. 2019). Phyllanthus phillyreifolius (P. phillyreifolius), a plant species native to Reunion Island, is used in traditional medicine to treat di-arrhea and as a diuretic (Grauzdytė et al. 2018a).Chemical constituentsPlants of the Phyllanthus genus contain metabolites in the form of alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyphenolic com-pounds such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, an-thocyanins, coumarins, and lignins which can be seen in Table 1.Table 1.

Phyllanthus debilis Quercetin 3′ -O-glucoside In vitro glochidon has moderate dose-dependent inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, α-amylase, DPP-4, and PPAR-γ. The docking and MD results also showed that glochidon had moderate activity to inhibit DPP-4 and PPAR-γ, compared with standard agents and a strong tendency to interact with the GLUT1 protein. Computational ADME profiling determined that glochidon has excellent characteristics in acting as a hypoglycemic compound. In vivo, experimental results showed that at a dose of 20 mg/kg, glochidon significantly increased body weight, plasma insulin, HDL levels, and other biochemical markers. In addition, it lowers blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and very-low-density lipoprotein.Kiran et al. 2021Betulinic acid Verma et al. 2021Gallocatechin(2R,3S,4S)-leucodelphinidinDelphinidin-3-O- β -D-glucoside4.

Phyllanthus virgatus Quercetin 3′ -O-glucoside The methanol extract of Phyllanthus virgatus showed intense antioxidant activity and protection against oxidative DNA damage. In addition, the methanol extract of Phyllanthus virgatus inhibited α-amylase (IC50 = 33.20 ± 0.556 μg/mL), noncompetitively, compared to acarbose (IC50 76, 88 ± 0.277 μg/mL), which is competitive inhibition. Moreover, this extract triggered glucose uptake activity in 3T3-L1 cells and showed a good correlation between antioxidant activity and α-amylase. Molecular docking studies of the main bioactive compounds (9,12-octadecadienoic acid, asarone, 11-octadecenoic acid, and acrylic) via GC-MS analysis of these extracts indicate that the inhibitory properties might be due to the synergistic effect of these bioactive compounds.Kiran et al. 2021Betulinic acid Hashim et al. 2013ZeatinDelphinidin-3-O- β -D-glucosideKaempferol-3-glucosideRutinEllagic AcidHypophyllanthinQuercetinHusnunnisa H et al.: Review of flavonoid from Phyllanthaceae684No. Species Chemical Compound Pharmacological Activity References10.

The aqueous extract of Phyllanthus orbicularis used as a protector against DNA damage caused by exposure to sunlight (UV). Procyanidins B1 and B2 provided antiviral activity by inhibiting HSV-2 replication and DNA synthesis with EC(50) values  = 32.8 µg/mL and 24.2 µg/mL, respectively.Francioso et al. 2019Epicatechin Vernhes et al. 2013Procyanidin B2 Tamayo et al. 2018Rutoside Alvarez et al. 2012NicotiflorinKaempferolProcyanidin C1Fideloside12. Phyllanthus phillyreifoliusRutin Phyllanthus phillyreifolius extract has pharmacological activity as an anticancer, antiviral, antioxidant, and antibacterial.Grauzdytė et al. 2018aQuercetin-3-glucuronide Haddad et al. 2020Quercitrin Grauzdytė et al. 2018bMahomoodally et al. 2019Xanthine oxidaseLipoxygenases (LOX), cyclooxygenases (Coxs), and xanthi-ne oxidase (XO) are metalloenzymes whose catalytic cycles involve ROS, such as lipid peroxyl radicals, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. LOX and Coxs will catalyze the prime steps of the leukotriene biosynthesis and prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. They are crucial cascades in the in-flammatory response (Dangles and Dufour 2006). XO is a predominant enzyme in the metabolism of purines to uric acid, catalyzing the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. The chief role of XO in this path-way makes it a therapeutic target for hyperuricemia manage-ment. Allopurinol, oxypurinol, and febuxostat can inhibit the xanthine oxidase in the purine nucleotide degradation pathway, decreasing uric acid production. In addition, allo-purinol and oxypurinol inhibit the enzyme orotidine-5′ mo-nophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC). This condition leads to orotic acid accumulation. Allopurinol and oxypurinol can defeat amidotransferase and PNP activity, but febuxostat cannot inhibit PNP and OMPDC2. Flavonoids may exert their antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities by reser-ving the LOX, COX, and XO (Dangles and Dufour 2006).Flavonoids as xanthine oxidase inhibitorsFlavonoids are a group of phenolic compounds with many properties, especially in counteracting free radicals in vitro and in vivo. Many studies have shown that flavonoids can inhibit the production of ROS enzymes, such as xan-thine oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and myeloperoxidase (Atmani et al. 2009). Several flavonoids that play a role in the inhibitory activity of the xanthine oxidase enzyme are summarized in Table 2.Planar rings A and C of flavones have π-π interactions with phe 1009 and phe 914, required for xanthine oxidase inhibition. However, the planar flavone framework alone is not sufficient to induce xanthine oxidase inhibition. A hydroxyl group at position 7 plays a role in the xanthine oxidase inhibition by flavones. The addition of the 5-hy-droxyl group and the 7-hydroxyl decreased the IC50 value significantly. The structural similarity between 5,7-dihy-droxyflavone (ring A) and enol xanthine indicates the same binding site in the allosteric center of xanthine oxi-dase (Hoorn et al. 2002).The hydroxyl groups at positions C-5 and C-7 with the C2-C3 double bond play a key role in XO inhibito-ry activity. Flavones are slightly better XO inhibitors than flavonols, and all derivatives of flavonoids, except for isorhamnetin, are less active than the original compound (Atmani et al. 2009). 7-Hydroxyflavones is one of the flavones with one hydroxyl group with xanthine oxidase inhibitory capacity (≤40 µM), and flavone with one hy-droxyl moiety has an IC50 value much higher than 40 µM. There was a significant decrease in the IC50 value when a hydroxyl group was added to C3’ or C4’. At 3’-hydroxyl, Pharmacia 69(3): 681–687 685the IC50 value decreased from 1 to 0.75 µM when apigenin was compared with luteolin and changed from 2.5 to 1.5 µM when kaempferol was compared with quercetin. The presence of a 4’-hydroxyl group increased the inhib-itory activity compared to a flavone group that did not have a 4’-hydroxyl group. Luteolin is a flavone compound with hydroxyl groups at 5,7,3’ and 4’ positions providing the best xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity with the low-est IC50 value compared to other flavonoid groups. Several hydroxyl groups were also present that showed decreased xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity (Hoorn et al. 2002).The presence of a 2’-hydroxyl group can lower the in-hibitory activity of xanthine oxidase, which can being see from the increase in the IC50 value of flavonoid compounds that have a 2’-hydroxyl group, for example, kaempferol (without 2’-hydroxyl group) compared to morin (the presence of a 2’-hydroxyl group), where the IC50 value in-creased from 2.5 to 40 µM, respectively. The presence of 3-hydroxyl can also attenuate the inhibition of xanthine oxidase, luteolin compared with quercetin (the presence of a 3-hydroxyl group) showed an increase in IC50 from 0.75 to 1.5 µM, respectively. The addition of the 8-hydrox-yl group increased the IC50 value from 4 to 10 µM when 7.3’,4’-trihydroxyflavone compared with 7,8,3’,4’-tetrahy-droxyflavone. The 5’-hydroxyl group doesn’t influence the inhibitory activity of xanthine oxidase (Hoorn et al. 2002).The presence of hydroxyl groups at positions C-3 and C-3’ plays a role in superoxide scavenging activity (Atma-ni et al. 2009). Flavonoids can act as enzyme inhibitors via the formation of enzyme-inhibitor complexes and prevent the formation of superoxide and uric acid. Or by superox-ide scavenging. These can be recorded independently us-ing chemiluminescence colorimetric methods. Based on their activity, flavonoids can be grouped into superoxide inhibitors without inhibitory activity on XO, XO inhibi-tors without superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 for uric acid formation ≈ IC50 for superoxide inhibition), XO in-hibitors with superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 for uric acid formation > IC50 for superoxide scavenging), XO in-hibitors with added pro-oxidant effect in superoxide for-mation (IC50 for uric acid formation < IC50 for superoxide scavenging), weak XO inhibitors with pro-oxidant effect on superoxide formation, and flavonoids without inhibi-tory effects on XO and superoxide. The planar C ring (fla-vones, flavonols) plays a role in XO inhibition (IC50 0.5 to 10 µM except for 3-Hydroxyflavones, which do not inter-act with XO) (Dangles and Dufour 2006).Catechins have superoxide scavenging activity and do not interact with XO. Only flavonols with a catechol group in ring B (quercetin, myricetin, fisetin) showed additional superoxide activity. In contrast, some hydrox-ylated flavones (chrysin, apigenin, luteolin) exhibit un-derlying pro-oxidant activity. Interestingly, glycosidation of the flavonoid core generally abolishes XO inhibition. For example, the IC50 values  of quercetin for XO inhi-bition and superoxide scavenging were 2.6 and 1.6 µM, respectively. Quercetin-3-O rhamnoside (quercitrin) had an IC50 of 8.1 µM to ward off superoxide but could not in-hibit XO (IC50 > 100 µM). Similarly, Q3GlcU and Q7GlcU were very poor inhibitors of XO (Kd 100 µM). However, Q3’GlcU (Kd 1.4 µM) and Q4’GlcU (Kd 0.25 µM) exerted intense inhibition activity against XO, which was as strong as quercetin. Therefore, while glucuronidation at the 3’ or 4’ position suppresses the free catechol moiety of ring B and thus has radical scavenging activity, XO affinity has been spared as if flavonol-XO binding occurs with mar-ginal participation of ring B (Dangles and Dufour 2006).Epicatechin and its oligomers have no inhibitory ac-tivity against XO. In contrast, an oligomer of epicate-chin-3-O-gallate (4β-8 Interflavan linkage) are inhibitors whose potency increases with the number of monomer units (IC50 7.2 to 4.4 µM from dimer to tetramer). Thus, the French maritime pine bark extract (pycnogenol) rich in procyanidins (75% by weight, DP 2 to 7) find to signif-icantly reduce XO activity and inhibit protein electropho-retic mobility only under non-denaturation. In addition, the pure low molecular weight extract components had no effect. Therefore, it concludes that XO inhibition occurs by binding to XO of high DP procyanidins (DP > 3) (Dan-gles and Dufour 2006).Table 2.

They were quer-cetin, kaempferol, rutin, apigenin, luteolin, myricetin, ca-techin, epicatechin, and epigallocatechin. Their IC50 was from 0.44 µM to > 100 μM. Quercetin and apigenin show the great activity of xanthine oxidase inhibitory compa-red to other flavonoids found in plants of the Phyllanthus genus with an IC50 value of 0.44 µM. The presence of – in-teractions between planar rings A and C on flavones with phe 1009 and phe 914, plays a chief role in inhibiting xan-thine oxidase. Adding hydroxyl groups to flavonoid com-pounds can increase or decrease the inhibitory activity of xanthine oxidase. The hydroxyl groups at positions 5, 7, 3’, and 4’ can increase the inhibitory activity of xanthine oxi-dase, while the hydroxyl groups at 2’, 3, and 8 will decrease the inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase.AcknowledgementsThe author would like to thank the Department of Phar-maceutical Biology, School of Pharmacy, Bandung Insti-tute of Technology, for the facilities, and support that has been provided.ReferencesAlvarez AL, Dalton KP, Nicieza I, Diñeiro Y, Picinelli A, Melón S, Roque A, Suárez B, Parra F (2012) Bioactivity-guided fractionation of Phyllanthus orbicularis and identification of the principal anti HSV-2 compounds.
