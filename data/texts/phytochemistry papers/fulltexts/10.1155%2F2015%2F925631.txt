It is a warm-climate, herbaceous succulent annual plant with a cosmopolitan distribution. It is eaten extensively as apotherb and added in soups and salads around theMediterranean and tropical Asian countries and has been used as a folkmedicinein many countries. Diverse compounds have been isolated from Portulaca oleracea, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides,fatty acids, terpenoids, sterols, proteins vitamins and minerals. Portulaca oleracea possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacologicalproperties such as neuroprotective, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiulcerogenic, and anticanceractivities. However, few molecular mechanisms of action are known. This review provides a summary of phytochemistry andpharmacological effects of this plant.1. IntroductionPortulaca oleracea L. is a warm-climate, herbaceous succulentannual plant with a cosmopolitan distribution belonging tothe Portulacaceae family. It is commonly known as purslane(USA and Australia), rigla (Egypt), pigweed (England),pourpier (France), and Ma-Chi-Xian (China) [1]. It is dis-tributed widely in the tropical and subtropical areas of theworld including many parts of the United States and is eatenextensively as a potherb and is added to soups and saladsaround the Mediterranean and tropical Asian countries [2].Americans and aborigines of Australia grind the seeds of thisplant into flour for use in mush and bread [3]. Portulacaoleracea also provides a source of nutritional benefits owingto its rich omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant properties [4].Portulaca oleracea has been used as a folk medicine inmany countries, acting as a febrifuge, antiseptic, vermifuge,and so forth [5]. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacologicaleffects, including antibacterial [6], antiulcerogenic [7], anti-inflammatory [8], antioxidant [9], and wound-healing [10]properties. It is listed by the World Health Organizationas one of the most used medicinal plants, and it has beengiven the term “Global Panacea” [11]. The Chinese folkloredescribed it as “vegetable for long life” and it has been used forthousands of years in traditional Chinese Medicine [12, 13]. Itis cold in nature and sour in taste and is used to cool the blood,stanch bleeding, clear heat, and resolve toxins. The driedaerial part of this plant is indicated for the treatment of fever,dysentery, diarrhoea, carbuncle, eczema and hematochezia,with a recommended dose of 9–15 g [14–16].Hindawi Publishing CorporationBioMed Research InternationalVolume 2015, Article ID 925631, 11 pageshttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/9256312 BioMed Research InternationalPortulaca oleracea has a high potential to be used ashuman and animal food and to be utilized as a pharmaco-logical agent in medicine. In this paper, phytochemistry andpharmacological activities of this plant are reviewed and itspotential for further investigation, exploitation, and utiliza-tion are discussed.2. PhytochemistryMany constituents of Portulaca oleracea have been iso-lated, including flavonoids, alkaloids, fatty acids, terpenoids,polysaccharides, vitamins, sterols, proteins, and minerals;these are listed in Table 1 and the chemical structures of themain compounds are presented in Figure 1.One of the most effective constituents present in ChineseHerbal Medicines are flavonoids which are biologically activeand possess a wide range of pharmacological properties suchas antibacterial, antivirus, anti-inflammation, and antioxida-tion properties. In the Portulaca oleracea plant, the flavonoidslevels vary according to the part of the plant; the highest levelsare present in the root followed by stem and the leaf; andseven different flavonoids are present in this plant, includingkaempferol, myricetin, luteolin, apigenin, quercetin, genis-tein, and genistin [17]. However, only kaempferol and api-genin have been found in ethanolic extracts of leaves andstems, with the levels in the former being higher [11]. Portula-canones B–D, three homoisoflavonoids compounds, displayselectively cytotoxic activities against three human cancer celllines (SF-268, NCI-H460, and SGC-7901) [18]. Flavonoids arealso widely present in foods such as fruits and vegetables [19].In addition to flavonoids, another important chemicalfound in this plant is alkaloids including dopa, dopamine,andnoradrenalin.The content of dopamine andnoradrenalinis higher in leaves compared to stem and seeds. The amountof dopamine and noradrenalin obtained from leaves variesaccording to the solvents used in the extraction process,suggesting that the levels of these compounds are dependenton the solvents used during the extraction process [20].Oleraceins A, B, C, D, and E are cyclodopa alkaloids isolatedfrom this plant [21] and several analytes such as (3R)-3,5-bis(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-2(1H)-pyridi-none and 1,5-dimethyl-6-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one display cytotoxic activities against human cancercells [22].Portulaca oleracea is also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which is usually present in oil and fat of fishesbut not normally found in plants. Omega-3 fatty acids playan important role in the enhancement of immune function[23] and prevention and treatment of hypertension, coronaryartery disease, cancer, and other inflammatory and autoim-mune disorders [24]. It includes 𝛼-linolenic acid and linoleicacid, which are essential for normal growth, health pro-motion, and disease prevention in humans. Polysaccharidesfound in Portulaca oleracea are potential therapeutic agentsfor the treatment of diabetes mellitus owing to their mod-ulation of blood lipids, metabolism, and decrease of bloodglucose. Portulaca oleracea contains monoterpenes such asportulosides A and B, diterpenes such as portulene, and 𝛽-amyrin type triterpenoids [1, 25]; in addition, vitamins havealso been isolated from the leaves of this plant. It contains thehighest content of vitamin A which is a natural antioxidantplaying an important role in vision, maintaining healthymucus membranes and protecting against lung and oral cav-ity cancers among green leafy vegetables.This plant also con-tains ascorbic acid, 𝛼-tocopherol, and B-complex vitamins,for example, niacin, pyridoxine, and riboflavin [26]. Further-more it is rich in minerals like phosphorus, manganese, icon,calcium selenium [3], and the amino acids isoleucine, proline,leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, methionine, cystine, valine,threonine, and tyrosine [2]. Many other constituents havealso been isolated from this plant, such as 𝛽-carotene,glutathione, melatonin, portulacerebroside A, catechol, andbergapten.3. PharmacologyOver the past decades, numerous researchers have investi-gated the pharmacological activities of Portulaca oleracea.This review provides a comprehensive summary of the mainpharmacological properties which are presented below.3.1. Neuroprotective Activity. Administration of Portulacaoleracea can scavenge free radicals and antagonize rotenone-induced neurons apoptosis, dopamine depletion, and com-plex-I inhibition in striatum of rats, suggesting that Portulacaoleraceamay be a potential neuroprotective candidate againstParkinson’s disease [23]. The extract of Portulaca oleracea(EP) protects nerve tissue/cells from hypoxic damage prob-ably by elevation of glycolysis, EPO, and hypoxia induciblefactor-1 expression levels [27]. The ethanol extract decreasesthe activity of caspase-3 in neuron whilst reducing serumlevels of neuron specific enolase in hypoxia mice and thepathological damages caused by hypoxia. In these studies,an increase in the neuron viability and an induction in themRNA and protein expression of endogenous erythropoietinhave also been reported. Thus, the stabilization of hypoxiainducible factor-1 𝛼 expression is associated with the neu-roprotective effects of EP against hypoxia injury by elicitingendogenous erythropoietin expression [28]. 𝛽-Cyanin evi-dently inhibits D-galactose-induced neurotoxicity in mice,which at the doses of 50 and 100mg/kg upregulates the activi-ties of superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione reductase,and glutathione peroxidase, whilst reducing the level of thelipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde in the brain ofD-galactose-treated mice. When compared to vitamin C, 𝛽-cyanin play a more pronounced effect on alleviating cogni-tion deficits in mice [29]. The total alkaloidal extracts from31 traditional Chinese Herbal Medicines were tested for theiracetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities by Ellman’smethod and modified TLC bioautographic assay. As a result,the alkaloidal extract ofPortulaca oleracea significantly inhib-ited AChE activity at a final concentration of 100 𝜇g/mL withthe IC50 value of 29.4 𝜇g/mL.The use of AChE inhibitors hasbeen a promising treatment strategy for Alzheimer’s disease(AD); therefore, Portulaca oleraceamay be an effective agentfor the prophylaxis and treatment of AD [30].BioMed Research International 3Table 1: Compounds isolated from purslane.Classification Chemical component Part of plant ReferenceFlavonoidsKaempferol (1) Leaf and stem [11]Apigenin (2) Leaf and stem [11]Luteolin (3) Whole plant [11]Myricetin (4) Whole plant [11]Quercetin (5) Whole plant [11]Portulacanones A (6) Aerial part [18]Portulacanones B (7) Aerial part [18]Portulacanones C (8) Aerial part [18]Portulacanones D (9) Aerial part [18]2,2󸀠-Dihydroxy-4󸀠,6󸀠-dimethoxychalcone (10) Aerial parts [18]Genistein Whole plant [17]Genistin Whole plant [17]AlkaloidsDopamine (11) Stem, leaf and seed [20]Noradrenalin (12) Stem, leaf and seed [48]Dopa [21]Oleraceins A (13) Whole plant [21]Oleraceins B (14) Whole plant [21]Oleraceins C (15) Whole plant [21]Oleraceins D (16) Whole plant [21]Oleraceins E (17) Whole plant [21]Oleracins I Stem [21]Oleracins II Stem [21]Adenosine Whole plant [21]N-trans-Feruloyltyramine (18) Aerial part [22](7󸀠R)-N-Feruloylnormetanephrine (19) Aerial part [22]1,5-Dimethyl-6-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one (20) Aerial part [22](3R)-3,5-Bis(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-2(1H)-pyridinone (21) Aerial part [22]Thymine (22) Aerial parts [18]Uracil (23) Aerial parts [18]N-cis-Feruloyltyramine (24) Aerial parts [18]N-trans-Feruloyloctopamine (25) Aerial parts [18]N-cis-Feruloyloctopamine (26) Aerial parts [18]Trollisine (27) Aerial part [49]Aurantiamide (28) Aerial part [49]Aurantiamide acetate (29) Aerial part [49]Cyclo(L-tyrosinyl-L-tyrosinyl) (30) Aerial part [49]1,5-Dimethyl-6-phenyl-1,6,3,4-tetrahydro-1,2,4-2(1H)-triazin (31) Aerial part [49]Scopoletin [50]TerpenoidsPortuloside A (32) Aerial part [51]Portuloside B (33) Aerial part [52](3S)-3-O-(𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyl)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-ol (34) Aerial part [52](3S)-3-O-(𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyl)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,5-dien-3,7-diol (35) Aerial part [52]Portulene (36) Aerial part [1]Lupeol (37) Aerial part [1](2a,3a)-3-{[4-O-(𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyl)-𝛽-D-xylopyranosyl]oxy}-2,23-dihydroxy-30-methoxy-30-oxoolean-12-en-28-oic acid(38)Aerial part [25](2a,3a)-2,23,30-Trihydroxy-3-[(𝛽-D-xylopyranosyl)oxy]olean-12-en-28-oic acid (39) Aerial part [25]Friedelane Aerial part [25]4 BioMed Research InternationalTable 1: Continued.Classification Chemical component Part of plant ReferenceOrganicacids3-Quinolinecarboxylic acid (40) Aerial parts [18]Indole-3-carboxylic acid (41) Aerial parts [18]a-Linolenic acid Leaf [24]Linoleic acid Leaf [26]Palmitic acid Leaf [4]Stearic acid Leaf [4]Oleic acid Leaf [4]p-Coumaric acid Whole plant [21]Ferulic acid Whole plant [21]Docosapentaenoic acid Stem [26]Eicosapentaenoic acid [53]Docosahexaenoic acid [53]Catechol [53]Caffeic acid Aerial part [54]Oxalic acid Leaf [2]Lonchocarpic acid [50]VitaminsVitamin A Leaf [26]Riboflavin Leaf [26]Niacin Leaf [26]Pyridoxine Leaf [26]Vitamin C Leaf [26]Folates Leaf [26]Pantothenic acid Leaf [26]Thiamin Leaf [26]𝛼-Tocopherol Leaf [4]Hesperidin Leaf [55]MineralsPhosphorus Root, stem and leaf [3]Iron Root, stem and leaf [3]Manganese Root, stem and leaf [3]Calcium Root, stem and leaf [3]Copper Root, stem and leaf [3]Zinc Leaf [26]Selenium Leaf [26]Magnesium Leaf [26]OthercompoundsPortulacerebroside A (42) Aerial part [56]𝛽-Sitosterol (43) Aerial part [1]Daucosterol (44) Aerial part [1]𝛽-Carotene Leaf [4]Glutathione Leaf [4]Proline Leaf [57]Melatonin Leaf [24]1,4-Di-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-methyl-L-arabinitol Leaf [58]1,4,5-Tri-O-acetyl-2,3-di-O-methyl-L-arabinitol Leaf [58]1,5-Di-O-acetyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-D-galactitol Leaf [58]1,4,5-Tri-O-acetyl-2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-D-galactitol Leaf [58]1,3,4,5-Tetra-O-acetyl-2,6-di-O-methyl-D-galactitol Leaf [58]Chlorophyll [53]Tannin [53]BioMed Research International 5Table 1: Continued.Classification Chemical component Part of plant ReferenceIsopimpinellin [50]Robustin [50]Bergapten [50]3.2. Antidiabetic Activity. Portulaca oleracea attenuates bodyweight, serum free fatty acids, and hyperinsulinemia. Italso increases insulin sensitivity and ameliorates impairedglucose tolerance and lipid metabolism in rats with type2 diabetes mellitus induced by injection of streptozotocin(25mg/kg) and feeding of high calorie forage, suggesting thatPortulaca oleracea alleviates insulin resistance [31]. Admin-istration of the seeds powder (5 g × 2/day) increases highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and albumin, whilelowering the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides,low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), liver gammaglutamyl transaminase (GGT), alanine transaminase (ALT),aspartate transaminase (AST), total and direct bilirubin,fasting and postprandial blood glucose, insulin, body weight,and body mass index in type 2 diabetic subjects. There wereno differences in these results compared to the data obtainedwith metformin treatment (1500mg/day) except for LDLC,HDLC, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, suggestingthat Portulaca oleracea seeds are valuable and effective as anadjunctive and alternative therapy for the treatment of type 2diabetes mellitus [32].The aqueous extract of Portulaca oleracea also preventsdiabetic vascular inflammation, hyperglycemia, and diabeticendothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic db/db mice,suggesting its protective role against diabetes and relatedvascular complications [33].The crude polysaccharide extractof this plant also lowers blood glucose and modulates themetabolism of blood lipids and glucose in alloxan-induceddiabeticmice [34], whilst decreasing the levels of total choles-terol, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose in type 2diabetic mice [32].3.3. Antioxidant Activity. The antioxidant property of Por-tulaca oleracea is attributed to its constituents, such as gal-lotannins, omega-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, 𝛼-tocopherols,kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin [8, 16, 17].The single cellgel electrophoresis assay (comet assay), which is an simple,rapid, and inexpensive method for measuring DNA strandbreaks, confirmed that the aqueous extract significantlyalleviated hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA lesionsin human lymphocytes, whereas the ethanolic extract had noeffects, which may be associated with the antioxidant con-stituents contained in the aqueous extract [35]. The aqueousextract decreases high fat diet-elicited oxidative damage bymodulating blood and liver antioxidant enzyme activities,elevating leptin/𝛽-actin and liver PPARa/𝛽-actin and inhibit-ing the protein expression of p-PERK and the FAS mRNAexpression of liver and spleen in mice [9]. In another study,the aqueous extract at a concentration range of 100, 150, 200,and 400 𝜇g/mL and the ethanolic extract at a range of 1200and 1800 𝜇g/mL, respectively, exerted cytoprotective effectson 2,2󸀠-azobis hydrochloride-induced hemolytic damages ofRBCs in a concentration-dependent manner [36].3.4. Anticancer Activity. Polysaccharides from Portulacaoleracea display several biological activities, such as anti-cancer, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and immunityenhancing properties [37–40]. Polysaccharides evidentlyscavenge the accumulation of free radicals and modulateimmunity functions of rats with ovarian cancer [41]. Sulfatedderivatives of POP, a water-soluble polysaccharide isolatedfrom Portulaca oleracea, have a suppressive effect on thegrowth of HeLa and HepG2 cells in vitro, suggesting that thesulfation of POP increases the cytotoxicity in tumor cells [42].In addition to polysaccharides, other bioactive compoundssuch as cerebrosides, homoisoflavonoids, and alkaloids alsoshow in vitro cytotoxic activities against human cancer celllines. Portulacerebroside A stimulates human liver cancerHCCLM3 cell apoptosis via the activation of the p38 MAPK-and JNK-triggered mitochondrial death pathway [43] and2,2󸀠-dihydroxy-4󸀠,6󸀠-dimethoxychalcone is more activeagainst cell line SGC-7901 with an IC50value of 1.6 ug/mLthan mitomycin C which has an IC50value of 13.0 ug/mL.Portulacanones B is active against SGC-7901 cell lines withan IC50value of 16.2 ug/mL, which is very close to thevalue obtained with mitomycin C. 2,2󸀠-Dihydroxy-4󸀠,6󸀠-dimethoxychalcone is moderately active against K-562 cellswith an IC50value of 24.6 ug/mL and portulacanones B–Dshow selective cytotoxic activity against SF-268 and/orNCI-H460 cells with IC50values of 14.3–20.1 ug/mL [18]. N-trans-Feruloyltyramine, (7󸀠R)-N-feruloylnormetanephrine,1,5-dimethyl-6-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one,and (3R)-3,5-bis(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-2(1H)-pyridinone have weak bioactivities against K562with IC50values of 222.77, 66.94, 90.09, and 41.52 umol/L,respectively, and moderate bioactivities against A549 withIC50values of 28.80, 21.76, 24.54, and 37.20 umol/L, respec-tively [22]. These studies demonstrate that Portulaca oleraceahas a potential application in the treatment of cancer.3.5. Antimicrobial. Portulaca oleracea possesses antibacterial,antifungal, and antiviral activities as revealed by its antifungaleffect against dermatophytes of the genera Trichophyton [44].A pectic polysaccharide isolated from the aerial part of thisplant displays antiherpes property against simplex virus type2 which is due to the inhibition of virus penetration and notvirus adsorption [45]. A 70% methyl alcohol extract of Por-tulaca oleracea shows antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative stains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,and Neisseria gonorrhea with inhibition zones of 14, 15, and15mm, respectively, and the Gram-positive strains: Staphylo-coccus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus faecaliswith6 BioMed Research InternationalOOHOHOHO HOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH OH OHOHOHOH OH OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH(1)OO(2)OO(3)OO(4)OO(5)O OO(6)O OO(7)O OO(8)O OO(9)OO O(10)HOHO HOHO(11)OH(12)O O NHCOOHCOHOHO(13)O O NHCOOHCOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHHOOHOHOHOCH3(14)O O NHCOOHCOOHOO(15)H3COH3COOCH3OCH3CH2CH2NH2 CHCH2NH2Figure 1: Continued.BioMed Research International 7OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO O NHCOOHCOOHOHOOOH(16)NOHOHO(17)NHOOHHO(18)NHO(19)NNHNHO(20)NHHOOHOHOHO(21)HN HNNH NHOO(22)OO(23)HOONHOHO(24)NHOHO(25)HOHOHOONHOHOHO(26)NO(27)NHOHOHNO(28)H3COCH3OCH3CH3OCH3OCH3OCH3OCH3OCH3Figure 1: Continued.8 BioMed Research InternationalNHOOOHNO(29)HNNHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOO(30)NNNHOHOHOH OH(31)OOO(32)OOOOH(33)OO(34)OO(35)HCOOH(36)HOHOHOHOHO(37)O O O OOHOHH(38)O OHOHOHOHOHOHHOHOOHOOHHHOHOHO(39)NHCOOHO(40)NHCOOH(41)O ONH OHOOH(42)HHOHHH HH(43)H3CO(CH2)11(CH2)19Figure 1: Continued.BioMed Research International 9HROHHH HH(44)R = glucoseFigure 1: Chemical structures of main compounds present in Portulaca oleracea.inhibition zones of 13, 14, and 15mm, respectively, as well asantifungal activity against Candida albicans with inhibitionzone of 12mm [1].3.6. Anti-Inflammatory Activity. Pretreatment with the aque-ous extract of Portulaca oleracea inhibits tumor necrosisfactor- (TNF-) 𝛼-induced production of intracellular reac-tive oxygen species (ROS) and overexpression of intercel-lular adhesion molecule- (ICAM-) 1, vascular cell adhesionmolecule (VCAM)-1, and E-selectin in human umbilical veinendothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner.This extract also suppresses the translocation of nuclearfactor 𝜅B (NF-𝜅B) p65 to the nucleus, TNF-𝛼-inducedNF-𝜅Bbinding, and the degradation of inhibitor molecule (I𝜅B)𝛼.Furthermore, an inhibition in the adhesion of HL-60 cellsto TNF-𝛼-induced HUVECs and TNF-𝛼-induced mRNAexpression of interleukin- (IL-) 8 andmonocyte chemoattrac-tant protein- (MCP-) 1 is also observed. The aqueous extractof Portulaca oleracea may also play an important role in thesuppression of the vascular inflammatory process related tothe development of atherosclerosis [46].3.7. Antiulcerogenic Activity. Aqueous and ethanolic extractsof Portulaca oleracea at 0.8 g/kg and 1.4 g/kg, respectively, canreduce the severity of HCl-induced gastric ulcers in a dose-dependent manner; this is comparable to the effect observedwith sucralfate 0.1 g/kg. In addition, the aqueous extract (0.56and 0.8 g/kg) and the ethanolic extract (0.8 and 1.4 g/kg)display suppression of lesions induced by absolute ethanol.The oral and intraperitoneal doses of both extracts dose-dependently increase the pH of gastric juice in mice withpylorus ligation.Thus, Portulaca oleracea holds great promiseas an effective therapeutic agent for gastrointestinal diseasesdue to its gastroprotective activity [7].3.8. Hepatoprotective Activity. Intraperitoneal administra-tion of CCl4elicits liver injury in rats, which notably upreg-ulates the levels of total bilirubin and serum hepatic markerenzymes, including glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT)and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT). A 70%alcohol extract of Portulaca oleracea significantly reverses theincrease in hepatic marker enzymes and total bilirubin levels,confirming the hepatoprotective activity of this plant [1].3.9. Other Activities. The ethanol extract from Portulacaoleracea at a concentration range of 100, 200, and 400mg/kg,respectively, displays a dose-dependent effect in prolongingthe survival time of mice in hypoxic models, including closednormobaric hypoxia and potassiumcyanide or sodiumnitritetoxicosis.This extract also enhances the activities of phospho-fructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase inglycolysis and the level of adenosine triphosphate of mousecortices in hypoxia models [12]. The preliminary woundhealing activity of Portulaca oleracea has been appraised inMus musculus JVI-1 and it has been shown that a fresh crudeextract significantly accelerates the wound healing course bythe stimulation of wound contraction and downregulation ofthe surface area of the excisionwound [10]. Portulaca oleraceaalso has the ability to accumulate Se even at the shortest timespan of 42 days, and hence it can perform the dual functionsof preventing the occurrence of Se deficiency linked diseasessuch as Keshan and Kashin-Beck diseases [47].4. ConclusionPortulaca oleracea is of considerable importance to thefood industry and also possesses a wide spectrum of phar-macological properties such as neuroprotective, antimi-crobial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiul-cerogenic, and anticancer activities, which are associatedwith its diverse chemical constituents, including flavonoids,alkaloids, polysaccharides, fatty acids, terpenoids, sterols,proteins, vitamins, and minerals.Although bioactivities of extracts or compounds isolatedfrom Portulaca oleracea are substantiated by using in vitroand in vivo studies including animal models and cell culturestudies, the mechanisms of action have not been addressed.Hence, more mechanistic studies are required before Portu-laca oleracea can be considered for further clinical use. Thisreview concludes that Portulaca oleracea is an edible and amedicinal plant which is important to the food industry andmay also have a significant role to play in health care providedthat adequate studies are conducted.Conflict of InterestsTheauthors have declared that there is no conflict of interests.10 BioMed Research InternationalAuthors’ ContributionYan-Xi Zhou and Hai-Liang Xin contributed equally to thiswork.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (nos. 81173462 and 81102774), NationalScience and TechnologyMajor Projects forMajor NewDrugsInnovation and Development (2014ZX09J14106-06c), andthe Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory BreedingBase of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization ofChinese Medicine Resources.References[1] E.
