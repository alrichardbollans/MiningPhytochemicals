The genus Duhaldea DC.comprises 15 species widespread in Central, East, and Southeast Asia and7 species (2 endemic) in China. The review aims to provide a systematicoverview of ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacology ofDuhaldea DC. and to explore the future therapeutic potential and scientificpotential of this genus. The data were systematically collected from booksand scientific databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar,CNKI, and doctoral and master’s theses. To date, a total of 352 metaboliteshave been isolated from this genus, and terpenoids, flavonoids,phenylpropanoids, and inositol angelates are the primary contributors to thepharmacological activities of Duhaldea DC. The crude extracts and isolatedphytochemical metabolites from this genus have been shown to exhibitvarious pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial,anti-osteoporotic, anticancer, and antioxidant activities. Despite notableadvancements in our understanding of the chemical constituents andpharmacological properties of Duhaldea DC., it is absolutely crucial toconduct additional research into the pharmacology and toxicology of thesespecies to definitively ascertain their safety, efficacy, and quality.KEYWORDSDuhaldea DC., ethnobotany, pharmacology, phytochemistry, traditional uses1 IntroductionPreviously, plants of the genusDuhaldeaDC. were considered to belong to the genus InulaL. (Cheng et al., 2014a; Li, 2017). However, in the last decade or so, plant taxonomists haveconcluded that these plants should become a separate genus under the family Asteraceae, andthe scientific name of the genus has been revised to Duhaldea DC (Wu and Peter, 2011).DuhaldeaDC consists of 15 species, mainly shrubs or perennial botanical drugs. The genus iswidely distributed in Asia, with seven species in China, of which two are endemic (Wu andPeter, 2011). The stem is erect. The leaves are alternate and densely hairy. The capitulum isoften solitary or found in dense terminal corymbs. It has multiple total bracts, with white edgeOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYZhichao Xu,Northeast Forestry University, ChinaREVIEWED BYLe-Le Zhang,Chengdu University, ChinaZhi Chai,Shanxi University of Chinese medicine, China*CORRESPONDENCELiangjun Guan,guanlj3@163.comShunli Xiao,xiaosl3@163.comRECEIVED 13 August 2024ACCEPTED 31 October 2024PUBLISHED 15 November 2024CITATIONShu L, Li K, Yang S, Hu M, Ming X, Yan B, Guan Land Xiao S (2024) A review on ethnobotany,phytochemistry, and pharmacology of thegenus Duhaldea DC.Front.

The disk florets are bisexual, either yellow or whitish. Theachenes are ellipsoid and hairy, with an epidermis featuring elongatedcrystals (Ding and Jin, 2017).Species in the genus Duhaldea DC. are traditionally used for thetreatment of stomachache, relieving rheumatism, fractures, bonewounds, asthma, headache, rheumatism, peptic ulcers, loose motions,indigestion, bronchitis, angeitides, vasculitis, and dizziness (Long, 2004;Yan et al., 2011; Jyoti et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021a). Duhaldea DC.species are rich in sesquiterpene lactones, sesquiterpenes,phenylpropanoids, inositol derivatives, triterpenes, and flavonoids,which authenticate their medicinal importance (Baruah et al., 1982;Yan et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2014b; Wu et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2015).Anti-inflammatory, piscicidal, anti-osteoporotic, and anticanceractivities exhibited by various extracts and metabolites isolated fromthe genus Duhaldea DC. showed its pharmacological importance(Yoshida et al., 1995; Xie et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013; Tai et al.,2014).D. nervosa andD. cappa are themost popular, widely utilized, andhighly investigated species in the genus despite the relatively low numberof other species within the genus, which are more or less underexplored.This species is an important medicinal species extensively used in Asiancountries to treat stomachache and rheumatism (Yan et al., 2011).This review aims to establish a relationship between traditionaluses and scientific studies by critically assessing the availableliterature on ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, andpharmacology, possible mechanisms of action, and toxicology ofthe plant species from the genus Duhaldea DC. Furthermore, thisreview also highlights the various research gaps for the betterexploitation of this genus and provides a baseline for futureresearch studies. Related scientific literature studies up to March2024 were collected from the following databases: PubMed, Elsevier,Web of Science, Springer, ScienceDirect, Wiley, ACS, CNKI, anddoctoral andmaster’s theses. The search terms included “Duhaldea,”“rubricaulis,” “wissmanniana,” “lachnocephala,” “forrestii,”“nervosa,” “cappa,” “pterocaula,” “eupatorioides,” “cuspidata,”“griffithii,” “latifolia,” “revoluta,” “simonsii,” “xiaoheiyao,”“caoweiling,” and “baimianfeng.” The collected data fromdifferent sources were comprehensively summarized for botany,ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, andtoxicology of the genus Duhaldea DC. ChemDraw 20.0 was usedto extract the chemical metabolites. The PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was used to confirm the chemicalclassifications and structures, and iPlant (https://www.iplant.cn/)was used to verify the names of the plants.2 Traditional uses andethnopharmacologyBotanical drugs have been used to treat an array of conditions byhumans since ancient days (Schulz et al., 2001). Duhaldea DCspecies are widely distributed in Asia. The botanical drug uses ofthe genus Duhaldea DC are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1 Summary of the ethnobotanical uses of the genus Duhaldea DC (species name, plant part, country, uses, mode of administration, and associatedreferences).Species Plant partusedUses ReferencesD.wissmannianRoot Infantile malnutritional stagnation Synopsis of Chinese Ethnic Medicine (in Chinese)D. nervosa Root or whole Treatment of rheumatic diseases such as rheumatic ostealgia,beriberi edema, and rheumatic arthritisTreatment of digestive system diseases such as dyspepsodynia,cacochylia, dyspepsia abdominal distension, chronic gastritis, andesophagus cancerTreating fractures and bone woundsTreatment of other diseases such as cold, sputum cough, ardentfever, pain in waist and lower extremities, neuralgia, and mammitisLong (2004), Dian Nan Ben Cao (in Chinese), Yunnan SelectedChinese Materia Medica (in Chinese), Yunnan Simao SelectedChinese Materia Medica (in Chinese), Synopsis of Chinese EthnicMedicine (in Chinese), and Compendium of Chinese TraditionalMedicine Resources (in Chinese)D. cappa Leaf, root, orwhole plantTreatment of a variety of painful diseases such as rheumatic pain inwaist and lower extremities, rheumatic ostealgia, toothache,dyspepsodynia, rheumatic arthralgia, and nervous headacheTreatment of multiple inflammatory conditions such as kidneyinflammation edema, infantile pneumonia, gastritis, vesical catarrh,amygdalitis, bronchitis, gingivitis, mammitis, and hepatitisTreatment of parasitic infectious diseases such as bilharziasis,malaria, and acariasisTreatment of other diseases injuries from falls, fractures, contusionsand strains, hemorrhage, cold cough, ardent fever, itchy skin,infantile fever, neuroticism, sore and furuncle, puerperal cold,irregular menses, tuberculosis, snakebite, diarrhea, postpartumcold, and hemorrhoidsYunnan Selected Chinese Materia Medica (in Chinese), YunnanSimao Selected Chinese Materia Medica (in Chinese), ChineseEthnic Materia Medica Monographs (in Chinese), Synopsis ofChinese Ethnic Medicine (in Chinese), and Compendium of ChineseTraditional Medicine ResourcesD. pterocaula Root Treatment of ulcerative carbuncle pyogenic infections, tracheitis,injuries from falls, fractures, contusions and strains, deficiency ofvital energy, dizziness, cough due to lung deficiency, dysentery,tinnitus, insomnia, fluster, splenic organ swelling, anemofrigid cold,dizziness, cold, and tuberculosis of bones and jointsChunli et al.

Large sesquiterpenoids were also recently identified inthe alcohol extract of D. wissmanniana (Cheng et al., 2013; Chenget al., 2014b). Other studies in subsequent years have led to theisolation and identification of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids,inositol angelates, phenolic metabolites, phenolic,monoterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes from acetone,chloroform, methanol, and ethanol extracts of D. cappa (Wanget al., 2012; Zhou, 2017). Moreover, a study on the chemicalmetabolites of the root of D. cappa resulted in the extractionand characterization of a mixture of five ceramide metabolitesfrom this species (Guo et al., 2007). In the past few decades, liquidchromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), especially ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution massspectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS), has become the most powerfuland reliable analytical instrument in the detection andcharacterization of metabolites from traditional Chinesemedicine, drug, or biological samples (Wei et al., 2020).UHPLC-HRMS is an advanced form of an analytical techniqueused to separate and identify the complex mixture of metabolitesfound in botanical drugs. It is important to make generalizationabout the fragmentation pathways of reference metabolites usingthe HRMS technique to speculate the identity of potentialmetabolites in genus Duhaldea DC. (Ma et al., 2022). In thestudy of the chemical composition of the whole botanical drugand inflorescence of D. nervosa, UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrapmass spectrometer and UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS were used, and149 chlorogenic acid derivatives and 34 metabolites were finallyidentified, respectively (Wei et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022). UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer and UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS were used in the study of the chemical composition ofD. cappa,and 68 chlorogenic acid derivatives and 12 metabolites were finallyidentified, respectively (Peng et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2021).3.2 Chemical compositionDetailed phytochemical studies on Duhaldea DC. have revealedin an array of secondary metabolites. Many researchers, especially inthe past 40 years, have discovered new metabolite structures fromDuhaldeaDC. To date, a total of 393 chemical metabolites have beenreported from Duhaldea DC. species, including sesquiterpenoids,monoterpenes, diterpene, triterpenes, inositol angelates,phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, phenolic metabolites, and ceramidemetabolites (Figure 1). The detailed information on thesemetabolites is summarized in Supplementary Table S1.3.2.1 MonoterpenesMonoterpenes belong to a large and diverse group of naturallyoccurring metabolites. The basic structure of monoterpenes, ormonoterpenoids, consists of two linked isoprene units. Theymight be cyclized and oxidized in a variety of ways. Due to theirFIGURE 1Chemical classes and proportions of phytochemical metabolites isolated and characterized from the genus Duhaldea DC.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963low molecular weight, many of them exist in the form of essentialoils. Many monoterpenes and their derivatives have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, analgesic, antiviral,anticancer, antituberculosis, and antioxidant biological activities(Zielińska Błajet and Feder Kubis, 2020). A total of20 monoterpenes (1–20) have been reported from the genusDuhaldea DC., and Figure 2 shows their chemical structures.3.2.2 SesquiterpenoidsIn the study of chemotaxonomy based on secondary metabolitesfrom the Asteraceae family, sesquiterpene lactones, which are usedas taxonomic markers, are a more studied class of secondarymetabolites. More than 4,000 sesquiterpene lactones with around30 different skeletons have been reported from several tribes ofAsteraceae (Wu et al., 2006). A total of 90 sesquiterpenoids (21–110)have been reported from the genus Duhaldea DC., and Figure 3shows their chemical structures.3.2.3 DiterpenesDiterpenes are the product of the mevalonic acid biosynthesispathway. Some diterpenes have antiviral activity, such as kirkinine,Excoecaria toxin (anti-HIV), jiadifenoic acids JP (anti-Coxsackievirus), briaexcavatolide U, briaexcavatin L (anti-HCMV),genkwanin P, laurifolioside A (anti-HBV), linearol, isosidol (anti-HPIV-2), and debromoaplysiatoxin (anti-CHIKV) (Wardana et al.,2021). A total of nine diterpenes (111–119) have been reported fromthe genus Duhaldea DC., and their chemical structures are shownin Figure 4.3.2.4 TriterpenesTriterpenoids are a class of terpenoids with a basic skeletonof 30 carbon atoms consisting of six isoprene units, which existin the plant body in free form or in the form of glycosides oresters combined with sugars, and have a wide range ofbiochemical activities, such as anti-inflammatory andantitumorigenic activities (Gill et al., 2016; Miranda et al.,2022). At the same time, triterpenes play a vital role in theformation of structures in plant membranes, which stabilize thephospholipid bilayers in the cell membranes (Liby et al., 2007). Atotal of 25 triterpenoids (120–144) have been reported from thegenus Duhaldea DC., and their chemical structures are shownin Figure 5.FIGURE 2Structures of monoterpenes (metabolites 1–20).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.14799633.2.5 Inositol angelatesInositol, also known as cyclohexane hexanol, is widelydistributed in animals and plants and is a growth factor foranimals and microorganisms. It was first isolated from the heartmuscle and liver. Muscle inositol is an essential nutrient source forbirds and mammals, and a deficiency of muscle inositol can, forexample, cause symptoms such as hair loss in mice and periocularabnormalities in rats. Furthermore, inositol deficiency may beinvolved in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as metabolicsyndrome, spina bifida (a neural tube defect), polycystic ovarysyndrome, and diabetes (Marine and Christophe, 2013; Kianiet al., 2021; Dorina et al., 2023). A total of 19 inositol angelates(145–163) have been reported from the genus Duhaldea DC., andtheir chemical structures are shown in Figure 6.3.2.6 PhenylpropanoidsPhenylpropanoids form a class of metabolites with a corestructure consisting of a phenyl group attached to a three-carbonFIGURE 3Structures of sesquiterpenoids (metabolites 21–110).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963chain. This C6–C3 carbon skeleton is usually obtained from theenzymatic deamination of the aromatic amino acidphenylalanine. Phenylpropanoids, owing to their antimicrobialand antioxidant activities, are applied in pharmaceuticalproducts as a preservative. Currently, in many countries,phenylpropanoid derivatives have been approved as foodadditives and active metabolites in skincare products (Neelamet al., 2020). A total of 39 phenylpropanoids (164–202) have beenreported from the genus Duhaldea DC., and their chemicalstructures are shown in Figure 7.3.2.7 FlavonoidsFlavonoids are a group of polyphenolic metabolites producedin plants as secondary metabolites. Flavonoids are a class ofyellow pigments derived from 2-phenylchromanone as themother nucleus, including the isomers of flavonoids and theirhydrogenation and reduction products, i.e., a series ofmetabolites with C6-C3-C6 as the basic carbon framework.Flavonoids are widely found in fruits, vegetables, and otherfood crops. They have favorable biochemical effects onmultiple diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease andatherosclerosis), as well as other bioactivities (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities) (Serafiniet al., 2010; Fardoun et al., 2020; Badshah et al., 2021; Shenet al., 2022). A total of 61 flavonoids (203–263) have beenreported from the genus Duhaldea DC., and their chemicalstructures are shown in Figure 8.3.2.8 SteroidsSteroid is a general term for a large group of cyclopentane-thickened fully hydrogenated phenanthrene derivatives that arewidely distributed in living organisms. Steroids are widelyknown for their potent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating activities (Neilsen et al., 2014). A total of22 steroids (264–285) have been isolated from the genusDuhaldea DC., and their chemical structures are shownin Figure 9.3.2.9 Fatty acidsFatty acids are carboxylic acids with a typical RCOOHstructure, containing a methyl end, a hydrocarbon chain (R),and a carboxylic terminus. Fatty acids have both a systematicand a common name (e.g., octadecanoic and stearic). Fattyacids play multiple roles in humans and other organisms. At thesame time, fatty acids are a substantial part of lipids, one of thethree major metabolites of biological matter (along withproteins and carbohydrates) (Tvrzicka et al., 2011). A totalof 11 fatty acids (286–296) have been reported from the genusDuhaldea DC., and their chemical structures are shownin Figure 10.3.2.10 Other metabolitesIn addition to the above metabolites, Duhaldea DC. alsocontains phenolic acids, chlorogenic acid, organic acids, andpolyols. These metabolites are categorized as other becausethey rarely exert similar pharmacological effects as a class ofmetabolites or they occur less frequently in the genus. Forexample, Wang et al. isolated and purified a novel water-soluble polysaccharide (DNP-1) from the root of D. nervosavia column chromatography (Wang et al., 2023). This is theonly isolation of polysaccharides that we have found in ourresearch searches of this genus. A total of 56 other metabolites(297–352) have been reported from the genus Duhaldea DC., andtheir chemical structures are shown in Figure 11.FIGURE 4Structures of diterpenes (metabolites 111–119).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.14799634 PharmacologyPresent-day research and the study of historical texts haveshown that whole plants or their respective plant parts havebeen used to treat or alleviate different illnesses. Currently,botanical drugs are also used in the conventional system ofmedicine, where plants and associated phytochemicals arebeing actively explored for their direct use aspharmaceutical agents. At the same time, it can be notedthat the plant is used as a medicine and food, is usuallyFIGURE 5Structures of triterpenes (metabolites 120–124).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963used as a spice and seasoning in food, and also prevents andcontrols some diseases in people.The genus Duhaldea DC. has long been used therapeutically indifferent countries in Asia due to its wide range of biological andpharmacological activities. The broad-spectrum ethnomedicinaluses of the different species of Duhaldea DC. have led to theinitiation of several pharmacological investigations, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and antibacterial activities. Abrief summary of these pharmacological effects is given in Figure 12.An overview of the modern pharmacological studies on these speciesis detailed in the following sections.4.1 Anti-inflammatory activityInflammation is a defensive response of the body to stimulation,manifested by redness, swelling, heat, pain, and dysfunction. Inimmune cells, macrophages are the main cell type involved in theinflammatory process. RAW 264.7 macrophages are a good modelfor screening anti-inflammatory drugs. The modern pharmacologyof Duhaldea DC has proven to have significant anti-inflammatoryeffects, and its main material basis of anti-inflammation issesquiterpenoids. A total of 21 eudesmane and germacranederivatives were isolated from D. wissmannian. These isolatesexhibited significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 macrophages (20, 5, 0.5, and 0.1 µM), withaminoguanidine as a positive control (Cheng et al., 2013; Chenget al., 2014b). Wang et al. screened a total of 35 monomers isolatedfrom D. wissmannian, including sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenes,and flavonoid lignans, for their inhibitory effects on NOmetabolismin LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Four concentrationgradients of 50, 10, 2, and 0.4 µM were used to determine themetabolic inhibition rate and cytotoxicity of each monomermetabolite on NO, and 1β-hydroxy-alantolactone and inulicinwere used as a positive control. The results showed that thesesquiterpenoids containing α-methylene-γ-lactone fragmentsexhibited strong NO metabolism inhibition, and some flavonoidlignans and myo-inositol derivatives also showed some anti-inflammatory activities (Wang, 2013). The D. wissmannianeudesmane-derivatized sesquiterpene, Chengwissmanolide A(IC50 = 0.38 μM), showed stronger or similar NO inhibitoryactivity to the positive drug aminoguanidine (0.20 or 0.37 μM)(Cheng, 2012). Four new sesquiterpenes, pterocaullins A−D (1–4),along with 10 known metabolites isolated from the whole plants ofD. pterocaula, were tested for their inhibitory effects against LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages usingparthenolide (10 μM) as a positive control. Pterocaullin Bexhibited promising anti-inflammatory activity, with an IC50value of 7.03 µM (Zhu et al., 2019).FIGURE 6Structures of inositol angelates (metabolites 145–163).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963Other types of metabolites in the genus also have good anti-inflammatory activity. A new polysaccharide, DNP-1, was isolatedfrom D. nervosa and inhibited the concentrations of NO, TNF-α,MCP-1, IL-2, and IL-6 pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-inducedRAW 264.7 cells at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 μg/mL (Wanget al., 2023). Wang et al. isolated 17 metabolites from D.wissmannian, and the anti-inflammatory activity of RAW264.7 macrophages against LPS-induced NO production was alsoFIGURE 7Structures of phenylpropanoids (metabolites 164–202).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963evaluated. Metabolites 3-acetate-1,2,4,5-tetrakis(2-methyl-2-butenoate) inositol, 2,3-dehydrosilychristin, hydnocarpin, 8-hydroxy-7,9-di-isobutyryloxythymol, and 7-hydroxy-8,9-bis(isobutyryloxy)thymol showed moderate activities, with IC50values of 13.3, 19.6, 23.3, 10.8, and 10.1 μM, respectively. On theother hand, 4-acetate-1,2,3,5-tetrakis (2-methyl-2-butenoate)inositol, 23-o-acetylsilychristin A, isohydnocarpin, silybin B, andisosilybin A exhibited weak activities, with IC50 values of 32.6, 36.7,48.2, 50.5, and 50.5 μM, respectively (Wang et al., 2013).The metabolite (4R,5R,6S,7S,9S,10R)-9-angeloyloxy-4,5-epoxygermacra-11 (13)-en-12,6-olide, isolated from D.wissmannian, demonstrated potent inhibition of NO with anIC50 value of 1.04 ± 0.07 μM. Aminoguanidine served as thepositive control and exhibited its inhibition with an IC50 value of0.79 ± 0.05 μM (Cheng et al., 2014b). Maoxiucaioside A obtainedfrom D. nervosa. has a significant inhibitory effect on the release ofTNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, with IC50 values of 17.90 ± 2.29 μM, 19.45 ±2.16 μM, and 18.54 ± 1.30 μM, respectively, slightly lower than thoseof dexamethasone (Li et al., 2023). The metabolites derived from D.nervosa, i.e., nervolan A, nervolan B, nervolan C, coniferyldiangelate, and sinapyl diangelate, were evaluated for theirinhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells. The results demonstrated that these metabolitesexhibited mild inhibitory activities against NO production, withIC50 values of 33.31, 15.43, 21.32, 16.19, and 33.56 μM, respectively(Yan et al., 2010). The five known analogs, isolated from D. cappa,exhibited anti-inflammatory activities against the production of NOin RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. Their IC50 values rangedfrom 7 to 23 μM, with celecoxib (IC50 1.6 μM) serving as the positivecontrol (Wu et al., 2015).The D. cappa methanolic extract (75 and 150 mg/kg) showedreduction in the rat paw edema, significant inhibition of the cottonpellet-induced granulomas in rats, and potentialimmunomodulatory activity in all the assays performed (JyotiFIGURE 8Structures of flavonoids (metabolites 203–263).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963et al., 2017). The D. cappa root ethanol extract (5 g/kg) significantlyinhibited xylene-induced ear swelling and acetic acid-inducedcapillary permeability in mice and has certain anti-inflammatoryeffects (Mo et al., 2012), and 60% ethanol fraction of D. cappa is themain anti-inflammatory constituent (Gong et al., 2018; Wang et al.,2018). The D. cappa aqueous extract (24 g/kg) also improved theinflammatory response of severe pneumonia rats, which may berelated to the inhibition of the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signalingpathway (Aizaizi et al., 2018). The D. cappa aqueous extract(24 g/kg) can improve inflammation of severe pneumoniainduced by Klebsiella pneumoniae by blocking p38 MAPK andNF-κBp65 signaling pathways (Li, 2017).FIGURE 9Structures of steroids (metabolites 264–285).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.14799634.2 Antitumor activityTumors are formed by the proliferation of local tissue cells under theaction of various tumorigenic factors. According to the cellcharacteristics of tumors and the degree of harm to the body, tumorsare divided into benign tumors and malignant tumors. Cancer, amalignant tumor, has become the second leading fatal disease aftercardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and seriously threatenshuman health and life. Modern pharmacological studies have shownthatDuhaldeaDC. has certain anticancer effects, and its main anticancersubstance is sesquiterpenoids. Cheng et al. evaluated all 21 isolates; theseisolates showed no significant toxicity in RAW 264.7 macrophages atconcentrations up to 20 μM. Metabolites (5R,7R,10S)-4,5-epoxy-4,5-secoeudesma-1,3-dien-12,5-olide, 3-oxoeudesma-1,4,11 (13)-trien-12,6β-olide, haageanolide, and 11,13-dehydroisohyposantonin hadstrong inhibitory effects on NO, with IC50 values of 0.68, 0.68, 0.97,and 0.65 μM, respectively. Moreover, the cytotoxicity assay in fourhuman tumor cell lines suggested that new metabolites (5R,7R,10S)-4,5-epoxy-4,5-secoeudesma-1,3-dien-12,5-olide, (2R,4E,6R,7S,9S,10R)-2-acetoxy-9-angeloyloxygermacra-4,11(13)-dien-12,6-olide, 4E-9β-angeloyloxy-2α-hydroxy-7α,10αH-germacra-4,11(13)-dien-12,6α-olide(4E,6R,7S,9S,10R)-9-angeloyloxygermacra-4,11 (13)-dien-12,6-olide,4E-9β-methacryloxy-7α,10αH-germacra-4,11 (13)-dien-12,6α-olide,4E-9β-hydroxy-7α,10αH-germacra-4,11 (13)-dien-12,6α-olide, and 3-oxoeudesma-1,4,11 (13)-trien-12,6β-olide showed strong toxicityagainst HepG2, PC-3, and MGC-803 cells (Cheng et al., 2013). Fivegermacrane-type sesquiterpene lactones (ineupatolide D, ineupatolide E,dvaricin B, nepalolide C, and inculacappolide) were isolated from D.cappa showed moderate inhibitory effects on A431, A549, BGC-823,HL-60, HT-29, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines with IC50 values rangingfrom 2.1 to 36.3 µM, and doxorubicin was used as the positive control(Wu et al., 2017). The cytotoxicity assay showed that inulacappolide hasanti-proliferative effects against human cervical cancer (HeLa), humanleukemia (K562), and human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cell lines,with IC50 values of 1.2 mM, 3.8 mM, and 5.3 µM, respectively (Xie et al.,2007). The sesquiterpene metabolite ineupatorolide B, isolated from D.cappa, exhibited potent growth-inhibitory activity against HeLa cells,whereas its activity against MM1-CB melanoma cells was weaker. Themechanism by which ineupatorolide B exerts its growth-inhibitoryeffects may involve the activation of PKCα, leading to anenhancement of the retrotranscriptional activation capacity of NFAT(Mei et al., 2015).As a medicinal plant, this genus not only serves as a flavorfulseasoning but also inhibits the production of carcinogens in food.Cheng et al. discovered that the electrophilic metabolites act ascreatinine inhibitors to reduce the generation of heterocyclicaromatic amines. Their research reveals that the rhizome of D.nervosa, when used as a spice, can inhibit the production ofcarcinogens in food (Cheng et al., 2023). D. nervosa shows greaterpotential as a functional food for cancer prevention and anticancereffects. Under the condition of simulated gastric fluid in vitro, the stemand leaf extracts of D. nervosa can effectively remove nitrite and blockthe production of nitrosamines (Yuan et al., 2021).4.3 Antioxidant activityAn increasing body of research indicates that antioxidants play acrucial role in mitigating the effects of aging as free radicals and oxidantscontribute to cellular and tissue degradation, impair metabolic functions,FIGURE 10Structures of fatty acids (metabolites 286–296).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963and are associated with various health issues. Cheng et al. compared thechemical space and antioxidant activities of ethanol extracts fromdifferentparts of D. nervosa. Findings support the traditional use of its roots andindicate thymol di-isobutyrate as a major functional factor. The resultsshowed that significant correlations and extracts upregulated the mRNAexpression of antioxidant response actors in H2O2-challengedHepG2 cells, hence also cueing the potential antioxidant activity ofother parts (Cheng et al., 2020). He et al. compared the antioxidanteffects of ultrasonic alcoholic extracts from different parts of the plantthrough in vivo and ex vivo experiments. In vitro, the extract amount waspositively correlated with the clearing effect of free radicals at certain drugconcentrations, with VC as the positive drug. In vivo, control and agingmodel groups had different treatments, while the experimental group hadlow, medium, and high (300, 600, and 1,200 μg g−1·d−1)-dose intragastricadministrations. The results showed good free radical scavenging andantioxidant capacity, with the underground part having a significantlyhigher antioxidant effect than the abovegroundpart (He et al., 2016). Yanget al. investigated the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from above-ground and below-ground parts of D. nervosa and total flavonoid of D.nervosa and found that the reducing ability of polysaccharide andflavonoid, the inhibiting ability of superoxide anion free radical, andthe scavenging ability of the DPPH radical were greater than that of para-rutin at high concentration, and the antioxidant ability was higher thanthat of rutin with the increase in concentration. They show a highscavenging rate of hydroxyl radicals (Tao et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2016).Kalola et al. used the DPPH radical scavenging assay, superoxide radicalscavenging assay, measurement of reducing power, and measurement ofthe effect on lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenates, and butylatedhydroxytoluene, gallic acid, and ascorbic acid were used as the positivecontrol. The results showed that the D. cappamethanolic extract and theFIGURE 11Structures of other metabolites (metabolites 297–352).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963ethyl acetate-soluble fraction exhibited higher antioxidant activity (Kalolaand Shah, 2006). The volatile oil (310–520 mg/L) of D. cappa has somescavenging ability for both hydroxyl radicals (positive control: mannitoland thiourea) and superoxide anion radicals (positive control: VC), butthe scavenging activity of hydroxyl radicals is stronger (Liu et al., 2009a).D. nervosa extracts (0.05 g/g) can also effectively inhibit the oxidation ofoils (Liu et al., 2011).4.4 Antibacterial activityAntimicrobial activity is an important indicator for screeningnatural metabolites for their potential to become antibiotics. Ethanolextracts (10 μg/mL) and petroleum ether extracts (10 μg/mL) of D.nervosa significantly inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillussubtilis (Liu et al., 2011). The essential oil derived from D. cappacomprises approximately 50% sesquiterpene hydrocarbons.Streptomycin (30 μg/disk) and erythromycin (15 μg/disk) were usedas positive controls, while hexane was taken as a negative control, and atthe concentration of 1,000 μL/mL, it has a significant inhibitory effecton Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Xanthomonasviripennis, and B. subtilis (Priydarshi et al., 2016). The antimicrobialactivity of the flavonoid extracts fromD. cappawas studied against ninemicroorganisms. The results showed that the minimal inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) of the D. cappa flavonoids to Sarcina lutea wasthe best with a ratio of 0.0039 g/mL; the MIC of E. faecalis, B. subtilis,FIGURE 12Brief description of the various pharmacological actions of the genus Duhaldea DC.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963and S. aureus was 0.1250 g/mL; the MIC of Escherichia coli, Salmonellatyphimurium, and Salmonella paratyphi A was 0.5000 g/mL but noobvious inhibitory effect on Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans (LiuW. et al., 2010). Liu et al. showed that the MIC values of roots, stems,and leaves against S. aureus were 15.63, 62.5, and 62.5 mg/mL,respectively, while the MIC values of roots, stems, and leaves againstPseudomonas aeruginosa were 15.63, 31.25, and 62.5 mg/mL,respectively (Liu et al., 2009b). The antimicrobial effects of differentextracts from different parts of D. cappa on different bacteria werecompared, among which the glacial acetic acid extract had the bestantimicrobial effect, the root and leaf extracts had better antimicrobialeffects than the stem extract, and the extracts had better inhibitoryeffects on Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria (Liu S. et al.,2010). The growth of 15 plant pathogenic fungi and 4 bacteria could beinhibited by 100 mg/mL of thymol isolated from D. cappa (Xie et al.,2012). By comparing the various extraction and separation fractions ofthe ethanol extract of D. cappa, the chloroform:acetone 10:0 fraction ofthe ethyl acetate extract exhibited the most significant antibacterialactivity at a concentration of 2.0 mg/mL, followed by the ethyl acetateextract and the chloroform:acetone 9:1 fraction (Li et al., 2020).4.5 Others’ activityThe electrophilic metabolites (0.5, 2.0, and 8.0 μg/mL) ofD. nervosaattenuated hepatic steatosis in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. Studies suggestthat it improved hepatic lipid metabolism disorder, Krebs cycle activity,oxidative phosphorylation, and the cellular and mitochondrial redoxstatus. Additionally, 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrateactivates the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway by upregulatingNrf2 expression and promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation (Chenget al., 2022). Dong et al. found that the ethyl acetate fraction of D.nervosa (0.5–2.0 μg/mL) effectively reduced hepatic lipid accumulationand ROS production, lowered TG and TC levels, and enhancedantioxidant enzyme activity. The depletion of electrophiliccomponents reduced its efficacy and regulatory effects on lipidmetabolism and redox-related gene expression (Dong et al., 2020).The ethyl acetate fraction of D. pterocaula (40 mg/kg, 100 μL)demonstrated potent analgesic effects in inflammatory pain mousemodels and caused no anti-nociceptive tolerance (Huang et al.,2021b). The alcoholic extract of the D. cappa root (5 g/kg)significantly inhibited the pain response induced by the hot platemethod and the twisting method in mice and had some analgesiceffects (Mo et al., 2012). Kiran et al. and Yupei et al. developed ahepatotoxicity model through the intraperitoneal injection of carbontetrachloride suspended in sterile oil or D-GalN. Silymarin at a dosage of100 mg/kg and bifendate at 0.2 g/kg were identified as positive controldrugs. The dosages for the water extract ofD. cappawere administered at9.8 g/kg, 19.5 g/kg, and 39.0 g/kg and 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg, and theeffects on hepatotoxicity were assessed after a 10-day treatment period.The aqueous extract of D. cappa chrysanthemum showed ahepatoprotective effect against carbon CCl4 and D-GalN-inducedhepatotoxicity in rats (Kiran et al., 2017; He et al., 2019). Yang et al.screened a PXR-HepG2 cell model with high expression of the pregnaneX receptor. A negative control group (DMSO group, 0.1%), a drugtreatment group (25, 50, and 100 mg/L), and a positive control groupwere treatedwith the pregnane X receptor agonist rifampicin (10 μmol/L)for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Yang et al. showed that D. cappa canaffect the expression of P450 enzymes in primary rat hepatocytes andHepG2 cells with high expression of the pregnane X receptor (Changet al., 2020).The methanol and dichloromethane extracts ofD. cappa are potentinhibitors of herpes simplex virus infection in vitro. The D. cappamethanol extract exhibited significantly higher anti-herpes simplexvirus (HSV) activity than the D. cappa dichloromethane extract as itinhibited more than 50% of the virus. The 50% effective doses of the D.cappamethanol extract against HSV-1 and HSV-2 were determined tobe 720.1 ± 32.7 μg/mL and 529.2 ± 5.2 μg/mL, respectively (Nikomtatet al., 2011). The 12 isolated triterpenoids were screened for their anti-osteoporotic activities, and the metabolites oleanoic acid 3-O-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester and 2β-hydroxyolean-3-O-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-12-en-23, 28-dioic acid showed goodanti-osteoporotic activities with IC50 values of 86.3 and 51.6 μg/mL,respectively, and their inhibitory effects were slightly lower than those ofthe positive control, teriparatide (45.6 μg/mL) (Tai et al., 2014). Fujitaet al. studied the mechanism of action of 5–15 µM inulavosin isolatedfrom D. nervosa (Compositae) in inhibiting melanogenesis, reducingthe melanin content without affecting the enzymatic activities or thetranscription of tyrosinase or Tyrp1 in B16 melanoma cells (Hideakiet al., 2009). Wen et al. evaluated the anti-complementary effects ofblossoms of D. nervosa extracts based on the classical pathway. Theirresults showed that chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and thymol were the major anti-complementarymetabolites in the blossoms of D. nervosa (Wen et al., 2019).5 Conclusion and future perspectivesThe genus Duhaldea DC. has been used in traditional medicine totreat fractures, bone wounds, carbuncle and poison, bronchitis, bruises,giddy with hypertension of qi, and lung deficiency cough. Five species ofthe genusDuhaldeaDC. have been reported to have various applicationsin traditional systems of medicine in several Asian countries. However,ethnobotanical data are sometimes hard to find, and it is difficult toaccess sources. Therefore, although the authors have made great effortsto cover the available literature as rigorously as possible, there may bepossibilities that some publications, reports, or books on traditionalmedicinal uses of the genus Duhaldea DC. escaped our exploration.Available data indicate that over 352 metabolites have been identifiedfrom this genus, including terpenoids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids,inositol angelates, chalcones, phenolics, and ceramide metabolites. Thegenus Duhaldea DC. is associated with various pharmacologicalactivities, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-osteoporotic, anticancer, and antioxidant activities. Despite the fruitfulphytochemical and pharmacological studies on genus Duhaldea DC.,there are still several key issues to be resolved regarding the need forfurther development of genus Duhaldea DC.At present, the genus Duhaldea DC. comprises 15 specieswidespread in Central, East, and Southeast Asia. However, onlythree (D. wissmannian,D. nervosa, andD. cappa) of the plants in thegenus have been more extensively studied. In the future, moreattention needs to be paid to underexplored plants in the studyof this genus; these underexplored plant species could be promisingcandidates for further research.Regrettably, aside from the systematic characterization andseparation of plant metabolites conducted by Wang and ChengFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Shu et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1479963et al. on D. wissmannian (Cheng, 2012; Wang, 2013), most otherphytochemical investigations related to this species remain relativelyfragmented. Phytochemistry seeks to identify valuable new plantmetabolites. There exist considerable gaps in the study of thechemistry within this genus, making the systematiccharacterization and separation of its metabolites an urgentpriority. Simultaneously, plant metabolites encompass not onlyvarious small-molecule metabolites but also macromolecularmetabolites such as polysaccharides and peptides, which exhibitremarkable pharmacological activities. However, it is dishearteningto note that among the extensive studies conducted on this genus,only Wang et al. realized this aspect (Wang et al., 2023).Although advancements have been achieved in understandingthe chemical and pharmacological characteristics of the genusDuhaldea DC., several concerns remain. Notably, the majority ofpharmacological investigations on plant metabolites have beenconducted exclusively in vitro, leading to a low confidence levelregarding the validity of such simplistic in vitro studiesdemonstrating activity. Likewise, certain pharmacologicalassessments of extracts from this genus have only confirmedtheir efficacy in vitro. The current study mainly focused on thepharmacological activity profile of the extracts and isolatedmetabolites of the genus Duhaldea DC, while the mechanism ofaction was less studied, and targets and channels of action of theactive metabolites corresponding to diseases were not scientificallyelucidated. Modern scholars can consider using networkpharmacology, data mining, and virtual screening to predict thetargets, receptors, and pathways of their chemical metabolitesrelated to pharmacological activities. At the same time, themolecular mechanisms and relationships between the activemetabolites of the genus and the potential pharmacologicalactivities are validated through high-quality and well-designed invivo and in vitro and clinical studies.In terms of pharmacological effects, most of them have focusedon the anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, and other effects,but at present, there are few modern pharmacological studies of thetraditional effects of FI in the treatment of diseases. These ignore themodern pharmacological interpretation of traditional applications.In the future, pharmacologic studies of the genus Duhaldea DC canfocus on indications in its traditional applications and should alsoprovide a modern pharmacological explanation for the traditionalapplication of the genus Duhaldea DC. At the same time, it shouldbe noted that the plants of the genus Duhaldea DC are used as bothmedicine and food, and the pharmacological effects of theapplication in food and the effect on the inhibition of somedisease-causing factors in food, as well as the prevention andcontrol of some diseases.Finally, Duhaldea DC species possess various biologicalactivities, which can be applied to clinical medicine with furtherresearch. In addition, with the advancements observed recently inanalytical techniques and quality control methods, among which theimprovement and update in chromatography techniques andmolecular identification methods, it is inevitable that new qualitymarkers and quality control measures may be adopted for the betterquality assessment of traditional botanical drug medicine inthe future.Plants of the genusDuhaldeaDC as traditional plant medicineshave made outstanding contributions in treating diseases andmaintaining physical health. In this study, theethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacologicaleffects of the genus Duhaldea DC were systematicallyelaborated to obtain a comprehensive understanding of thegenus Duhaldea DC and reveal the shortcomings of the currentresearch studies. In response to these shortcomings, this studyprovides guidance for future research on the genus Duhaldea DC,providing an effective scientific basis for expanding thepharmacological effect of Duhaldea DC, explaining thetraditional application of Duhaldea DC, developing new drugsrationally, ensuring drug safety, controlling drug quality, andadapting Duhaldea DC to clinical application.Author contributionsLS: conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis,investigation, methodology, resources, software, validation, andwriting–original draft.
