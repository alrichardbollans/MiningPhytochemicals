Elgorashi1,2AbstractProfessor Johannes van Staden, Director of the Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development-University of KwaZulu Natal, conducts research in the field of plant physiology, biotechnology, and ethnomedicine. The research span over a wide range of plant families growing in the southern African region. The plant family Amaryllidaceae, known for its ornamental and pharmaco-logical values, received much attention by his research group. This review covers research conducted by his group on the chemistry of some members of Amaryllidaceae and biological activities of their constituents.KeywordsAmaryllidaceae, chemistry, biological activity, alkaloidsReceived: March 11th, 2019; Accepted: June 10th, 2019.Members of  the family Amaryllidaceae J. St.-Hil. are mostly bul-bous perennial or biennial plants that are widely distributed in the tropics and the warm parts of  the temperate regions of  the world. They are richly represented in the southern African region and to a lesser extent in the Andean South America and the Mediterranean.1,2 The family comprises about 1000 species belonging to 60 genera of  which an estimated 300 species in 20 genera are of  African origin.3,4 The Amaryllidaceae plants cen-tered in the southern African region belong mostly to 3 major tribes namely Haemantheae Pax (Hutchinson), Cyrthantheae Salisb., and Amaryllideae J. St.-Hil., although some members of  the latter have a pantropical distribution, eg, Crinum.4,5 The most African tribe Amaryllideae is divided into 2 subtribes: the subtribe Crininae comprising Boophone Herb., Crinum L., Ammocharis Herb., and Cybistetes Milne-Redh. & Schweick, while the subtribe Amaryllidinae comprising Amaryllis L., Nerine Herb., Brunsvigia Heist., Crossyne Salisb., Hessea Herb., Strumaria Jacq., and Carpolyza Salisb.2,6Members of  the family Amaryllidaceae are known for their ornamental and horticultural value. Many varieties are cultivated for their ornamental appeal including those of  Narcissus L. in Europe,7 Hippeastrum Herb. in South America and the Indian sub-continent,8 others are wild sourced ornamental bulbs such as the genus Galanthus L.9 Species belonging to Amaryllidaceae have also been used in traditional medicine by indigenous people through-out the world to cure ailments and diseases.2,10,11 Literature reports suggest widespread use of  Amaryllidaceae by different eth-nic groups in South Africa such as Khoi-San, Sotho, Tswana, Xhosa, and Zulu.10 This is due to the fact that traditional medi-cine forms an integral part of  southern African culture.2 Included among various ailments and diseases are stomach ailments, skin diseases, headaches, dizziness, wounds, chest and bladder pain, renal and liver complaints, infertility, aching joints, rheumatism, snake bites, facilitation of  child birth during labor, hysteria, and as narcotics.12-15The rationale behind the use of  Amaryllidaceae in traditional medicine and their medicinal efficacy is attributed largely to the presence of  a unique type of  alkaloids. The alkaloids are pres-ent exclusively in this family and isolated from each member of  Amaryllidaceae investigated so far. These alkaloids are structur-ally related due to their biogenesis from the common precursor norbelladine 1. These alkaloids have been classified into dis-tinct ring types namely crinine 2, lycorine 3, galanthamine 4, tazettine 5, homolycorine 6, and montanine 7 ring types.2,16,17The use of  the amaryllidacious plants in both the ornamen-tal industry and the traditional medicine formed the basis for Natural Product Communications2the research activities conducted by Professor van Staden’s group. Their ornamental value is the driving force for research in plant physiology, mainly tissue culture and micropropaga-tion as well as plant growth regulators. Research on pharmaco-logical activities and phytochemical screening has been conducted to establish the rational usage of  these plants in tra-ditional medicine and the molecules behind their activity. This review will highlight research conducted by the group on the chemistry and biological activities of  species belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae from 1990 to 2018.The study of  Amaryllidaceae alkaloids began in the late 1990s with the investigation of  the alkaloidal content of  Crinum bul-bispermum.18 Since then, 36 alkaloids have been isolated from 9 species belonging to 4 genera endemic to South Africa. The structures of  these alkaloids span over 3 main ring types namely crinine 2, lycorine 3, and tazettine 5. Other ring type such as cherylline 8 was also found in some of  these species. A list of  trivial names of  these alkaloids, their distribution, bio-logical activities, and source is given in Table 1. Although most of  the listed alkaloids are known compounds, of  particular interest is the isolation of  8α-ethoxy precriwelline 9, N-desmethyl 8α-ethoxy pretazettine 10, and N-desmethyl-8β-ethoxy pretazettine 11 for the first time from C. bulbispermum.18 The compounds are characterized by the presence of  an ethoxy group at position 8 of  the tazettine type ring.It is worth mentioning that the compounds were extracted using hot ethanol and it is possible that these compounds are artifacts of  the extraction process. Extraction of  hemiacetals with methanol leads to methylation and it is likely the same that has happened here with ethanol.38Two new alkaloids were isolated from Crinum moorei namely mooreine 12 and 3-[4′-(8′-aminoethyl)phenoxy] bul-bispermine 13.28 Of  particular interest is the isolation of  dis-tichaminol 14, a derivative of  distichamine 15 an alkaloid only isolated from the genus Boophone, from Boophone haeman-thoides23 and the isocarbostyril narciprimine 16 isolated from the endemic southern African Cyrtanthus contractus. Narciprimine 16 has been only isolated from Zephyranthes, Narcissus, and Lycoris genera, endemic to America, Europe, and Asia, respectively.30 Some of  the findings included isola-tion and detection of  various nonalkaloidal compounds. Tyramine 17 which is one of  the components for the biosyn-thesis of  norbelladine 1, a precursor for Amaryllidaceae alka-loids, was isolated from Crinum macowanii27; isogeunitol 18, isoeugenitol glycoside 19, and 9Z-octadec-9-enamide 20 from Gethyllis ciliaris.36 Moreover, hydroxybenzoates, hydroxy-cinnamates, and flavonoids were identified in Cryptostephanus vansonii4 and Scadoxus puniceus37 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).It is well established that alkaloid production and distribu-tion vary with time of  the year and the developmental stage of  the plant. In many instances, the site of  biosynthesis may differ from the site of  accumulation.17 Therefore, a number of  studies on ontogenic variations of  Amaryllidaceae alkaloids have also been conducted on some of  the South African members of  the family.38–40 In a study investigating the seasonal and plant parts variation of  C. macowanii over 2 consecutive years, bulbs were found to have high alkaloid content compared to leaves, roots, and flowering stalks. Crinine 2 and lycorine 3 were the major alkaloids detected in C. macowanii. Bulbs con-tained the highest concentrations of  crinine 2 and lycorine 3 and only traces of  cherylline 8, crinamidine 22, and 1-epide-acetylbowdenisine 23. Crinine 2 was the only alkaloid detected in the leaf, while the root is the major source of  crinamine 24. No trend was observed in the seasonal variation of  these alka-loids. For instance, bulbs had the highest crinine 2 levels during winter followed by spring. In the roots, the crinine 2 content was high in spring in the first year of  study; however, in the second year, the lowest level was detected in spring. The same applies to the seasonal levels of  other alkaloids including crin-amidine 22 and 1-epideacetylbowdensine 23. The inconsis-tency in alkaloid variation on annual basis is a reflection of  the heterogeneity of  the population sampled. Investigations on the cytology of  C. macowanii revealed variation in the chromosome number. Chromosome numbers of  2n = 72, 2n = 44, and 2n = 30 were reported for plants of  C. macowanii.41The same pattern of  variation was observed in alkaloid content of  C. moorei between different plant parts, seasons of  the year, and even consecutive years. For instance, the highest concentration of  alkaloid was found in the leaves followed by the flowering stalks. Alkaloids possessing the ethano bridge in a β-position and lacking a double bond between positions 1 and 2 such as crinamidine 22, undula-tine 26, and 1-epideacetylbowdenisine 23 were found in the leaves and flowering stalks. Lycorine 3 and 1-O-acetyllycorine 28 were found in higher concentrations in the roots. Crinine 2 and its derivatives buphanisine 45 and powelline 27 were found in higher concentrations in the bulb.40 Seasonal and year-to-year variations in alkaloid content of  C. moorei were also observed. Bulbs had the highest levels of  lycorine 3, crinine 2, and undulatine 26 in winter during the first year of  the study, while bulbs had the highest concentrations of  lycorine 3 and crinine 2 in summer and had the lowest concentration of  undulatine 26 in winter.40 The high variability of  alkaloid content in these species was due to high variation among plants of  the same species collected in the same season. This vari-ability is attributed to the fact that most members of  the family Amaryllidaceae are self-sterile and seeds are seldom produced after self-fertilization.42Variations in other nonalkaloidal constituents were also investigated. Different plant parts of  C. vansonii were found to contain different levels of  hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxy-cinammates, and flavonoids. For instance, the flavo-noids naringenin and genistein were identified in at least 1 plant part (leaf, basal leaf, rhizome, and root). Similar results Elgorashi 3Table 1.

However, in-depth studies on interspecific variations in Amaryllidaceae alkaloids are rare.43 A study was conducted to investigate the interspecific variation in alkaloid content of  Crinum bulpespermum, C. macowanii, and C. moorei using the above-men-tioned data on ontogenic variations.43 Of  the 13 alkaloids used, the presence of  epibuphanisine 25 and undulatine 26 separated C. moorei from C. bulbispermum and C. macowanii. While the pres-ence of  cherylline 8, crinamidine 22, 1-epideacetylbowdenisine 23, powelline 27, and 1-O-acetyllycorine 28 separated C. macowanii and C. moorei from C. bulbispermum. 6-Hydroxycrinamine was detected only in C. bulbispermum. Quantitatively, the levels of  crinine 2, powelline 27, undulatine 26, 1-epideacetylbowdenisine 23, crinamidine 22, and 3-O-acetylhamayne 30 were significantly higher in the bulbs, leaves, and flowering stalks of  C. moorei than those of  C. bulbispermum and C. macowanii. The roots of  C. moorei had a significantly high level of  cherylline 8, powelline 27, crin-amidine 22, and 1-epideacetylbowdenisine 23 than in C. bulbisper-mum and C. macowanii. The study also found that leaves of  C. moorei had the highest alkaloid content throughout the year but no alkaloids were detected in the leaves of  both C. bulbispermum and C. macowanii. Principal component analysis of  these alkaloids revealed that C. macowanii is much closely related to C. bulbisper-mum than C. moorei.43 These findings are in agreement with find-ings from morphological characters. Crinum moorei differs morphologically from all South African Crinum species. The plant forms a false stem from the thickened and hardened leaf-bases. The bulb has leaves at the apex which do not die back and grow out again the following year.44 Other alkaloids that are unique to certain genera or species could be used as taxonomic markers. For instance, Nair et al suggested that distichamine 15 which is detected only in members of  the genus Boophone namely Boophone disticha and B. haemanthoides is of  significance as a distinctive che-motaxonomic marker for the genus Boophone.6Extracts from members of  the plant family Amaryllidaceae and their alkaloidal constituents have exhibited various biolog-ical activities such as antimicrobial, antitumor, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and central nervous system diseases.2,17 However, the pharmacological importance of  the family received much attention after approval of  the selective, revers-ible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor galanthamine 4 for the management of  Alzheimer’s disease by the FDA and many European countries. Other promising molecules are the isocar-bostyrils pancratistatin 31 and narciclasine 32 for their demon-strated anticancer and cell-line specific activities.16,45  Species Alkaloid constituents Biological activity ReferenceCyrtanthus obliquus Ait.

ContinuedElgorashi 5    Natural Product Communications6The approval of  galanthamine 4 for the management of  Alzheimer’s disease fuelled research on the Amaryllidaceae plants throughout the world with the Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development (RCPGD), University of  KwaZulu Natal as no exception. Research on central nervous system dis-orders started in 2003 with the introduction of  2 biological assays: the AChE and serotonin re-uptake inhibitory assays. The AChE enzyme is responsible for the degradation of  ace-tylcholine at the central cholinergic synaptic junction leading to impairment of  cognitive functions including memory loss and inability to perform basic daily life activities.46,47 Several mem-bers of  Amaryllidaceae have been screened for their AChE inhibitory activity. Extracts from B. disticha, Crinum campanula-tum, Crinum graminicola, C. macowanii, and C. moorei inhibited AChE activity. The activity is attributed to galanthamine 4 as all extracts tested contained a band corresponding to galanth-amine 4 in thin layer chromatography plates.48,49 Extracts from C. contractus,30 S. puniceus (IC50 = 70 µg/mL,37 and different parts of  C. vansonii (IC50 = 7.7-25.6 µg/mL) inhibited AChE as well.4 Bulbs of  C. moorei had an IC50 as low as 2.9 µg/mL.29 Narciprimine 16 (IC50 = 78.9 µM) has been identified as the compound responsible for activity from C. contractus,30 while haemanthamine 33 (IC50 = 23.7 µM), haemanthidine 34 (IC50 = 23.1 µM), and the chlorinated amide metolachlor 21 (IC50 = 11.5 µM) are behind the activity of  S. puniceus.37 Metolachlor is a known synthetic herbicide, its presence in crude extracts of  S. puniceus is likely due to contamination of  the plant material in the field and raises concern about the quality of  commer-cially available medicinal plants.Screening of  several alkaloids isolated from a number of  South African Amaryllidaceae species for activities against AChE showed differences related to different ring types. Lycorine- and galanthmine-type alkaloids were the most active ones against AChE compared to crinine- , tazettine-, and cheryl-line-type alkaloids which showed only weak activity against AChE. The alkaloid 1-O-acetyllycorine 28 (IC50 = 0.96 µM) exhibited inhibitory effects 2-fold more potent than that of  the currently used drug galanthamine 4 (IC50 = 1.9 µM). However, the alkaloids crinine 2 (IC50 = 461 µM), crinamine 24 (IC50 = 300 µM), epivittatine 35 (IC50 = 239), 6-hydroxycrinamine 29 (IC50 = 490 µM), N-desmethyl 8α-ethoxy pretazettine 10 (IC50 = 234 µM), N-desmethyl-8β-ethoxy pretazettine 11 (IC50 = 419 µM), and lycorine 3 (IC50 = 213 µM) had weak activity.24The surface electrostatic potential of  these alkaloids was calculated in a structure activity relationship study to investi-gate the correlation between the surface charge distribution of  the alkaloids and their IC50. The surface charge distribution of  1-O-acetyllycorine 28 was found to be much closer to the most active group, the galanthamine-type alkaloids than to those of  the lycorine-type alkaloids. Moreover, superpositioning of  galanthamine 4 on 1-O-acetyllycorine 28 indicated that the 1-O-acetyl group and the nitrogen atom of  the later superim-pose on the hydroxyl group and the nitrogen atom of  galanth-amine 4, respectively.45 Greenblatt et al50 investigated the mechanism of  galanthamine 4 binding to the active site of  AChE. The group reported that the double bond of  the cyclo-hexene ring of  galanthamine 4 stacks against the indole-ring binding site, while the O-methyl group of  galanthamine 4 occupies the acetyl-binding pocket of  acetylcholine. However, from the analysis and superpositioning of  1-O-acetyllycorine 28 and other related lycorine-type alkaloids on galanthamine 4, it appears that the methoxy group of  galanthamine 4 partially aligns with the methylenedioxy group of  the lycorine-type alka-loids, while the double bond of  the cyclohexene ring of  galan-thamine 4 does not align with any part of  the lycorine-type alkaloids. This indicates that the mechanism of  binding of  1-O-acetyllycorine 28 to AChE enzyme might not be the same as that of  galanthamine 4.45Depression is a disabling illness that causes significant impairment and incurs large costs in the form of  lost produc-tivity and health care expenses. The neurotransmitters sero-tonin, noradrenalin, and dopamine are believed to be strongly implicated in the neuropathology of  the disease.51 Several anti-depressants are known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibi-tors (SSRI) as they exert their effect by selective inhibition of  serotonin re-uptake by binding to a specific site on the neuro-nal serotonin transporter thereby inhibiting the transportation of  serotonin from the synaptic gap back to the neuron.52 Few South African Amaryllidaceae species have been investigated for their affinity for the serotonin re-uptake transport protein.52 Extracts of  the leaves and bulbs of  B. disticha have exhibited strong affinity to the SSRI site, while leaf  extracts of  Brunsvigia grandiflora and root extracts of  G. ciliaris have moderate to low affinity to SSRI site, respectively.52 In addition, ethanolic extracts of  B. disticha showed functional inhibition of  serotonin transporter, noradrenalin transporter, and dopamine trans-porter upon screening in a functional inhibition assay using COS-7 cells.51 The activity was confirmed in vivo using the tail suspension test and the forced swim test in both mice and rats.51 A bioassay guided fractionation of  extracts from B. disti-cha led to the identification of  buphandrine 36 (IC50 = 274 µM) and buphanamine 37 (IC50 = 1799 µM) as the active constituents.19The activity of  Amaryllidaceae alkaloids from B. disticha prompted the screening of  several Amaryllidaceae alkaloids iso-lated from a number of  Crinum and Cyrtanthus species for their affinity to the SSRI site. Of  the 21 alkaloids tested, cherylline 8 (IC50 = 3.4 µM) had the highest affinity to SSRI followed by epivittatine 35 (IC50 = 12.1 µM). Cherylline 8 shares some structural features with the antidepressant drug sertraline, while the activity of  epivittatine 35 was attributed to the pres-ence of  a 1,3-dioxole moiety in common with the used SSRI drug paroxetin which could explain their high affinity to SSRI. Other alkaloids with affinity to the serotonin transporter are mostly crinine-type alkaloids namely powelline (IC50 = 20 µM), maritidine 38 (IC50 = 20 µM), epibuphanisine 25 (IC50 = 78.2 µM), and O-methylmaritidine 39 (IC50 = 40.1 µM) which had moderate activity. While crinine 2 (IC50 = 267 µM), crinamine 24 (IC50 = 608 µM), and 1-O-acetyllycorine 28 (IC50 = 452 µM) had weak affinity to the protein.25Elgorashi 7The search for antimicrobial active crude extracts and mole-cules from the Amaryllidaceae plants is inspired by the widespread use of  these plants in traditional medicine for the treatment of  wounds and infections by different South African cultural groups. For example, Tswana people in South Africa use C. bul-bispermum for the treatment of  kidney and bladder infections. The Zulu use C. macowanii for the treatment of  urinary tract problem. Sotho and Khosa, on the other hand, use leaves of  B. disticha for the treatment of  skin diseases.13-15 Of  the Amaryllidaceae species evaluated for antibacterial activity, Cyrtanthus falactus, Cyrtanthus mackenii, Cyrtanthus suaveolens, and G. ciliaris inhibited the growth of  5 bacterial strains and including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains.33 The screening was done using the disc diffusion assay and the antibacterial activity of  these extracts was expressed as a ratio to that produced by the positive control neomycin. All 3 Cyrtanthus species inhibited the bacterial growth of  at least 1 strain with the ratio to neomycin within the range of  0.01 to 0.91 with the dichloromethane extracts of  the underground parts of  C. suaveolens scoring the highest ratio to neomycin. Gethyllis ciliaris, on the other hand, inhibited only the growth of  the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Low antibacterial activity was observed for other Amaryllidaceae plants. For example, bulb extracts of  Haemanthus albiflos inhibited only the growth of  E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia,53 and Cyrtanthus obliquuos had weak activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.54 Cryptostephanus vansonii, however, inhibited the activity of  all 4 strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) val-ues ranging from >0.5 to 0.25 mg/mL.4 The work has been extended to B. disticha, another member of  the Amaryllidaceae family where the ethanolic bulb extracts inhibited the growth of  both the Gram-positive (B. subtilis and S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli and K. pneumonia) strains. The MIC values ranged from 0.13 to 0.25 mg/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of  the active alkaloids buphanidrine 36 and disti-chamine 15 (MIC = 0.063-0.13 mg/mL).20 The low activity of  2 alkaloids is in agreement with the previous studies in the labora-tory where none of  21 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids investigated inhibited bacterial growth at a concentration of  250 µg/mL.55Seasonal variation is one of  the major contributing factors to variations in secondary metabolites production by plants which may in turn affect their pharmacological properties for the benefit of  the people. Ethanol bulb extracts of  C. contractus collected monthly over a year were investigated for antibacte-rial activity against B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumonia. The extracts collected in May and July were the only extracts that had good antibacterial activity (<1.0 mg/mL) against at least 2 bacterial strains.31Few studies carried out at RCPGD focused on antifungal activity mostly against the opportunistic fungus Candida albi-cans31,34,53,54 and to a lesser extent on skin fungi such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, and Micrococcus canis.53 Extracts of  Cyrtanthus obliquus had significant antifungal activity against C. albicans with an MIC value as low as 0.195 mg/mL.54 While extracts of  C. contractus and H. albiflos were not active.31,53The majority of  studies dedicated to in vitro screening of  plant extracts for anti-inflammatory activity followed an ethno-botanical lead.33,54,56 Plants traditionally used to treat pain, fever, swelling of  the body, asthma, and joint pain have been targeted in a course of  continued investigation of  South African plants for anti-inflammatory activity. Initially, crude extracts were screened for their inhibition of  cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activity. Cyclooxygenase converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins which are involved in the complex pro-cess of  inflammation and are responsible for the sensation of  pain.57 A number of  South African Amaryllidaceae species inhibited COX-1 activity including B. disticha (55%-65%).56,58 Others were screened against both COX-1 and COX-2 activi-ties including bulb extracts of  C. moorei which exhibited an inhibition of  84% to 99% against COX-1 and 52% to 75% inhibitory activity against COX-2,29 and bulb extracts of  C. obliquus inhibited COX-1 activity by 50% to 75% and COX-2 by 15% to 85%.54 Dichloromethane (DCM) and methanolic extracts from different parts of  Cyrtanthus falcatus, C. mackenii, C. suaveolens, G. ciliaris, Gethyllis multifolia, and Gethyllis villosa inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activities. The DCM extracts had strong activity against both COX-1 (93%-100%) and COX-2 (73%-96%) when tested at a concentration of  250 µg/mL. The methanolic extracts however were less active against both enzyme activities.33 Bioassay-guided fractionation of  extracts of  G. ciliaris led to the isolation of  the COX-1 inhibi-tor isogeunitol 18 (IC50 = 262 µM).36The seasonal variation in bulb extracts from C. contractus col-lected monthly over a year on COX activity was investigated. The extracts exhibited moderate to high activity throughout the year (≥40%) against both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Extracts from bulbs collected during August, September, and December had high activity against both enzymes, with those obtained in September exhibiting the highest activity against COX-1. The high activity in September coincided with the high alkaloidal content within the duration of  the study period which may attribute this high activity, in part, to high alkaloidal content.31Bulbs of  H. albiflos are used in South African traditional medicine to treat aching skin, while leaves are used for the treatment of  wounds, sores, and ulcers.13 In a search for agents that can prevent the development of  skin scarring and dark spots as a result of  the inflammatory process, a 3-step screen-ing targeting pro-inflammatory enzymes was conducted on extracts of  H. albiflos. First, extracts of  H. albiflos were screened against phospholipase A2, an enzyme that catalyzes the release of  arachidonic acid from the cell membrane phospholipid layer. Arachidonic acid serves as a precursor for eicosanoids which are responsible for acute skin inflammation. Haemanthus albiflos extracts had low inhibitory activity against phospholi-pase A2 (IC50 = 15.8-28.1 µg/mL). This low activity against phospholipase A2 necessitated exploration of  other mecha-nisms by which the extracts may induce their effects on the skin scars and spots. The search then shifted to 15-lipoxygen-ase, an enzyme involved in the inflammatory process through Natural Product Communications8conversion of  the released arachidonic acid to hydroxyeicosa-tetraenoic acid which results in skin psoriasis. Again, the extracts exhibited only low activity against the 15-LOX enzyme with IC50 values range of  35.4 to 64.6 µg/mL. The extracts, however, had noticeable activity against COX-1 (IC50 = 1.9-5.3 µg/mL) and COX-2 (IC50 = 4.3-14.9 µg/mL).59Interestingly, in a screening program of  15 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, isolated from C. bulbispermum and C. moorei, against COX-1 and COX-2 activities, most alkaloids exhibited only low activity against the former and no activity against the lat-ter.55 The results suggest that the assumption that the rationale behind uses of  Crinum species in traditional medicine attributed largely to their alkaloid content needs to be carefully revised and revisited.55 In addition, lectin-like protein isolated and par-tially purified from C. moorei was not active against COX-1 enzyme.60The toxic and poisonous nature of  different members of  Amaryllidaceae has been utilized by different ethnic groups in traditional medicine and other cultural rites. For instance, the Khoi and San people of  South Africa use bulbs of  B. disticha as arrow poison.13-15 Another example is the use of  the outer scales of  the bulb of  Crinum kirkii in Kenya as a rat poison.61 In fact, the medicinal utilization of  the toxic properties of  members of  the family Amaryllidaceae for the treatment of  tumors can be traced back to the times of  Hippocrates and Pliny and continued by practitioners of  the middle ages throughout the world.62 It is the poisonous properties of  cer-tain members of  the family Amaryllidaceae that led many inves-tigators during the 19th century to seek for active compounds from this family. However, scientists had to wait until 1877 for the isolation of  lycorine 3 as the first alkaloid from the family63 although lycorine 3 is known for its antiproliferative properties against a wide range of  cancerous cell lines. However, the dis-covery of  the potent, cell line specific anticancer isocarbostyril pancratistatin 31, which has shown most promise for clinical development as an anticancer drug, that attracted attention to Amaryllidaceae as a potential source of  anticancer drugs. This inspired the group at the Research Centre to embark on the screening of  Amaryllidaceae alkaloids for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of  normal and cancerous cell lines namely human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma, and the normal human fibroblasts cell lines.21,23Of  the alkaloids lycorine 3, crinine 2, buphanisine 45, buphanidrine 36, ambelline 40, undulatine 26, distichamine 15, and distichaminol 14 isolated from B. haemanthoides screened for cytotoxic effects against the above-mentioned cell lines, only lycorine 3 and distichamine 15 had noticeable cytotoxic effects on all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values ranging from 1.8 to 8.9 µM for lycorine 3 and 2.3 to 12.4 for ditichamine 15.23 The low activity of  the β-crinane alkaloids is in line with the previous studies on various cancerous cell lines.21 The results of  this study are a confirmation of  earlier findings where both lycorine 3 and distichamine 15 signifi-cantly decreased the viability of  the above cancerous and normal cell lines with the cervical adenocarcinoma cell line more sensitive to distichamine 15 (IC50 = 2.2 µM). The study also found that the galanthamine-type alkaloids galanthamine 4, lycoramine 41, and narwedine 42 had very low influence on the viability of  both human cancer and normal cell lines.21 Haemanthamine 33 was found to be active across the cell lines screened (IC50 = 2.1-8.1 µM), while narciprimine 16 was only active against acute lymphoblastic leukemia and homolycorine 6 was active against acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Buphanidrine 36, however, was only active against the normal human fibro-blast cell line.21Flow cytometry on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CEM) cancer cells revealed that treatment with distichamine 15 increased the proportion of  G2/M phase cells in a dose-de-pendent manner, with concomitant reductions in the propor-tion of  G0/G1 and S cells. The proportion of  cells with sub-G1 amounts of  DNA (apoptotic cells) increased following a 24 hours treatment with distichamine 15, relative to that observed in untreated cells. Narciprimine 16 showed similar effects but with insignificant increase in sub-G1 fraction. Thus, of  2 compounds, distichamine 15 was clearly capable of  cell cycle disturbance and apoptosis induction in CEM cancer cells. Distichamine 15 also induced apoptosis of  CEM through the activation of  caspase 3/7. This finding was supported further by Western blot analysis which revealed a decreased level of  the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 which is necessary for cell viability.21Screening of  crude extracts for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of  cancer and normal cell lines has also been envisaged. For instance, bulb extracts of  C. contractus collected monthly over 12 months were investigated for their cytotoxic effects against human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma, and the normal human fibroblasts cell lines. Extracts of  bulbs collected in May (IC50 = 11.7-37.9 µg/mL) and September (IC50 = 23.5-91.7 µg/mL) caused the highest level of  cytotoxicity, while those collected in June and November (IC50 >100 µg/mL) had the least cytotoxic effect. The variation was attributed largely to variation in the quantity and composition of  the total alkaloid content.31 In addition, extracts of  different plant parts of  C. vansonii had modest cytotoxic activity against Vero Monkey Kidney cell line with IC50 values ranged from 12.6 to 62.6 µg/mL.4Plants in general and those used in traditional medicine in particular are considered to be safe due to their long-term use by humans. However, research have shown that some plants used as food and as herbal medicine are mutagenic and car-cinogenic.64–66 This made it necessary to screen plants for their potential mutagenic effect and plants that show mutagenic potential should be considered safe only after rigorous toxico-logical testing. With this in mind, many South African plants used in the South African traditional medicine, including mem-bers of  the family Amaryllidaceae, have been screened by van Staden and coworkers for their mutagenic potential.21,54,64,67,68 Elgorashi 9In a screening of  51 South African plant species for their potential mutagenic effect using Ames and Vitotox tests, DCM extracts of  bulbs of  C. macowanii were mutagenic to strain TA98, a frameshift mutation detecting strain, without meta-bolic activation in a dose-dependent manner. However, only the highest concentration tested (5 mg/mL) was mutagenic with metabolic activation, while bulb extracts of  B. disticha were not mutagenic with and without metabolic activation.65 Interestingly, DCM extracts of  both species were highly toxic upon testing in the micronucleus test on human lymphocytes. However, methanolic extracts of  2 species induced a signifi-cant number of  micronuclei when compared to the blank control.67Investigation of  dichloromethane and methanolic extracts of  different parts of  C. falcatus, C. mackenii, C. suaveolens, G. cili-aris, G. multifolia, and G. villosa for their mutagenic potentials in Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain indicated that only extracts from different parts of  C. falcatus and C. sua-veolens induced mutagenic effects.33 In other studies, mutagenic effects were not detected for extracts from C. obliquus and S. puniceus toward S. typhimurium TA98 strain.54 Bioassy-guided fractionation of  the crude extracts of  C. suaveolens led to the isolation of  captan 43 as the active principles at a concentra-tion of  100 mg/kg of  dry plant material. The plant material was purchased from a nursery that uses different agricultural practises including pesticide application to increase production and manage pests. The use of  captan 43, which has been com-mercially available fungicide and bactericide in large-scale agri-culture, formed part of  these practices. Metolachlor 21 is another synthetic pesticide isolated from S. puniceus.37 The detection of  captan 43 in C. suaveolens and metolachlor 21 from S. puniceus raises concern about the safety of  traditional medic-inal plants grown commercially in South Africa and the need for the establishment of  good agricultural practise guidelines and regulations.35The RCPGD also published several reviews on the phyto-chemistry and biological activities on specific species and gen-era such as B. disticha69 and Crinum.10 Special reviews on biological activities of  Amaryllidaceae alkaloids covered antibac-terial,70 antifungal,71 and cytotoxic activities.16,21,72–75In summary, the research group contributed considerably in expanding our knowledge on the chemistry and biological activities of  the plant family Amaryllidaceae. Of  particular inter-est is the unraveling of  the potential of  1-O-acetyllycorine as a potent inhibitor of  the AChE enzyme which is associated with the pathology of  Alzheimer’s disease. Another finding is the uncovering of  the antiproliferative activity of  distichamine and narciprimine and their potential as lead molecules for antican-cer drug discovery. Other biological properties such as antimi-crobial and anti-inflammatory activities have given important insights on the potential of  the plant family in drug discovery.Declaration of  Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of  interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of  this article.FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of  this article.References 1.
