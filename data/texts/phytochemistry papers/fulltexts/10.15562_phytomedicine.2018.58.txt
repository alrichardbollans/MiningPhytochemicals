ABSTRACT
The aim of the present review is to provide information on the ethno-
medical use and scientific knowledge on Psidium guajava to researchers 
in the field of biology, chemistry and pharmacognosy. A literature 
search was conducted to obtain information about the phytochemistry 
and pharmacology of Psidium guajava from the electronic databases 
like PubMed, PubMed Central, Science Direct and Google scholar. 
Scientific name of this plant species was used as keyword for the 
search, along with the terms phytochemistry and pharmacology. The 
chemical structure of the P. guajava naturally occurring compounds was 
drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0 software package. An extensive 
survey of literature (Multidisciplinary advanced bibliographic surveys) 
revealed that Psidium guajava L. is a good source of health promoting 
secondary metabolites like Flavonoids, Tannins, glycosides, terpenoids, 
etc. The medicinal plant Psidium guajava is reported to possess various 
pharmacological properties like anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
antibacterial, anticough, antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, 
cardioprotective, antimutagenic, hepatoprotective and larvicidal effects. 
These properties are due to the presence of various phytochemicals like 
tannins, alkaloids, phenols, glycosides, flavonoids and steroids.
The present review can therefore help inform future scientific research 
towards the development of novel drugs against Sickle cell Anemia 
because of the presence of naturally occurring triterpenoids acids 
like Guavacoumaric, Ursolic, 2α-hydroxyursolic, Maslinic, Asiatic, 
Jacoumaric, Isoneriucoumaric, Guajavanoic and Guavenoic acids.
Keywords: Psidium guajava, primary health care, phyto-constituents, pharmacology, electronic databases
INTRODUCTION
Tropical medicinal plant species are known for 
their richness in biologically active secondary 
metabolites and essential oils of therapeutic 
relevance. The principal advantages claimed 
for therapeutic uses of botanicals against vari-
ous ailments are their safety besides being 
economical, effective and their easy availabil-
ity. Because of these advantages the medicinal 
plants are widely used by the traditional healers 
in their day to day practice.1 The World Health 
Organization (WHO) reported that about 80% 
of the population living in developing countries 
relies on traditional medicine for their primary 
health care needs.2 This is the case of Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC) where medicinal 
plants represent the key product for both urban 
and rural populations for their health care 
needs because the costs of conventional drugs 
are often unaffordable. These plants have found 
to have great therapeutic relevance for fighting 
major health problems.3-10 The present review 
was conducted in order to obtain updated infor-
mation about the  phytochemistry and pharma-
cology of P. guajava L., a useful medicinal plant 
species of pharmaceutical relevance which could 
be developped as medicine for managing various 
ailments including Sickle cell anemia.
BOTANY 
The plant Psidium guajava L. (figure 1) belongs to 
the family of Myrtaceae which is native from trop-
ical America. This family contains dicotyledonous 
plant widely distributed in warm regions of the 
world and it contains approximately 3000 species 
divided into 130 genera. Guava is an exotic fruit and 
its shape ranges from round, ovoid, to pear-shaped, 
and with an average diameter and weight ranging 
from 4-10cm and 100-400 g respectively. Classified 
as a berry, this plant species is composed of a fleshy 
mesocarp of varying thickness and a softer endo-
carp with numerous small, hard yellowish-cream 
seeds embedded throughout it.11-13

and starch.31 Quercetin-3-O-β-D-(2”-O-galloyl 
 glucoside)-4’-O-vinylpropionate was isolated from 
the leaves of this medicinal plant species.32 The 
twigs of P. guajava contain calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorous, potassium and sodium. Guava has 
been reported to be the second fruit with the high-
est concentration of ascorbic acid (ranging from 
60-1000 mg/100 g) of all fruits.33 
PHARMACOLOGY
Antioxidant activity
Recent findings revealed that P. guajava is an 
 excellent source of antioxidant phytochemicals.34 
The methanolic extract of leaves revealed high anti-
oxidant activity. The active principles are quercetin, 
quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, morin, ascorbic 
acid, carotenoids, and polyphenolics.35 
Antibacterial activity
The aqueous and organic extracts of P. guajava 
leaves revealed antibacterial activity against 
Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus spp., and Shigella spp. 
While no activity against Citrobacter spp, Alcaligenes 
fecalis, and Aspergillus spp was observed.36,37 The 
aqueous extracts of P. guajava leaves, roots and 
stem bark were active against the gram-positive 
bacteria Bacillus subtilis and virtually inactive 
against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aqueous, alcohol 
and chloroform extracts of leaves were effective 
against Aeromonas hydrophila, Shigella spp and 
Vibrio spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea and

Mycobacterium phlei.18 The antimicrobial activity 
of P. guajava is attributed to guajaverine,psydiolic 
acid and the flavonoid compound guaijaverin.38 The 
essential oil γ–terpinene and γ–pinene displayed 
antimicrobial activity against Propionibacterium 
acnes.39 
Anti-diarrheal activity
The leaves of P. guajava L. is traditionally used as an 
antidiarrheal medicine.40,41 This activity is explained 
through spasmolytic, antibacterial and antiamoebic 
effects and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and 
tannins have been reported to exhibit the antidi-
arrheal activity through denaturing protein hence 
forming interaction protein-tannates which reduce 
the intestinal mucosa permeability.42,43 Additionally, 
the calcium-antagonist properties of the biologi-
cally active compound namely quercetin explain the 
spasmolytic effect of this popular herbal remedy.44 
Anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic 
activities
P. guajava is used in folk medicine for the treatment 
of diabetes mellitus.45 The leaves aqueous extract, 
was reported to possess inhibitory effect against 
carbohydrate-degrading enzymes and also possess 
the ability to suppress the postprandial blood 
glucose level in human.46 The leaf extract is also 
claimed as inhibitor of lipase. 
This extract inhibits carbohydrate absorption 
and prevents obesity, heart disease and atheroscle-
rosis.46 The medically active principles in the etha-
nolic and n-butanol extracts were identified as the 
tannins isostrictinin, strictinin, and pedunculagin.47
Gallic acid, catechin and quercetin inhibit the 
formation of α-dicarbonyl compounds and AGEs 
formation in BSA glycation systems.48 Quercetin, 
kaempferol, myricetin displayed inhibitory effects 
against sucrose, maltase, and α-amylase.49 
Cardioprotective effects
P. Guajava L. was reported to possess cardi-
oprotective effects against myocardial 
 ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts 
with quercetin and gallic acid as the biologically 
active compounds.50 The alcoholic, aqueous and 
ethyl acetate soluble fractions and essential oil 
of the leaves of P. guajava inhibit the ventricular 
contraction of isolated rabbit heart.51 Aqueous 
leaves extract of Psidium guajava possess contrac-
tile effect on rat aorta rings.52 Acute intrave-
nous administration of the aqueous  extract of 
P. guajava leaf was reported to cause reduction in 
systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rates 
of hypertensive rats. Secondary metabolites such 
as polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, pentacy-
clic triterpenoids, quercetin, guiajaverin, tannins 
present in this plant are considered as responsible 
for the observed hypotensive bioactivity.53 
Antimutageni cand anticancer activities
P. guajava L. leaves were reported to possess anti-
mutagenic activity, flavonoids were claimed to be 
responsible for this activity.51,52-54 The plant was 
also reported to possess anticancer effects against 
selected cancerous cell lines like cervical cancer 
(HeLa), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and osteo-
sarcoma (MG-63), colorectal carcinoma (RKO-
AS45-1), and lung ﬁbroblast (Wi-26VA4).55,56 The

the essential oil of P. guajava was reported to kill 
myeloma, prostate and breast cancer cell lines.57 
Hepatoprotective activity
The aqueous extract of leaves of P. guajava possesses 
an interesting hepatoprotective activity.58 Indeed, 
injury induction of healthy clone 9 liver cells using 
5% alcohol concentration for 30 minutes revealed 
the hepatoprotective properties of Psidium guajava 
extracts. Hot water extracts showed high hepato-
protective and lower cytotoxic effects than other 
extracts.59-60
Larvicidal effect of essential oils
The essential oil obtained from leaves of Psidium 
guajava has displayed promising larvicidal activity 
against A. aegypti with LC50 ranging from 39.48 to 
64.25 μg mL−1.59
Others pharmacological actions of Psidium 
Guajava L. and toxicity
The leaves of the plant P. guajava were reported 
to possess also interesting pharmaceutical prop-
erties such as retroviral reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor activity, depressant activity on central 
nervous system, antinociceptive/analgesic activ-
ity, anticestodal activity, spasmolytic activity, 
Anticough action, antifungal activity and anti-
ulcer activity. The water extract of the leaves of 
this medicinal plant species has no short term 
harmful effect and was found to be non toxic 
toward animal model systems like rats and mice 
at 5000 mg/Kg.61 
CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS
The literature survey revealed that Psidium 
guajava L. is a pharmacologically and chemically 
much studied plant species, although the diver-
sity of secondary metabolites present in the plant 
species especially triterpenoids derived acids 
(Guavacoumaric, Ursolic, 2α-hydroxyursolic, 
Maslinic, Asiatic, Jacoumaric, Isoneriucoumaric, 
Guajavanoic and Guavenoic acids) make P. guajava 
a good candidate for the development of new lead 
compounds against Sickle cell Anemia.
