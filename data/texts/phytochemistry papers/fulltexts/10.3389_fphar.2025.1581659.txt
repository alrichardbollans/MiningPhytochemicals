(Passifloraceae) comprises over106 species of climbing plants, predominantly found in tropicaland subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.This genus is notable for its extensive morphological diversityand ecological versatility, allowing species to thrive in variousenvironments, from arid landscapes to lush rainforests (Hearn,2007; Sinei and Mwangi, 2015; Rotich, 2022). Traditionally,Adenia species are utilized across numerous cultures formedicinal purposes, with different parts of the plant—such asleaves, roots, stems, fruits, and seeds—being employed to treatvarious ailments, including wounds, fever, gastrointestinalissues, pain, and inflammation (Sarkodie et al., 2013; Sineiand Mwangi, 2015; Barua et al., 2020; Maroyi, 2020; Rotich,2022; Chibuye et al., 2024). The presence of bioactivecompounds further underscores the therapeutic potential ofthese species.Ethnobotanical studies have consistently emphasized theimportance of Adenia species in traditional medicine,particularly in Africa, where species like A. gummifera, A.cissampeloides, and A. lobata are utilized for variousmedicinal applications (Ibiam et al., 2015; Ogunlesi et al.,2019; Garba Koffi et al., 2021; N’Go et al., 2021; Rotich et al.,2021; Florian et al., 2022). The pharmacological relevance ofthese plants is enhanced by their chemical diversity, featuringnumerous secondary metabolites including alkaloids,glycosides, flavonoids, steroids, and terpenoids (Ogunlesiet al., 2019; Garba Koffi et al., 2021; Immaculate et al., 2022).These compounds are believed to contribute to thepharmacological effects seen in Adenia species, includingantimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, andanalgesic activities (Fowa et al., 2019; Barua et al., 2020; Maroyi,2020; Bortolotti et al., 2021; N’Go et al., 2021; Rotich, 2022).Notably, ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), particularlytype 2, may play a significant role in the cytotoxic and toxicproperties of certain Adenia species, with several demonstratingselective toxicity against cancer cell lines, making thempromising candidates for anticancer drug development (Tosiet al., 2009; Battelli et al., 2010; Bortolotti et al., 2021; Maielloet al., 2021; Rotich, 2022).Despite their potential therapeutic benefits, concerns about thesafety and toxicity of Adenia species are growing, especially giventheir extensive use in traditional medicine. Limited toxicologicaldata indicate that some species may exhibit adverse effects at specificdosages (Ekpo et al., 2017; Uno et al., 2018; Barua et al., 2020; Rageet al., 2024). This highlights the necessity for thorough safetyevaluations before recommending Adenia products fortherapeutic purposes. Furthermore, the lack of clinical dataregarding the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Adeniacompounds necessitates more rigorous research to establish clearguidelines for their medicinal use. This review aims to synthesize theexisting literature on the ethnobotany, phytochemistry,pharmacology, and toxicity of the genus Adenia. By exploringtraditional uses, chemical constituents, pharmacologicalproperties, and potential risks, this review underscores thetherapeutic potential and the need for further scientificinvestigation into these remarkable plants.2 MethodologyA thorough literature review was carried out using databases likeGoogle Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, JSTOR, and Web ofScience, covering articles published from 1935 to 2024. Thesedatabases were selected for their relevance to medicinal plantresearch and their recognition by peer-reviewed literature. Thesearch utilized the keyword “Adenia” combined with terms like“distribution,” “traditional use,” “phytochemicals,” “chemicalcompounds,” “pharmacology,” “bioactivity,” and “toxicity.” Forbotanical descriptions, the Plant List was accessed via WFO plantlist, to compile an exhaustive list of all published Adenia species.Articles were evaluated based on their titles and abstracts, with thefollowing inclusion criteria: (1) only full-text articles or reports thatwere published in or translated into English; (2) original peer-reviewed studies or reports focusing on the ethnobotany,pharmacology, phytochemistry, and toxicity of Adenia species.Exclusion criteria included papers that (1) did not study Adeniaspecies; (2) were not full-text articles; and (3) were narrative orsystematic reviews, or reports lacking original data (such aseditorials, expert opinions, and perspective papers). To avoidduplicate results, all downloaded articles were imported intoEndNote® X9 (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA, USA), whereduplicate reports were removed.3 Results and discussionOur electronic database search generated 3,724 records. Afterdeduplication, screening titles and abstracts, and applying ourinclusion and exclusion criteria, 88 studies from 1935 to2024 were selected for full-text review. The evidence from theseincluded studies is summarized narratively below and listed inTable 1. The review begins with an overview of the botanicaldescription and distribution of Adenia species, followed bysections on their ethnobotany and medicinal uses,phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity studies.3.1 Botanical description and distributionThe genus Adenia, a group of flowering plants in the familyPassifloraceae, is characterized by its climbing or sprawling habit,with stems emerging from above-ground tubers that can reach up to2.5 m wide and feature fleshy, lobed leaves (Liebenberg, 1935; Sineiand Mwangi, 2015). It comprises around 106 species and isconsidered the second-largest genus in the family after Passiflorawith over 500 species (Rotich, 2022). The genus Adenia is primarilyfound in the Old World tropics, where it has undergone significantevolutionary diversification. Its plants are adapted to diverseenvironments, including dry and moist forests, savannawoodlands, and bushlands (Sinei and Mwangi, 2015). It shows anotable diversity in growth forms, ranging from succulent trees,shrubs, and vines to geophytes, lianas, and other unique growthhabits. It is believed that the ancestral Adenia species was likely aliana with storage roots (Hearn, 2006). Several species withinAdeniahave evolved distinct traits, such as stem succulence, which isthought to have evolved independently at least three times, andFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659TABLE 1 Ethnomedicinal importance of the species from the genus Adenia.Name ofthe plantsGeographicallocationVernacularname (localdialect,Country)PartsusedRecipespreparationAdministration TraditionalusesReferencesA. gummiferavar. gummiferaSouth Africa, theDemocratic Republic ofCongo, Ethiopia,Eswatini, Kenya,Mozambique, Malawi,Seychelles, Somalia,Uganda, Tanzania,Zimbabwe, and ZambiaSnake climber(English) kinyelwet(Kipsigis, Kenya)Imfulwa (Zulu,South Africa)Muhore (Shona,Zimbabwe)Mandali (Suaheli)Root,Leaf,wholeplantInfusionsDecoctionPoundingCrushingOral tropical Depression,respiratoryinfections, sexuallytransmittedinfections,infertility, leprosy,malaria, lethargicbirds, flu-likesymptoms,coughing,coccidiosis,blindness, colicwhile and brokenbones.Used as emetics,disinfectant ordiureticAdedapo et al.,2008; Fullas et al.,1995; Jambwa et al.,2022; Luman andMottram, 2006;Maroyi, 2020;Rotich et al., 2021;Rotich, 2022A.cissampeloides(Planch. exHook.)

Many species are dioecious, meaning that male and femaleflowers are found on separate plants, though some species exhibitmonoecy. The flowers, generally glabrous, have variable shapes, withthe male flowers being smaller than the female flowers. The fruits ofAdenia are typically 1-celled capsules that dehisce loculicidally,leaving seeds attached to the middle of the valves. Fruit shapecan range from fusiform to globular, with colors varying fromgreenish to yellow or bright red when ripe (De Wilde, 1971).The distribution of Adenia (Figure 1) is predominantlypaleotropical, with a significant concentration in Africa, where58 species are found, alongside 25 species in Madagascar and14 species in South India, Ceylon, and Indo-Malesia (De Wilde,TABLE 1 (Continued) Ethnomedicinal importance of the species from the genus Adenia.Name ofthe plantsGeographicallocationVernacularname (localdialect,Country)PartsusedRecipespreparationAdministration TraditionalusesReferencesmalaria, diarrhea,and immunebooster for patientswith HIV/AIDSA. wightiana(Wall. ex Wightand Arn.)

The genus extends as far north as the savannabelt south of the Sahara, passing through Sudan and Ethiopia, andinto Yemen, where A. Venenata, the first species described, is found(Liebenberg, 1935; De Wilde, 1971). To the south, Adenia species,such as A. repanda and A. gummifera, are found as far as SouthAfrica, reaching as far south as approximately 30° and 33° latitude,respectively (De Wilde, 1971). In Madagascar, Adenia species arefound in arid and wet regions, from the lowlands to the centralhighlands. The genus also thrives in various habitats, ranging fromthe driest deserts of coastal Namibia to the humid rainforests ofSoutheast Asia (De Wilde, 1971; Hearn, 2006). In the Flora ofSouthern Africa, which includes South Africa, Namibia, Botswana,Lesotho, and Swaziland, the genus Adenia is represented by tenspecies and 13 taxa (Crouch et al., 2016). Among these, Adeniagummifera is notable as one of the two infraspecific varieties of A.gummifera, native to a range from southwest Ethiopia to SouthAfrica and the Seychelles. This species is a tall climber withsomewhat woody stems that grow in altitudes of 50 m. Theleaves of A. gummifera are typically entire or deeply lobed (3-5 lobes), ovate or orbicular in shape, featuring a truncated base(Rotich, 2022).3.2 Ethnobotany and medicinal usesWhile many species of Adenia are toxic and have been used intraditional practices for poisoning or hunting, some are utilized inconventional medicine across various regions for ailments rangingfrom common illnesses to more severe conditions (Sarkodie et al.,2013; Sinei, K. A. and Mwangi, 2015; Barua et al., 2020; Maroyi,2020; Maroyi, 2020; Rotich, 2022; Chibuye et al., 2024). For instance,A. gummifera is particularly recognized for its traditional medicinaluses throughout tropical Africa, occurring naturally in countriessuch as South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,Eswatini, Kenya, Mozambique, Malawi, Seychelles, Somalia,Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. It typically grows onrocky slopes, termite mounds, and ravines, adapting to variousecological niches (Maroyi, 2020). It is well-known as Snakeclimber (English) and also called kinyelwet in the Kipsigiscommunity of Kenya; imfulwa in the Zulu community in SouthAfrica; Muhore in the Shona community of Zimbabwe; andMandalior Ngole in Suaheli or Sukuma communities respectively in EasternAfrica (Luman and Mottram, 2006; Adedapo et al., 2008; Rotichet al., 2021; Jambwa et al., 2022; Rotich, 2022). The infusions of thisplant are used as emetics and for treating depression (Adedapo et al.,2008). The roots are part of an herbal concoction called CareVid,serves as an immune booster and health tonic for treating andmanaging HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections in Kenya (Maroyi,2020; Rotich, 2022). These roots are also employed as a disinfectantor diuretic and traditional medicine for ailments like respiratoryinfections, filariasis, Oral candidiasis, sexually transmittedinfections, gastrointestinal infections, and infertility (Fullas et al.,1995; Maroyi, 2020; Rotich et al., 2021). In nearby Mozambique, aroot infusion is prepared by boiling a six-inch section of the root inFIGURE 2Cyanohydrin glycosides (1-8), Alkaloid (9), and Ceramide (10) from Adenia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659three to four pints of hot water (100°C) for consumption by thepatient to treat malaria and leprosy, often inducing vomiting andperspiration (Luman and Mottram, 2006). The entire plant can bepounded and dissolved in drinking water to treat lethargic birds,coughing, flu-like symptoms, Newcastle disease, coccidiosis, andblindness (Jambwa et al., 2022). In Tanzania, the juice derived fromthe leaves of this plant is used to alleviate colic, while crushed leavesare used topically to help heal broken bones (Fullas et al., 1995).However, hepatic toxicity has been associated with the chronictraditional use of A. leaves among the Zulu of South Africa(Fullas et al., 1995; Luman and Mottram, 2006). The leaves arealso cooked as a vegetable in tropical Africa (Maroyi, 2020). Thestems and roots of the plant are sold as traditional remedies ininformal herbal medicine markets in Mozambique, Botswana,Gauteng, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces in South Africa (Maroyi,2020). The stems of A. gummifera are combined with other plants tocreate a mixture for protective charms (Luman and Mottram, 2006).Another most used plant is A. cissampeloides, which iscommonly known as snake climber or monkey rope, and locallycalled Muore in Zimbabwe, Arokeke or Godogbo among the Yorubain Nigeria (Ishola et al., 2015; Ngarivhume et al., 2015). It thrives inhumid areas of West Africa, distributed from Senegal to Somalia,with a notable presence in Ghana and Nigeria (Agbor and Okoi,2014; Uno et al., 2018; Uzoeto et al., 2018). This plant has a widerange of traditional medicinal applications, including cold or hotinfusions of the root or bark for treating malaria and fever(Ngarivhume et al., 2015). It is also widely used as a fishingpoison by various tribes from Senegal to Tanzania; in Nigeria,fresh leaves are roasted, pounded, and thrown into rivers,resulting in small fish floating dead within 15 minutes and largerFIGURE 3Glycosyl flavonoids from Adenia species.FIGURE 4Steroids and Triterpenes from Adenia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659fish within an hour (Neuwinger, 2004; Agbor, R.P. and Okoi, 2014;Ibiam et al., 2015; Uno et al., 2018). The stem is used in Nigeria asfish poison when macerated in water and as emetic for biliousness(Ibiam et al., 2015). In Ghana, it treats malaria, dysentery,rheumatic pain, hypertension, and numbness (Annan et al.,2012), while its leaves are used as a vegetable, and the sapserves as a cosmetic (Ibiam et al., 2015; Ogunlesi et al., 2019).In Ivory Coast, the leaf extract is applied to the breast afterchildbirth to encourage lactation (Ibiam et al., 2015).Decoctions and infusions of the leaves, stem, or root areemployed for gastrointestinal disorders like constipation anddiarrhea, as well as rheumatic pain and wound dressing(Nyansah et al., 2016; Ekpo et al., 2017). These decoctions orinfusions are also used to address various inflammatoryconditions, including edema and rheumatism, as well as toprovide pain relief, particularly for headaches and back pain.Moreover, pounded roots are commonly used to dress soresand wounds (Ekpo et al., 2017). The decoction made from theleaves or roots is consumed as a diuretic and to treat malaria andfever (Ekpo et al., 2017). For leprosy, a decoction made from theleaves is applied directly to the sores, while an oral intake of rootdecoction is combined with a steam bath using the leaves. To treatscabies, ashes from the root or bark are combined with castor oil. Aroot decoction is consumed to manage cholera and is taken withmilk to address anemia in eastern Africa. An extract from the rootsand stems is used orally for intestinal worms, and a decoction fromleaves is consumed for liver issues. A paste made from leaves isused on fractures and broken bones in Tanzania (Ekpo et al., 2017).Additionally, leaf infusions serve as stimulants for depression andinsanity in Zimbabwe, with the inner bark used by the Manopeople of Liberia to induce amnesia (Ishola et al., 2015). The plantis noted for its antiplasmodial and antimicrobial properties (Agborand Okoi, 2014; Nyansah et al., 2016). While it possesses toxicproperties, particularly due to the gum resin containing modeccin,A. cissampeloides remains economically important for its diversemedicinal uses and fishing practices (Ibiam et al., 2015).Additionally, A. lobata is a species widely utilized in traditionalmedicine across African regions. It extends from Senegal to Angolaand Cameroon, and is particularly used in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, andeastern Nigeria. It is a liana that is often employed for the treatmentof various ailments, including jaundice, malaria, headaches,abdominal pains, otitis, coughs, infantile asthma, rheumatic,respiratory disorders, syphilis, gonorrhea, and even nose cancer(KoffiMarcel et al., 2011; Agoreyo et al., 2012; Bertrand Fowa et al.,2019; Fowa et al., 2019; Garba Koffi et al., 2021). In Ivoriantraditional pharmacopeia, A. lobata is also used to alleviateanemia in children and pregnant women, relieve gingivalinflammation, facilitate labor, and treat malaria fever (N’Goet al., 2021; Florian et al., 2022). In Ghana, it is used to treatdiabetes mellitus (Sarkodie et al., 2013), while in some easterncommunities of Nigeria, the plant extracts are used for rheumaticpain, headaches, abdominal pain, and cancer (N’Go et al., 2021).Moreover, the plant is recognized for its antihyperglycemic andantioxidant properties (Bertrand Fowa et al., 2019; Fowaet al., 2019).A. trilobata, locally referred to as akandaphal in Bangladesh, isdistributed in the Chittagong district, as well as in Assam, Pakistan,Myanmar, and the western and eastern Himalayas (Barua et al.,2020). Traditionally, it is used in Bangladesh (South Asia) forvarious herbal treatments, particularly for diabetes, arthritis,toxicity, and other age-related diseases (Islam et al., 2022). Thepoultice made from its leaves is applied to alleviate headaches,stomach issues, knee pain, and snake bites (Aziz et al., 2020;Barua et al., 2020).A. glauca, commonly referred to as “Elephant foot,” is aclimbing, tuberous, perennial shrub native to the dry bushveld ofsouthern Africa (Immaculate et al., 2022; 2023). This plant isprimarily found in rocky areas and has been noted to bepoisonous to cattle; however, children in Africa have beenobserved to consume the fruit without adverse effects (Spencer K.C. and Seigler D. S., 1982). The leaves at the plant’s base arecyanogenic, while the tuber is non-cyanogenic and considerednon-poisonous (Spencer K. C. and Seigler D. S., 1982).Traditionally, the powdered form of A. glauca has been utilizedto treat various medical conditions, including ear infections, swollenlegs, and skin diseases. The preparation typically involves grindingthe plant material into a powder, which is then applied as a topicaltreatment (Immaculate et al., 2023). Furthermore, the plant isknown to contain galactose-binding lectins and extracts that areuseful for protein synthesis and hemagglutinating activity,highlighting its potential as a therapeutic resource (Immaculateet al., 2022).A. volkensii is a perennial shrub found growing wild in severalregions of Kenya. The plant is particularly noted for its hightoxicity and is traditionally used to kill hyenas, which is reflectedin its local Kamba name “kiliambiti,” meaning “eater of hyenas”FIGURE 5Fatty Acid and polyacetylene from Adenia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659(Gondwe et al., 1978; Barbieri et al., 1984). Documented cases ofpoisoning have been reported in Kenya, where individualsbecame ill after consuming a local gruel that was reportedlycontaminated with an extract of A. volkensii (Gondweet al., 1978).A. digitata, commonly known as Modecca, is a tuberous,perennial shrub that thrives in dry regions of South Africa. Boththe tuber and fruit are known to be highly toxic to humans, withcases of death reported following accidental, suicidal, or homicidalingestion (Spencer K. C. and Seigler D. S., 1982).A. panduriformis is a woody climber plant primarily found inZambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. It could thrive insimilar climatic conditions elsewhere in the world.The plant is a wild vegetable that is commonly consumed as partof the daily diet in various Zambia communities. It is also utilized intraditional medicine to treat and manage a range of diseases, such asdegenerative conditions. Traditional healers often prescribe A.panduriformis to patients with weakened immune systems,including those living with HIV/AIDS, as it is believed to be anexcellent immune booster. Additionally, this leafy vegetable isclaimed to have healing properties for several ailments, includingdiabetes, hypertension, malaria, and diarrhea (Chibuye et al., 2024).A. wightiana is a tuberous, perennial liana characterized byaxillary, branched tendrils. It is widely recognized in folk medicinefor its medicinal properties, particularly in treating ailments likepeptic ulcers. The leaves of this plant are also consumed as aFIGURE 6Main volatile chemical constituents found in Adenia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659TABLE 2 Pharmacological Importance of the genus Adenia.Species PharmacologicalactivityPart uses Tested extract Model Control DosagerangeResults/effects ReferencesA. gummifera var.gummiferaAntibacterial Leaves, stem bark Aqueous In vitro - 5.0 mg/mL Active against Enterobactercloacae, Escherichia coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Klebsiella pneumoniae, andSerratia marcescensRotich (2022)Antifungal Root bark Aqueous/ethanol In vitro (ZOI/MIC) - - Active against Candida albicansand Rhodotorula spp (ZOI =10–37 mm; MIC =61.0–72 mg/mL)Maroyi, 2020; Rotich,2022Antiplasmodial Roots, leaves Petroleum ether/ethylacetate (1:1)In vitro (IC50) Chloroquine 50 mg/mL Active against PoW strain (IC50 =50 μg/mL) and none active againstchloroquine-resistant cloneDd2 strainKraft et al.

Its extracts show potential in managingconditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer’sdisease. The edible parts of A. viridiflora include the leaves, flowers,young fruits, and shoots which are typically fermented or blanchedusing washing rice water and served with a spicy sauce as a vegetableaccompaniment (Wannasaksri et al., 2021a).A. globosa Engl. is also used traditionally in Kenya, where freshlyprepared juice from the tuber is administered to cattle, cows, andgoats to facilitate and expedite parturition, particularly for thoseexperiencing difficulties during delivery (Sinei and Mwangi, 1995;Sinei, and Mwangi, 2015). Additionally, an infusion made from thistuber has been shown to induce dose-dependent contractions of therat uterus, further supporting its traditional use in promoting fasterparturition in domestic animals (Gruber and OʼBrien, 2011).3.3 PhytochemistryAdenia species are also known for their rich phytochemicalprofile. These plants contain a diverse array of secondarymetabolites that have been explored for their medicinalproperties. Phytochemical studies on different species of Adeniasuch as A. cissampeloides, A. gummifera, A. lobate, A. panduriformis,A. trilobata, and A. volkensii have revealed a variety of compoundclasses. These include alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols,steroids, terpenoids, polyphenols, saponins, carbohydrates,proanthocyanins, glycosides, and even potentially toxic proteinslike type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) (Gondwe et al.,1978; Severino et al., 2009; Okem et al., 2014; Bertrand Fowa et al.,2019; Ogunlesi et al., 2019; Barua et al., 2020; Maroyi, 2020; Rotich,2022; Chibuye et al., 2024). The investigation of some of thesespecies led to the isolation of 27 compounds belonging to differentclasses. These include six cyanohydrin glycosides, one alkaloid, oneceramide, six flavonoids, three steroids, one triterpene, two fattyacids, one polyacetylene, and six type 2 RIPs. In addition,17 compounds were found in the essential oils obtained from A.cissampeloides leaves. Furthermore, some heavy metals includingaluminum, chromium, cadmium, copper, iron, manganese, lead,nickel, mercury, zinc, and tin were also found in an Adenia species(A. gummifera) (Rotich, 2022).3.3.1 Cyanohydrin glycosides, alkaloidand ceramideCyanohydrin glycosides are unique plant compounds defined bya cyanohydrin group attached to a sugar moiety, forming aglycosylated structure. These compounds originate from aminoacids and are crucial for plant defense, particularly againstherbivores, as they can release toxic hydrogen cyanide whenhydrolysed enzymatically (Jørgensen et al., 2011; Gleadow andMøller, 2014). The biosynthesis of cyanohydrin glycosidesinvolves several enzymatic steps, primarily catalysed bycytochrome P450 enzymes. The process typically begins with theconversion of amino acids into oximes, which are then transformedinto cyanohydrins through the action of specific enzymes (Jørgensenet al., 2011; Gleadow and Møller, 2014). Alkaloids are a diversegroup of naturally occurring organic compounds that primarilycontain basic nitrogen atoms. Six cyanohydrin glycosides wereisolated from the Adenia genus (Figure 2). These includetetraphyllin A (1) and deidaclin (2) isolated from A. globosa(Sinei and Mwangi, 1995), volkenin (3) from A. volkensii roots(Jaroszewski et al., 1987), tetraphyllin B (4) and epi-tetraphyllin B(5) from the fresh tubers of A. digitate, A. volkensii, and A. glauca(Gondwe et al., 1978; Spencer K. C. and Seigler D. S., 1982;Jaroszewski et al., 1987). Compound (4) was also isolated fromthe roots of A. cissampeloides (Ogunlesi et al., 2019). Importantly,(Jaroszewski et al. (1987) demonstrated compounds (3) and (3) canbe converted into (1R,4R)- (7) and (1S,4S)-1-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentene-1-carboxamides(7) respectively, through a series of reactions, including alkalinehydrolysis and spontaneous lactonization in methanol (Jaroszewskiet al., 1987). Another cyanohydrin glycoside is N-Acetylgalactosamine (8) isolated from A. hondala (Sharma et al., 2018).However, brucine (9), isolated from the leaves of A. lobata, is theonly alkaloid reported from the genus (Agoreyo et al., 2012). At thesame time, adeniamide (10) was the only ceramide isolated from thestem bark of A. lobata (Garba Koffi et al., 2021).3.3.2 FlavonoidsFlavonoids represent a diverse group of natural polyphenoliccompounds with a basic structure of 2-phenyl-benzopyran,consisting of two aromatic rings (A and B) linked by aheterocyclic pyran ring (C) containing an oxygen atom (FalconeFerreyra et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2018; Liga et al., 2023). Glycosylflavonoids are bonded to sugar molecules, enhancing their solubilityand bioavailability (Liga et al., 2023). The flavonoid biosynthesisoccurs through the phenylpropanoid pathway, starting withphenylalanine. Key enzymatic steps include the transformation ofphenylalanine into trans-cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), followed by its transformation into 4-coumaric acidand then into 4-coumaroyl-CoA. Chalcone synthase catalyses thecondensation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to producechalcone, which can be further modified into various flavonoidsubclasses (Falcone Ferreyra et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2018; Liga et al.,2023). Glycosylation occurs via glycosyltransferases, attaching sugarmoieties to the flavonoid backbone, resulting in glycosyl flavonoidswith distinct biological activities (Falcone Ferreyra et al., 2012). Onlysix glycosyl flavonoids have been isolated from the genus Adenia(Figure 3). These include Rutin (11) isolated from A. glauca roots(Immaculate et al., 2022), vitexin (12), 2″-xylosylvitexin (13), and amixture of vicenin-2 (14), violanthin (15), and schaftoside (16)isolated from the leaves of A. mannii (Ulubelen and Oksuz, 1983).3.3.3 Steroids and triterpenesSteroids are organic compounds defined by a core structure offour fused carbon rings, known as the steroid nucleus. Theirbiosynthesis primarily derives from cholesterol through themevalonate pathway, which begins with acetyl-CoA converting tomevalonic acid via HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonic acid is thentransformed into isoprenoid units and assembled into squalene,which undergoes cyclization to form lanosterol. This precursor isfurther modified to produce various steroid hormones (Harrison,1985). Triterpenes, composed of six isoprene units and resulting in aFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.158165930-carbon skeleton, are synthesized via the same mevalonatepathway. The process starts with the formation of isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) from acetyl-CoA, followed by thecondensation of IPP units into squalene. Specific enzymes, suchas oxidosqualene cyclases, then catalyze the cyclization of squalene,yielding diverse triterpenoid structures (Harrison, 1985; Lu et al.,2024). These compound classes are extensively found in plants andare recognised for their various biological activities. From Adeniaspecies, three steroids have been isolated (Figure 4). These include β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (17) and a mixture ofstigmasterol (18) and β-sitosterol (19) isolated from A. lobatastem bark. Whereas, only one triterpene, germanicol caffeoylester (20), has been isolated from A. lobata stem bark (GarbaKoffi et al., 2021).3.3.4 Fatty acid and polyacetyleneFatty acids are long-chain carboxylic acids, either saturated orunsaturated, crucial for energy storage, cellular structure, andsignaling in organisms. Their synthesis mainly occurs via thefatty acid synthase (FAS) complex, beginning with acetyl-CoA,which is converted to malonyl-CoA and then condensed into a3-ketoacyl-ACP intermediate. This intermediate undergoesreduction and dehydration, producing saturated fatty acids, withelongation processes resulting in common fatty acids like palmiticand stearic acid (Minto and Blacklock, 2008; Scott et al., 2022;Salomon, 2024). Polyacetylenes, known for their carbon-carbontriple bonds, are derived from fatty acid precursors such ascrepenynic and stearolic acids. Their biosynthesis includesdesaturation of fatty acids and the formation of acetylenic bondsthrough oxidative dehydrogenation or decarboxylative enolelimination, leading to diverse polyacetylene derivatives (Mintoand Blacklock, 2008; Scott et al., 2022; Salomon, 2024). FromAdenia species only two fatty acids are reported, includingoctacosanoic acid (21) and D-mannitol (22) isolated from A.lobata stem bark (Figure 5) (Garba Koffi et al., 2021). Whereasgummiferol (23) is the only polyacetylene isolated from A.gummifera leaves (Fullas et al., 1995; Luman, F.M., andMottram, 2006).3.3.5 Essential oilsEssential oils (EOs) are concentrated, hydrophobic liquidsderived from plants, known for their strong aromas, andcomposed mainly of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.Typically, EOs contain 20 to 60 components, with two orthree major constituents making up 20%–70% of the mixture(Rashidinejad and Jafari, 2020; Santos et al., 2022). Theirchemical composition can vary significantly due to factorssuch as season, climate, water stress, geographic location, soilconditions, and other abiotic influences. In 2019, Ogunlesi andcollaborators analysed the EOs from A. cissampeloidesdriedleaves. They found a total of 17 constituents from fiveessential derived from the species. These include phytol,germacrene D, n-hexadecanoic acid, α-linolenic acid, 1,13-tridecanediol, diacetate, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, kaur-16-ene, (13S)-8,13-epoxy-labd-14-ene, guaiol, α-elemene, α-gurjunene, α-humulene, myrtenol, camphene, azulene, andcubebene (Figure 6). The major compound in the EO sampleswas phytol, with other notable constituents including germacreneD, diacetate, and 1,13-tridecanediol which were predominant inthe first and second hours of collection, respectively (Ogunlesiet al., 2019).3.3.6 Type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs)RIPs are a class of enzymes primarily derived from plants thatcan inhibit protein synthesis by targeting eukaryotic ribosomes.They are categorized into three main types: type I RIPs, which aresingle-chain proteins; type II RIPs, which consist of an A-chain anda B-chain; and type III RIPs, which are less common and haveadditional domains (Stirpe et al., 2007; Bortolotti et al., 2021; 2024;Maiello et al., 2021). Type 2 RIPs, mostly isolated from the Adeniagenus, are responsible for binding to cell surface receptors and thenhighly cytotoxic, making them of interest for both therapeutic andresearch applications. These proteins are purified by using AffinityChromatography and Gel Filtration techniques and characterized byusing SDS/PAGE and ESI-MS techniques (Barbieri et al., 1980;Chambery et al., 2004; Severino et al., 2009; Tosi et al., 2009;Mercatelli et al., 2020; Bortolotti et al., 2021; Bortolotti et al.,2024). Type 2 RIPs from Adenia species include modeccin,isolated from A. digitata and A. volkensii roots. This toxin is aprotein with a molecular weight of 57,000, which can dissociatedinto two subunits weighing 25,000 and 32,000 (Gasperi-campaniet al., 1978; Barbieri et al., 1980; Bortolotti et al., 2021; Bortolottiet al., 2024). Another type 2 RIP from Adenia species, is volkensin,also isolated from the roots of A. volkensii, with a molecular weightof 60,000. The A-chain has a molecular weight of 29,000, while theB-chain displays double molecular weights of 37,400 and 36,000(Chambery et al., 2004; Severino et al., 2009). Volkensin hasadditionally been extracted from A. digitate roots (Bortolottiet al., 2024) and from the caudex of A. kirkii (Bortolotti et al.,2021). Stenodactylin is isolated from the caudex of A. stenodactyla,consisting of two chains connected by a disulfide bond. The A-chainacts on 28S rRNA, while the B-chain binds to glycan structures. Itsmolecular weight is 53,800, reduced into two bands of 24,800 and30,000 for the A and B chains respectively (Stirpe et al., 2007; Tosiet al., 2009; Mercatelli et al., 2020; Bortolotti et al., 2024). Thisprotein was characterized through crystallization and X-raydiffraction, resulting in crystals that diffract at high resolution,reaching up to 2.15 Å (Tosi et al., 2009). Lanceolin, isolated fromthe caudex of A. lanceolata, has a molecular weight of 63,000, with Aand B chains ranging from 27,000 to 33,400 (Stirpe et al., 2007;Bortolotti et al., 2021; 2024). Kirkiin, derived from the caudex of A.kirkii, has an approximate molecular weight of 58.5 kDa, whichreduces to bands of 27.1 kDa and 35.3 kDa (Bortolotti et al., 2021;2024). Lastly, heterophyllin from the caudex of A. heterophyllacorresponds to 60 kDa under non-reducing conditions andreduces to bands of about 25 kDa and 33 kDa (Bortolottiet al., 2024).3.4 Pharmacological properties of AdeniaThe pharmacological properties of Adenia species highlighttheir potential for therapeutic applications, includingantimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic,anticholinesterase, neuropharmacological, antidepressant,antihyperglycaemic, anti-anemic, anticoagulant, antithrombotic,Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659thrombolytic, and anesthetic, uterine contraction, and cytotoxicityactivities (Table 2).3.4.1 Antimicrobial activitiesaaaaaAdenia species exhibit notable antimicrobial properties,supported by multiple studies. A. gummifera demonstrates broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-negative pathogenslike Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae using acetoneextracts (5.0 mg/mL) (Rotich, 2022), while its ethanol andaqueous root bark extracts show strong antifungal effectsagainst Candida albicans (37.0 mm inhibition zones) (Maroyi,2020; Rotich, 2022). These activities are linked to flavonoids,alkaloids, and ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) that disruptmicrobial membranes, DNA synthesis, and protein synthesis(Tosi et al., 2009; Battelli et al., 2010). Although A. gummiferaexhibits moderate antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 50 μg/mL), it lacksefficacy against resistant strains (Kraft et al., 2003). Incontrast, A. lobata’s hydroethanolic leaf extract clearsSalmonella typhi infections in rats within 8–12 days (Fowaet al., 2019) and inhibits TEM-1 β-lactamase by 90%,suggesting potential to counter antibiotic resistance (Gangoué-Piéboji et al., 2007). Its ethyl acetate stem bark fraction and apurified compound (20) (IC50 = 6.03 μg/mL) show potentantileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani,outperforming less effective methanol extracts (Garba Koffiet al., 2021; Okpekon et al., 2004). Structure-activityrelationships highlight hydroxyl/acetyl groups and nitrogen-containing alkaloids as key drivers of efficacy (Gangoué-Piéboji et al., 2007; Garba Koffi et al., 2021). In addition, A.trilobata stands out for its gastrointestinal benefits: methanol leafextracts (200–400 mg/kg) significantly reduced diarrhea episodesand intestinal motility in mice, with the 400 mg/kg doseoutperforming the standard drug loperamide in motilityinhibition—a promising finding for natural antidiarrhealagents (Barua et al., 2020). Meanwhile, A. cissampeloidesshows dual antimicrobial potential. Its petroleum ether extracteffectively combats fish pathogens like Aeromonas veronii(8.2 mm inhibition zones), while methanol extracts targetRaoutella ornithinolytica (7 mm zones), offering potentialsolutions for aquaculture-related bacterial infections (Uzoetoet al., 2018). Notably, the same species exhibits moderateantiplasmodial activity against drug-resistant P. falciparum,achieving 73.95% parasite growth inhibition at lowconcentrations (1.562 μg/mL), though its IC50 (8.521 μg/mL)remains far higher than artesunate’s 0.03 μg/mL benchmark(Annan et al., 2012). Together, these findings position Adeniaas a multi-target medicinal resource—from gut health to malariamanagement—with efficacy often rivalling synthetic drugs,though potency gaps for specific applications warrant furtherresearch into compound optimization. They underscore Adenia’spotential as a source of novel antimicrobial agents, particularlyfor drug-resistant infections.3.4.2 Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, andnutritional propertiesAdenia species offer a compelling array of antioxidant benefits,as evidenced by extensive research. A. lobata stands out, with studiesdetailing its ability to modulate oxidative stress in vivo. For example,a hydroethanolic leaf extract administered to S. typhi-infected ratssignificantly reduced malondialdehyde levels while boosting crucialantioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, glutathione,catalase, and nitric oxide (Fowa et al., 2019). In vitro analyses ofA. lobata stem extracts revealed that ethanol extracts outperformpetroleum ether in multiple antioxidant assays, displaying a totalphenolic content of 0.623 mg/g, a total antioxidant capacity of0.687 mg/g, and a reducing power of 0.645 mg/g (Sarkodie et al.,2013). The ethanol extract also exhibited lower IC50 values in DPPHscavenging (0.5210 mg/mL) and lipid autoxidation inhibition(0.5985 mg/mL) assays compared to the petroleum ether extract(Sarkodie et al., 2013). Furthermore, an ethyl acetate fraction fromthe cordate leaf variety of A. lobata showed exceptional antioxidantactivity (63.87%), suggesting its potential in cancer therapy(Agoreyo et al., 2012). A. lobata’s antioxidant potential extendsto neuroprotection, reducing pain and anxiety in mice, effects linkedto decreased levels of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde andincreased levels of non-protein thiols (N’Go et al., 2021). OtherAdenia species also demonstrate impressive antioxidant capabilities.A. gummifera stem methanol extracts exhibited a reducing ability of159.12 mm Fe (II)/g and acted as potent ABTS radical scavengers,with activity comparable to the synthetic antioxidant BHT (94.2%inhibition for A. gummifera vs. 96.8% for BHT at 0.08 mg/mL)(Adedapo et al., 2008). A. trilobata n-hexane leaf fractions displayedthe highest scavenging activity (89.19% at 500 μg/mL, IC50 =139.65 μg/mL) (Barua et al., 2020), while A. panduriformis leafmethanol extracts even surpassed ascorbic acid in DPPH free radicalquenching (IC50 = 53.48 μg/mL vs. 74.47 μg/mL) (Chibuye et al.,2024). In A. viridiflora, older leaves exhibited higher DPPHscavenging (0.96–1.44 μmol TE/100 g DW) and FRAP activities(27.08–42.90 μmol TE/g DW) compared to younger shoots(Wannasaksri et al., 2021b), suggesting an age-relatedaccumulation of protective compounds. Finally, a compoundisolated from A. glauca demonstrated notable free radicalscavenging, with an IC50 value of 51.56 μg/mL in the DPPHassay (Immaculate et al., 2022). These antioxidant activities areprimarily attributed to flavonoids and phenolic compounds, whichneutralize free radicals and boost antioxidant enzymes like SOD andglutathione peroxidase (Sarkodie et al., 2013). Variations in activityamong extracts from different species such as A. trilobata, A.gummifera, A. panduriformis, and A. viridiflora are linked to thespecific antioxidants extracted by different solvents (n-hexane vs.methanol) and the accumulation of compounds like flavonoids andtannins as leaves mature (Adedapo et al., 2008; Barua et al., 2020;Chibuye et al., 2024; Wannasaksri et al., 2021b). These antioxidantproperties contribute to antinociceptive and anti-anxiety effects bymitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in neuronal tissues, asdemonstrated in studies with A. lobata (N’Go et al., 2021).Thesecollective findings underscore the significant potential of Adeniaspecies as a source of natural antioxidants for various therapeuticapplications, offering a promising avenue for further investigationand development.Furthermore, the nutritional compositions of old leaves andyoung shoots from A. viridiflora were studied using samplescollected from four regions of Thailand during various periods(March-April, May-June, and July-August). The young shootsprovided 371.45–387.69 kcal of energy and containedFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.158165918.15–21.94 g of protein, while old leaves offered 373.22–386.97 kcaland 16.53–22.68 g of protein, generally showing higher protein levelsin young shoots, particularly during May-June. In terms of fatcontent, young shoots ranged from 0.62 to 4.10 g, compared to1.66–3.28 g in old leaves. Both parts had similar carbohydratecontents (67.21–74.57 g in young shoots and 67.12–73.53 g inold leaves), but young shoots contained significantly more totaldietary fiber (32.89–65.26 g) than old leaves (28.37–51.46 g),especially in samples from July-August. Young shoots had totalsugar levels of 8.45–16.16 g, while old leaves contained11.83–18.22 g, with old leaves generally exhibiting higher sugarcontent. Vitamin C levels were notable, with young shoots rangingfrom 573.93 to 1696.46 mg and old leaves from 862.64 to2240.65 mg, the latter providing 1.1–1.9 times more. Lutein wasthe predominant carotenoid in both parts, with old leaves havingsignificantly higher levels of both β-carotene (1.7–3.6 times) andlutein (1.4–2.6 times). In terms of minerals, potassium was mostabundant, with young shoots containing 1740.09–2549.33 mg andold leaves 1357.16–2144.11 mg, while old leaves showed slightlyhigher iron content (4.90–8.57 mg versus 4.27–7.08 mg in youngshoots). Overall, young shoots offered higher energy, protein, andfat, while old leaves provided greater antioxidant activities, phenoliccontent, and specific vitamins and minerals, highlighting the uniquenutritional benefits of both plant parts (Wannasaksri et al., 2021b).A. viridiflora offers nutritional benefits, with young shoots rich inprotein and fiber and old leaves packed with vitamin C andcarotenoids like lutein and β-carotene for antioxidant protection.These nutritional differences arise from the plant’s growth stages,with young shoots focusing on building new tissues and older leavesaccumulating protective compounds against environmentalstressors (Wannasaksri et al., 2021b). The presence of thesevitamins, carotenoids, and essential minerals contributes tooverall human health by supporting immune function, eyehealth, and cellular balance (Wannasaksri et al., 2021b).3.4.3 Analgesic, anticholinesterase,neuropharmacological, and antidepressantactivitiesAdenia species showcase significant neuropharmacologicalpotential, offering hope for novel treatments in painmanagement, anxiety, and depression. A. trilobata extracts havedemonstrated analgesic effects, with amethanol leaf extract reducingwrithing by 57.85% in acetic acid-induced writhing tests andsignificantly inhibiting formalin-induced licking in mice (Baruaet al., 2020). These effects are potentially mediated by flavonoidsand terpenoids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory andpain-relieving properties. In addition to pain relief, A. trilobataexhibits anxiolytic and antidepressant-like activities. Studies usingelevated plus mazes, hole-board tests, forced swimming tests, andtail suspension tests in mice revealed that different fractions of A.trilobata extracts could alter behavior, suggesting a modulation ofneurotransmitter systems (Aziz et al., 2020). Specifically, open armentries in the elevated plus maze increased by up to 41.84% withcertain extracts, indicating a reduction in anxiety-like behavior (Azizet al., 2020). In addition, A. cissampeloides has demonstratedpromising antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. A hydroethanolicextract of A. cissampeloides leaves increased swimming activity by75.20% and climbing activity by 190.00% in the forced swimmingtest, comparable to the effects of imipramine, a standardantidepressant (Ishola et al., 2015). The extract also showedanxiolytic effects by increasing head dips by 41.67% in the hole-board test and enhancing open-arm entries in the elevated plus maze(Ishola et al., 2015). These effects appear to be linked to themodulation of dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergicpathways, as the antidepressant effects were blocked by sulpiride(a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist) and yohimbine (an α2-adrenoceptor antagonist), while the anxiolytic effects werereversed by cyproheptadine (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) (Isholaet al., 2015). Finally, A. gummifera has shown anticholinesteraseactivity, with an IC50 value of 0.02 mg/mL, suggesting potentialbenefits for cognitive function (Adewusi and Steenkamp, 2011).Additionally, steam distillates from A. gummifera exhibitedanesthetic effects on bees (Apis mellifera), likely due to volatileterpenoids interacting with neuronal receptors (Ngarivhume et al.,2008). These diverse neuropharmacological effects suggest thatAdenia species hold considerable promise for the development ofnew treatments for pain, anxiety, depression, and cognitivedisorders, and warrant further investigation to isolate andcharacterize the active compounds responsible for these effects.3.4.4 Antihyperglycaemic and anti-anemicactivitiesAdenia species showcase potential in managing diabetes andanemia and demonstrate diverse antioxidant activity. A. lobata stemextracts significantly reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic rats,with the 70% ethanol extract showing up to 82.8% reduction, likelydue to flavonoids and phenolics that enhance insulin sensitivity(Sarkodie et al., 2013). Flavonoids’ structure allows them to donateelectrons, reducing oxidative stress and promoting ironbioavailability for red blood cell production. Also, A. lobata leafextracts normalized hematological parameters in anemic rats, withthe aqueous extract showing a superior recovery rate of 79.66% at250 mg/kg and increased hemoglobin levels (Florian et al., 2022).Beyond these effects, A. lobata demonstrates significant antioxidantproperties, reducing malondialdehyde while increasing antioxidantenzyme levels in rats (Fowa et al., 2019) and showing potent DPPHscavenging activity, with the ethyl acetate fraction of the cordate leafvariety exhibiting 63.87% activity (Agoreyo et al., 2012). In addition,A. gummifera demonstrated comparable ABTS radical scavengingactivity to BHT (Adedapo et al., 2008), A. trilobata n-hexane leaffraction displayed 89.19% scavenging activity (Barua et al., 2020), A.panduriformis surpassed ascorbic acid in DPPH quenching(Chibuye et al., 2024), and A. glauca compound showed an IC50of 51.56 μg/mL (Immaculate et al., 2022), reinforcing Adenia’spotential as a source of therapeutic agents.3.4.5 Anticoagulant, antithrombotic, andthrombolytic activitiesAdenia species exhibit promising anticoagulant andantithrombotic properties with insights from a mix ofcompounds that promote these effects. An A. cissampeloides andPseudocedrela kotschyi mixture prolonged aPTT and bleeding timein rats, which are both indicators of anticoagulant activity, with noobserved adverse effects below 2000 mg/kg (Nyansah et al., 2016).The same extract also reduced tail infarction and microthrombi in acarrageenan-induced thrombosis model (Nyansah et al., 2021). A.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org16Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659trilobatamethanol stem extract showed thrombolytic activity, lysingclots by 25.58%, though less effectively than streptokinase, which is aknown pharmaceutical agent used to treat blood clots (Barua et al.,2020). Together, the data suggest compounds present in Adeniainteract with coagulation factors which ultimately disrupt normalblood coagulation processes leading to an increase in bleeding timeand reduced clot formation. Furthermore, this body of researchhighlights several Adenia species are demonstrating diverseneuropharmacological activities, particularly in pain management,anxiety, and depression. This is important as it suggests thatcompounds isolated from the Adenia genus may have atherapeutic effect across multiple targets. For example, A.trilobata showed analgesic effects, reducing writhing by up to57.85% and significantly inhibiting formalin-induced licking,effects that are attributed to flavonoids and terpenoids (Baruaet al., 2020). This same extract had demonstrated anxiolytic andantidepressant-like activities, as evidenced by increased open armentries in animal models of elevated plus maze experiments (up to41.84%) and altered behavior in forced swimming and tailsuspension tests, suggesting neurotransmitter modulation (Azizet al., 2020). Similarly, A. cissampeloides has displayedantidepressant-like activity, increasing swimming activity andclimbing activity and anxiolytic effects, increasing head dips andopen-arm entries, an effect that is linked to dopaminergic,adrenergic, and serotonergic pathways. Finally, A. gummiferadisplayed anticholinesterase activity and anesthetic effects onbees, a reaction that can be attributed to alkaloids and volatileterpenoids (Adewusi and Steenkamp, 2011; Ngarivhume et al.,2008). The culmination of these results highlights an expansivepotential of Adenia species to effectively manage pain, anxiety, anddepression, which has created a basis for further investigation intothese applications.3.4.6 Anesthetic and uterine contraction propertiesThe anesthetic properties of steam distillates from the stem of A.gummifera were assessed using a diffusion method on A. mellifera.Live, direct, and fractional distillates (61°C–80°C) exhibited strongeranesthetic effects, while vacuum distillates were milder. The aqueousstem extract also showed dose-dependent anesthetic effect onAfrican bees, with effectiveness increasing up to a 6.0%concentration, beyond which it plateaued, and excessive exposureproved lethal. Factors such as bee-distillate distance (F2,6 = 5.14;Fcal = 31.0) and container volume (F3,8 = 4.07; Fcal = 66.4)significantly influenced anesthetic activity, indicating that the rateof diffusion of the active components was critical. Thesecomponents likely include amines and halogenated alkanes.Additionally, the leaf extracts of A. gummifera containedgummiferol, a polyacetylene known to be toxic to certain humancancer cell lines (Ngarivhume et al., 2008). The cytotoxicity activityof gummiferol may contribute to the anesthetic effect by disruptingcellular functions in nerve tissues. The SAR of this compoundinvolves its ability to bind to and modulate the activity ofneuronal receptors, leading to the observed anesthetic effects. In2015, Sinei and Mwangi investigated the effects of the aqueousextract of theA. globosa tuber on isolated rat uterus preparations andits interaction with prostaglandin F2α and ergometrine, both knownuterine stimulants. The study found that the plant extract induced adose-dependent contraction of the rat uterus. Notably, small dosesof prostaglandin F2α (2.5 μg/mL) and ergometrine (0.125 μg/mL)significantly enhanced the contractile effects of the extract, with thepresence of prostaglandin F2α increasing the effect (p < 0.02 and p <0.01). Alone, this dose of prostaglandin F2α resulted inapproximately 15% contraction, while ergometrine resulted inapproximately 5% contraction on its own (p < 0.05, p < 0.02,and p < 0.01). These findings indicate a synergistic relationshipbetween the extract and these uterine stimulants (Sinei and Mwangi,2015). The uterine contraction properties of A. globosa are likelymediated by the presence of oxytocic compounds, which canstimulate uterine smooth muscle contraction. The synergisticrelationship with prostaglandin F2α and ergometrine suggeststhat the extract may enhance the sensitivity of uterinereceptors to these stimulants or act through a similar mechanism(Sinei et al., 1994).3.4.7 Cytotoxicity activitiesThe genus Adenia has garnered attention in pharmacologicalresearch due to its bioactive compounds with significant cytotoxicproperties. These include ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs),which exhibit promising activities against cancer cells andneurological targets. These properties could be attributed to theirstrong cell binding, resistance to proteolysis, and efficientendocytosis. These properties enable their retrograde transportalong the central nervous system and peripheral nerves,suggesting potential applications in neurophysiology and ascomponents of immunotoxins for targeted cancer therapy andother treatments (Bortolotti et al., 2021). The cytotoxic activity ofRIPs is primarily due to their ability to inhibit protein synthesis bydepurinating a specific adenine residue in ribosomal RNA, therebydisrupting ribosome function. The structure-activity relationship(SAR) of RIPs is characterized by two key domains: an N-glycosidasedomain responsible for the enzymatic activity and a lectin domainthat facilitates binding to cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids,enabling cellular entry (Bortolotti et al., 2021). The specific aminoacid sequence and glycosylation patterns of these domains influencetheir binding affinity and enzymatic activity, ultimately determiningtheir cytotoxicity. For instance, Monti et al. (2007) examined theimpacts of lanceolin and stenodactylin, two type 2 RIPs from A.lanceolata and A. stenodactyla respectively, on neural cells and theirneurotoxicity in vivo. The concentrations inhibiting 50% proteinsynthesis were measured at 10−11 M and 10−12 M for cerebellargranule neurons, 10−12 M and 10−13 M for astrocytes, and 10−13 M formicroglia. Both RIPs were toxic to glial cells, with microglia beingthe most sensitive, showing 50% cell death at around 10−14 M.Stenodactylin demonstrated high neurotoxicity when injectedintracerebrally and leading to the loss of cholinergic neurons inthe medial septal nucleus following stereotaxic injection of 1.3 ng.The retrograde transport of these RIPs along neurons enablestargeted lesioning experiments and offers potential forimmunolesioning specific neuronal populations (Monti et al.,2007). The differential cytotoxicity of lanceolin and stenodactylintowards different neural cell types highlights the importance ofspecific cell surface receptors and endocytic pathways in mediatingRIP entry and toxicity. In another study, Stirpe et al. (2007)demonstrated that both RIPs demonstrated the ability toagglutinate red blood cells, inhibit protein synthesis in cell-freesystems and whole cells, and depurinate ribosomes and DNA, whileFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org17Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659not affecting tRNA or poly(A). They were found to be highly toxic,inducing apoptosis in cells and exhibiting LD50 values of 8.16 mg/kgfor lanceolin and 2.76 mg/kg for stenodactylin in mice after 48 h(Stirpe et al., 2007). The ability of lanceolin and stenodactylin toagglutinate red blood cells and inhibit protein synthesis underscorestheir potent cytotoxic activity. The lower LD50 value of stenodactylincompared to lanceolin indicates that it is more toxic, possibly due todifferences in their amino acid sequences, glycosylation patterns, orcellular trafficking. In addition, stenodactylin have been proven to bea promising candidate for anticancer therapy due to its ability toinduce apoptosis and necroptosis in treated cells through reactiveoxygen species production. In studies involving Raji and Ramos(human Burkitt’s lymphoma) and MOLM-13 (acute myeloidleukemia) cells, stenodactylin demonstrated significant effects onprotein synthesis and cell viability. After 48 h of exposure to 10−9 Mstenodactylin, protein synthesis was nearly completely inhibitedacross all cell lines, although MOLM-13 cells were the mostsensitive, exhibiting an IC50 of 3.75 × 10−12 M, compared to1.95 × 10−11 M for Raji and 3.49 × 10−11 M for Ramos. Cellviability assays indicated that all cell lines showed similarsensitivity to stenodactylin, with EC50 values of 2.09 × 10−10 M(Raji), 3.43 × 10−10 M (Ramos), and 1.06 × 10−10 M (MOLM-13).Time-course studies revealed a dose-dependent reduction inMOLM-13 cell viability, with significant effects observed after12 h and complete loss by 24 h (Mercatelli et al., 2020).Moreover, stenodactylin-induced rapid activation of apoptoticpathways was confirmed through flow cytometry andmicroscopy, with an IC50 of 4 × 10−14 M and an EC50 of 2.5 ×10−14 M noted after 48 h (Polito et al., 2016). The induction ofapoptosis and necroptosis by stenodactylin in cancer cells, coupledwith its ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), highlightsits potential as an anticancer agent. The variations in IC50 and EC50values across different cell lines suggest that stenodactylin’scytotoxicity is influenced by cellular factors such as theexpression of specific receptors or the activity of antioxidantdefense mechanisms. The rapid activation of apoptotic pathwaysfurther supports its potent cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, in 2010,Battelli et al. evaluated the concentration-response curves forprotein synthesis and cell viability after 24 h of exposure to RIPslanceolin, volkensin, and stenodactylin. They found that lanceolinand volkensin exhibited similar cytotoxicities, while stenodactylinwas two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic. The IC50 values foreach RIP closely coincided with the LC50 values, although a lowpercentage of cell viability remained even after complete inhibitionof protein synthesis, which occurred at 10−12 M for stenodactylin and10−10 M for lanceolin and volkensin. Viability tests indicated that20% of metabolizing cells persisted after 24 h of treatment at theseconcentrations. Complete cell death (100%) was observed only after72 h for both lanceolin and stenodactylin. HeLa cell morphology wasassessed by optical microscopy, revealing significant alterations afterexposure to 10−12 M lanceolin, stenodactylin, or volkensin comparedto control cultures (Battelli et al., 2010). The higher cytotoxicity ofstenodactylin compared to lanceolin and volkensin reinforces thenotion that subtle structural differences among RIPs cansignificantly impact their biological activity. The persistence ofmetabolizing cells even after complete inhibition of proteinsynthesis suggests that cells may activate alternative survivalmechanisms, underscoring the complexity of cellular responses toRIP-induced stress. Volkensin, purified from the roots of A.volkensii, inhibits protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysatesand HeLa cells. It is highly toxic to mice, with an LD50 of 1.38 μg/kgbody weight (Barbieri et al., 1984). The potent toxicity of volkensin,as evidenced by its low LD50 value, underscores its potential as acytotoxic agent. Its ability to inhibit protein synthesis in both cell-free systems and whole cells highlights its broad-spectrum activity.Whereas Gummiferol, a type 2 RIP isolated from the leaves of A.gummifera, exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against the humanepidermoid carcinoma (KB) cell line. The organic portion of a 20%MeOH/CHCl3/H2O partition from a 50% MeOH/CHCl3 extract ofthe leaves demonstrated an ED50 value of 1.1 μg/mL in the kB cellline assay (Fullas et al., 1995; Adedapo et al., 2008). The cytotoxicactivity of gummiferol against the kB cell line suggests that it mayhave potential as an anticancer agent. Its isolation from the organicportion of the extract indicates that it is a relatively non-polarcompound, consistent with the properties of many RIPs.In addition, the cytotoxic effects and the pathways of cell deathinduced by heterophyllin, a type 2 RIP isolated from A. heterophylla,were assessed in three human-derived cell lines: MCF7, NB100, andT24, and compared to ricin (a well-studied type 2 RIP).Heterophyllin was found to entirely eliminate cell viability atnanomolar concentrations, inducing strong apoptosis withoutnecrosis, alongside oxidative stress and necroptosis. Cell viabilitywas assessed after 72 h of incubation using concentration-responseexperiments. Ricin significantly reduced cell viability starting at10−13 M, whereas heterophyllin began to show significant effectsat 10−12 M (T24 and MCF7) and 10−11 M (NB100). The EC50 forheterophyllin was approximately 10−11 M across all cell lines.Complete cell killing occurred at 10−9 M for T24 and NB100 cellsand 10−10 M for MCF7 cells. In contrast, ricin demonstrated highertoxicity with an EC50 of 10−13 M and complete cell killing at 10−11 M.Cytofluorimetric analysis using Annexin V-EGFP/Propidium iodide(PI) staining revealed that after 24 h of exposure to 10−9 Mheterophyllin, over 95% of treated cells were in early or lateapoptosis, with minimal necrosis observed. The cytotoxicity ofheterophyllin (10−9 M) and ricin (10−11 M) was evaluated after24 h, showing that both scavengers and cell death inhibitorssignificantly increased cell survival (p < 0.0001) in all tested celllines. In NB100 cells, pre-treatment with scavengers/inhibitorsoffered greater protection against heterophyllin than ricin.Conversely, in T24 and MCF7 cells, pre-treatment was moreeffective for ricin than for heterophyllin, particularly inMCF7 cells (Bortolotti et al., 2024). The distinct effects ofheterophyllin and ricin on cell viability and the varying degreesof protection conferred by scavengers and cell death inhibitorsacross different cell lines highlight the complexity of RIP-inducedcytotoxicity. The induction of apoptosis without necrosis byheterophyllin suggests a specific mechanism of action distinctfrom ricin, possibly involving different intracellular targets orsignaling pathways. The higher sensitivity of NB100 cells toheterophyllin compared to ricin may be related to differences incell surface receptors or endocytic pathways, while the oppositetrend in T24 and MCF7 cells suggests that these cell lines are moresusceptible to ricin’s mechanism of action.Furthermore, the effects of crude extracts from A. racemosa,A. fruticosa, A. venenata, A. keramanthus, A. glauca, and A.lanceolata on protein synthesis were assessed using rabbitFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org18Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659reticulocyte lysates, HeLa, and Raji cell lines. Hemagglutinatingactivity was also assessed with normal human erythrocytes(group O, Rh+). The results revealed that, the extracts from A.racemosa, A. fruticosa, and A. venenata exhibited low inhibitoryactivity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.5 to 36 mg/mL. While,extracts from A. goetzii, A. lanceolata, and A. stenodactyla werehighly potent, with IC50 values below 1 ng/mL to less than 10 ng/mL. Most extracts, except those from A. keramanthus, A. glauca,and A. lanceolata, demonstrated hemagglutinating activity,particularly strong in A. goetzii, A. ellenbeckii, and A.racemosa. Agglutination was inhibited by 0.2 M galactose inall cases (Pelosi et al., 2005). The varying potencies of crudeextracts from different Adenia species in inhibiting proteinsynthesis and inducing hemagglutination reflect differences intheir RIP content and lectin profiles. The high inhibitory activityof extracts from A. goetzii, A. lanceolata, and A. stenodactylasuggests that these species are rich in potent RIPs. Thehemagglutinating activity of most extracts, particularly thosefrom A. goetzii, A. ellenbeckii, and A. racemosa, indicates thepresence of lectins capable of binding to erythrocytes. Theinhibition of agglutination by galactose suggests that theselectins recognize galactose-containing glycans on theerythrocyte surface. AHL, a single lectin B chain isolated fromA. hondala roots, is consider as a human blood group non-specific lectin that agglutinates rabbit erythrocytes. Glycan arrayanalysis revealed that AHL has the greatest affinity for terminallactosamine or polylactosamine of N-glycans, which areoverexpressed in colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.AHL displayed strong binding to human hepatocellularcarcinoma HepG2 cells, with a mean fluorescence intensity(MFI) of 59.1, which was effectively blocked by 93.1% byasialofetuin. It also exhibited dose- and time-dependentgrowth inhibitory effects on HepG2 cells, with an IC50 of4.8 μg/mL at 72 h. Specifically, AHL (at 10 μg/mL) inhibitedHepG2 cell growth by 43% (n = 6, P < 0.01) at 48 h and 76% (n =6, P < 0.001) at 72 h (Sharma et al., 2018). Additionally, in2021 Inamdar et al. assessed the interaction of AHL with humancolon cancer epithelial HT-29 cells and colon cancer tissues. Forthat, the cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, whilecell surface binding, apoptosis, and ROS production wereanalysed by flow cytometry with the Annexin-V-PI andDCFDA kits. Immunohistochemistry utilised biotinylatedAHL, and protein purification was conducted via affinitychromatography with asialofetuin-coupled Sepharose-4B.Their results showed that, AHL demonstrated strong bindingto HT-29 cells, with a Mean Fluorescence Intensity of 12.4, whichwas inhibited by asialofetuin. It reduced HT-29 cell growth in adose- and time-dependent manner, yielding an IC50 of 2.5 μg/mL, and showed differential binding to normal and canceroushuman tissues. AHL induced apoptosis, with early apoptoticpopulations increasing to 25.1% and 36% at 24 h and 48 h,respectively, and necrotic populations at 1.5% and 4.6%.Moreover, AHL triggered the release of Reactive OxygenSpecies in a dose-dependent manner (Inamdar et al., 2021).The preferential binding of AHL to lactosamine orpolylactosamine of N-glycans, which are overexpressed incolon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, suggests that itmay have potential as a targeted therapeutic agent for thesecancers. The dose- and time-dependent growth inhibitory effectsof AHL on HepG2 and HT-29 cells, coupled with its ability toinduce apoptosis and ROS production, further support itspotential as an anticancer agent. The differential binding ofAHL to normal and cancerous human tissues suggests that itcan selectively target cancer cells while sparing normal cells,reducing the risk of toxicity.3.5 Toxicity and safetyThe toxicity of A. cissampeloides has been extensively studied,particularly regarding its effects on catfish larvae and juveniles. Themethanol extract of the stem was tested under static bioassayconditions for 96 h, revealing various pathological changes in fishlarvae, including erratic swimming, moribund behavior,depigmentation, and mortality at concentrations of 25, 50, 75,and 100 mg/L. The lethal concentration for 50% mortality (LC50)was determined to be 50 mg/L within 72 h, indicating high toxicityto catfish juveniles (Agbor and Okoi, 2014). In a separate study,Ibiam et al. (2015) evaluated the acute toxicity of stem-bark aqueousextract of A. cissampeloides in Clarias batrachus juveniles. The studyinvolved 144 fish randomized into groups exposed to varyingconcentrations (0.0, 1.25, 2.50, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 g/L) for 72 h.The calculated LC50 values were 5.0 g/L at 24 h and 2.5 g/L at both48 and 72 h, demonstrating a time and concentration-dependenttoxic effect. Significant (P > 0.05) increases in aspartateaminotransferase (AST) activity and other biochemicalparameters were noted, highlighting the acute toxicity of theextract (Ibiam et al., 2015). Further research by Ekpo et al.(2017) assessed the acute toxicity of the leaf 70% ethanol extractofA. cissampeloides on early developmental stages of farmed Africancatfish, with 160 fingerlings exposed to concentrations of 25, 50, and100 mg/L for 24–96 h. The study found a significant increase inmortality that was dependent on the dose, with an LC50 of 42.38 mg/L for 96 h, indicating acute toxic effects on the fish (Ekpo et al.,2017). Another study involving 370 catfish (Clarias gariepinus)examined the effects of varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75,100 mg/L) of the leaf extract of A. cissampeloides over differentdurations (24, 48, 72, and 96 h). Results showed that bothconcentration and exposure duration significantly (p < 0.05)affected mortality rates, with the highest mortality observed atthe highest concentration and longest exposure time (Uno et al.,2018). The toxicity of A. cissampeloides in fish is likely due to thepresence of toxic compounds such as saponins, alkaloids, andcyanogenic glycosides. Saponins can disrupt cell membranes,leading to hemolysis and tissue damage, while alkaloids caninterfere with neuronal function and cause paralysis. Cyanogenicglycosides release cyanide upon hydrolysis, inhibiting cellularrespiration and causing asphyxiation. The SAR of thesecompounds involves their ability to interact with cellular targets,disrupting normal physiological processes and leading to toxicity.The concentration- and time-dependent effects observed in thesestudies underscore the importance of dose and duration of exposurein determining the severity of toxicity. In contrast, a study evaluatedthe therapeutic and potential toxic effects of an aqueous extract of A.cissampeloides in seven female hypertensive subjects undergoingtreatment and seven matched controls who had not yet started theFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org19Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659treatment. Diastolic and systolic blood pressures were measured,and serum levels of various enzymes, including creatine kinase (CK),α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were analysed toassess the extract’s effectiveness as an antihypertensive agent. Theresults showed that systolic blood pressure was significantly reducedin subjects taking A. cissampeloides compared to controls (p < 0.01).Although CK and HBDH levels were reduced in the treatmentgroup, these differences did not reach statistical significance.Additionally, conjugated and total bilirubin levels were significantlyreduced in the subjects on A. cissampeloides (p < 0.05). The findingssuggest that the plant preparation does not exhibit hepatotoxic ornephrotoxic effects (Nyarko and Addy, 1990). The lack of hepatotoxicor nephrotoxic effects observed in hypertensive subjects treated withA. cissampeloides aqueous extract suggests that the toxic compoundspresent in the plantmay be poorly absorbed or rapidlymetabolized, orthat the concentration of these compounds in the aqueous extract isbelow the threshold for toxicity. The reduction in systolic bloodpressure may be due to the presence of compounds that act asvasodilators or ACE inhibitors. However, it is important to notethat this study involved a small sample size and further research isneeded to confirm these findings and to assess the long-term safety ofA. cissampeloides in humans. In 2020, Barua et al. investigated thelethality of the A. trilobata stems and leaves methanol extracts, as wellas their n-hexane fractions, using the brine shrimp (Artemia salina)bioassay. They found that none of the extracts demonstrated toxicitywhen compared to vincristine sulfate (2.16 μg/mL), the positivecontrol. The results indicated that the methanol stem extract had amoderately toxic effect, with an LC50 of 328 μg/mL, while then-hexane leaf fraction exhibited weak toxicity, with an LC50 of616.85 μg/mL (Barua et al., 2020). The moderate toxicity of themethanol stem extract and the weak toxicity of the n-hexane leaffraction from A. trilobata in the brine shrimp bioassay suggest thatthese extracts contain relatively low concentrations of toxiccompounds. The differences in toxicity between the methanol andn-hexane extracts may be due to the presence of different classes ofcompounds with varying degrees of toxicity.Volkensin, a type 2 RIP derived from the roots of A. volkensii, is ahighly toxic protein with a LD50 for rats reported to be between 50 and60 ng/kg. It is closely related to other well-known toxins such as abrinand ricin, which have been recognized since the late 20th century(Stirpe et al., 1985; Chambery et al., 2004; Chambery et al., 2007;Severino et al., 2009). In experimental settings, the toxicity of volkensinhas been evaluated in male Swiss mice, where it was administeredintraperitoneally at varying doses (0.1–10 µg per 100 g body weight)dissolved in saline. This method of administration allows for theassessment of its lethal effects in a controlled environment (Barbieriet al., 1984). In addition, modeccin, another toxin purified from theroots of A. digitata, has been studied for its effects on protein synthesisand toxicity in animal models. Two isoforms, modeccin 4B andmodeccin 6B, were isolated, with modeccin 6B exhibiting slightlyless toxicity than modeccin 4B. Notably, modeccin 6B does notagglutinate erythrocytes and is a more effective inhibitor of proteinsynthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, achieving 50% inhibition at aconcentration of 0.31 μg/mL. While the LD50 of modeccin 6B was notexplicitly determined, experiments showed that all rats administered1 µg of the toxin per 100 g body weight died, whereas those receiving0.1 µg survived, indicating its intermediate toxicity compared tomodeccin 4B and its reduced form treated with 2-mercaptoethanol(Barbieri et al., 1980). Another study demonstrated that modeccininhibits protein synthesis both in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates andEhrlich ascites cells, with the inhibitory effect diminished in thepresence of lactose. Interestingly, dissociating modeccin intosubunits reduces its toxicity in vivo, as seen in rats that surviveddoses of 5 µg of dissociated modeccin per 100 g body weight.Furthermore, studies revealed that modeccin is generally more toxicto rats than to mice, causing pathological changes somewhat similar tothose observed in ricin poisoning (Gasperi-campani et al., 1978).Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that stenodactylin, a type2 RIP derived from the A. stenodactyla caudex, exhibits high toxicity inmice, resulting in 100%mortality among those injectedwith 1.21 μg/kgwithin 7 days (Tosi et al., 2009). The high toxicity of volkensin,modeccin, and stenodactylin is due to their ability to inhibit proteinsynthesis, a critical cellular function.Importantly, a case was reported involving four siblings whounintentionally ingested the A. ellenbeckii fruits in the rural Togdheerregion of northern Somaliland. Following consumption, theyexperienced severe illness, including sweating, fever, frequentvomiting, and itching. One sibling progressed to acute kidneyinjury, resulting in a fatal outcome (Rage et al., 2024). In SouthAfrica, the genus has garnered attention primarily due to poisoningincidents associated with A. digitata. In 1922, a poisoning eventresulted in the death of an adult who mistakenly chewed thetubers of A. digitata, believing them to be from a cucurbitaceousplant. Previous reports indicated cases of poisoning among children,including a death attributed to this species in 1928. Investigations atthe Veterinary Research Laboratory in Onderstepoort identified twotoxic principles: hydrocyanic acid and modeccin. Hydrocyanic acidwas found in the fresh leaves of both A. digitata and A. glauca,although the latter’s root was deemed edible. Additionally,observations were made of children consuming the fruits of A.glauca, which they described as pleasant. Confusion arisesregarding the consumption of the sap from the “tuber” of A.midtiflora, likely due to its overlap with the non-toxic and edibleA. glauca. Furthermore, A. venenata and A. palmata are recognized ashaving poisonous tubers (Liebenberg, 1935). These case reports andhistorical accounts of poisoning incidents highlight the potentialdangers associated with the ingestion of certain Adenia species.The presence of hydrocyanic acid (cyanide) in A. digitata and A.glauca can lead to cyanide poisoning, which inhibits cellularrespiration and causes rapid death. Modeccin, another toxiccompound found in A. digitata, inhibits protein synthesis and cancause organ damage. The confusion between toxic and non-toxicspecies underscores the importance of accurate identification andcaution when usingAdenia plants formedicinal or food purposes. Thesymptoms reported in the siblings who ingested A. ellenbeckii fruits,including acute kidney injury, suggest that the toxic compoundspresent in this species can cause severe organ damage.4 ConclusionIn conclusion, the genus Adenia represents a significant area ofstudy at the intersection of traditional medicine and modernpharmacology. While many species within this genus arerecognized for their ethnobotanical uses, particularly in treatingFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org20Mouafon and Katerere 10.3389/fphar.2025.1581659conditions like hypertension and infections, the presence of toxiccompounds—especially in species like A. digitata and A.volkensii—raises important safety concerns. Phytochemical analyseshave identified various bioactive compounds, such as ribosome-inactivating proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and glycosides, whichcontribute to their therapeutic effects, including anticancer,antimicrobial, antioxidant, and analgesic properties. However, thevariability in toxicity among different species and the influence offactors such as geographical location and preparation methodsnecessitate careful evaluation. Future research should prioritizestandardizing methodologies for assessing both the safety andefficacy of Adenia species, alongside comprehensive toxicologicalstudies to elucidate their mechanisms of action. By addressing thesesafety concerns, the therapeutic potential of the genus Adenia can bemore effectively harnessed in modern medical practices.Author contributionsIM: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft.DK: Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Projectadministration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing.FundingThe author(s) declare that no financial support was received forthe research and/or publication of this article.Conflict of interestThe authors declare that the research was conducted in theabsence of any commercial or financial relationships that could beconstrued as a potential conflict of interest.Generative AI statementThe author(s) declare that no Generative AI was used in thecreation of this manuscript.Publisher’s noteAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authorsand do not necessarily represent those of their affiliatedorganizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and thereviewers.
