(Myrtaceae), also known as guava, is a medicinal tree native to tropical Americathat has been introduced and is widely available in many countries. Almost all plant parts of P. guajavahave a long history of being used to treat a variety of ailments, in addition to applications as foods.Guava leaves are used as both medicine and food purposes, and there are numerous scientific reportson their medicinal uses, chemical composition and pharmacological properties. Cancer, blood pressure,diarrhea,  bowel  irregularities,  diabetes,  cough,  cold,  constipation,  dysentery,  scurvy,  weight  loss,improves skins tonicity are some of the diseases treated with guava leaves.  Polyphenols, flavonoids,saponins,  tannins,  terpenoids,  glycosides,  flavones,  cardiac  glycosides,  cardenolides,  phlobatanins,steroids and other classes of bioactive compounds have been identified from the leaves. The primarychemical constituents of guava leaves are phenolic compounds, iso-flavonoids, gallic acid, catechin,quercetin, epicathechin,  rutin,  naringenin,  kaempferol,  caryophyllene oxide,  p-selinene etc.  Severalstudies  have  demonstrated  its  pharmacological  activities  including antioxidant,  antimicrobial,antidiabetic,  antitumor,  anticancer,  antidiarrheal,  healing,  cytotoxic,  hepatoprotective,  anti-inflammatory, antimalarial/ anti-plasmodial, dental plaque, antiglycative and many more. This review isaimed  on  compiling  all  the  literature  reported  on  pharmacological  activities  and  phytochemicalcompositions  of  guava  leaves  as  a  support  to  the scientific  community  for  further  studies  and toprovide scientific data to validate its traditional uses.AbbreviationsABTS: 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid,  ADM:  Adriamycin,  CH3Cl:  Chloroform,  CT:Cholera  toxin,  CUPRAC:  Cupric  ions  (Cu2+)  reducingability, DPPH:  1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl  radical,ELISA:  Enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay,ELISPOT: enzyme-linked immune spot, EtOH: Ethanol,FRAP:  Ferric  ion  reducing  antioxidant  power,  FC:Flavonoid content,  GAE: Garlic acid equivalents, IL-6:Interleukin-6, LDH: Lactate dehydrogenase, LT: Labiletoxin,  MeOH:  Methanol,  MIC:  Minimum  inhibitoryconcentration,  Min:  Minutes,  MTT:  3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide,OGTT:  Oral  glucose  tolerance  test,  ORS:  Oralrehydration  saline,  PGE2:  Prostaglandin  E2,  PMA:Phorbol  myristate  acetate,  PSA:  Prostate  specificantigen, PTP1B: Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, QE:Quercetin  equivalents,  ST:  Stable  toxin,  TBARS:Thiobarbituric  acid  reactive  substances,  TEs:  Troloxequivalents,  TPC:  Total  phenolic  content,  Tr:  Tregulatory.BackgroundPsidium guajava L.  also  known as  guava,  is  a  fruit-bearing tree from the Myrtaceae family that is nativeto tropical America but is now grown throughout thetropics (1). P. guajava belongs to the Kingdom: PlantaeDivision: MagnoliophytaClass: MagnoliopsidaSubclass: Rosidae Order: MyrtalesFamily: MyrtaceaeSubfamily: MyrtoideaeThe  bark  is  reddish  brown,  thin,  smooth  and flaky.The roots are extensive but only superficial. The fruithas  a  strong,  sweet,  musky odor  and can be round,ovoid, or pear-shaped. The leaves are the most used© Bulugahapitiya et al (2021).

They  are  also  used  to  treat  diarrhea,  bacterialinfections, blood cleansing, astringent, lung problems,dysentery,  stomach  pain,  antibiotics,  inflammations,diabetes management, hypertension, sores, boils, cutsand sprains, as well as a boiled preparation for itchyrashes caused by scabies (2-5). Since most  of  the  conventional  medicinal  drugshave been claimed for many unwanted effects, peopleare looking for alternative treatments based on plants.Therefore, strengthening research on pharmacologicalactivities  of  medicinal  herbs  is  highly  important  inorder to validate its medicinal applications. Therefore,the  aim  of  this  review  is  to  compile  the  mostoutstanding evidences based data on phytochemistryand pharmacological activity of P. guajava leaves thathas been published over many years. Phytochemistry of P. guajava leavesPhytochemicals  are  classified  as  either  primary  orsecondary  metabolites,  depending  on  their  role  inplant  metabolism.  Primary  metabolites  includecommon  amino  acids,  sugars,  proteins,  nucleic  acidpurines, pyrimidines, etc. Terpenes, alkaloids, lignans,flavonoids,  plant  steroids,  curcumines,  phenolics,saponins,  flavonoids and glucosides  are examples ofclasses  of  secondary  metabolites  (6).  Guava  leavescontain  a  wide  range  of  phytochemicals  includingflavonoids,  saponins,  alkaloids,  tannins,  terpenoids,polyphenols  and  glycosides  (7).  Guava  leaf  extractsand  essential  oil  have  been discovered to  contain  avariety of individual chemical constituents, which arelisted in Table 1 and Table 2. The Fig. 1 shows some ofthe important phytochemicals found in guava leaves[Phenolic  (gallic  acid  (8)),  Flavonoid  (quercetin  (9)),Ellagitannins  (corilagin  (10)),  Tannin  (pedunculagin(11))  and  Terpenoid  (β-caryophyllene  (12))respectively.Pharmacological activities of P. guajava leavesIt is important to emphasize that herbal medicines arechemically  complex  mixtures  containing  multiplemajor and minor constituents with multiple potentialtargets  and mechanisms in pharmacological  actions.In  this  review,  we  provide  detailed  analysis  ofpharmacological studies carried out for guava leavesby  various  researchers  and  their  findings  withrelevant  literature  citations,  the  same  is brieflysummarized in the Table 3.Antioxidant activity Antioxidant  refers to  a  compound that  can delay  orinhibit  the oxidation of  lipids  or other molecules byinhibiting  the  initiation  or  propagation  of  oxidativechain reactions and which can thus prevent, or repairdamage  done  to  the  cells  of  the  body  by  reactiveoxygen  species  or  reactive  species  generated  frommolecular  oxygen.  They  act  by  one  or  more  of  thefollowing mechanisms: reducing activity, free radical-scavenging,  potential  complexing  of  pro-oxidantmetals and quenching of singlet oxygen. It was reported that antioxidant activity and TPCis high on the order of MeOH  butanol  ethyl acetate˃ ˃ hexane  fractions  of  leaf  extracts  of  guava  (32).˃Further,  the ABTS scavenging  activities  (mM TEs/mgextract):  MeOH:  3.79  ±  0.003,  butanol:  2.90  ±  0.023,ethyl acetate: 2.65 ± 0.065 and FRAP values (EC value,mM/mg extract):  MeOH: 3.65 ± 0.038, butanol: 1.15 ±0.132,  ethyl  acetate:  1.36  ±  0.032  were  reported  forcorresponding  solvent  extracts  of  guava  leaves  (32).Another  research  work  revealed  the  presence  ofguavinoside C,  guavinoside F,  quercetin,  quercetin-3-O-a-L-arabinofuranoside,  quercetin-3-O-a-L  arabino-pyranoside,  quercetin-3-O-b-D  galactopyranoside,guavinoside A and guavinoside B in the leaves and theyall showed potential antioxidant activity towards theDPPH,  ABTS and FRAP assays (33).  It  was evaluatedthe TPC and FC of concentrated and spray dried leafextracts  of  guava  with  significant  free  radicalscavenging  activity  towards  DPPH  and  PMA-stimulation  assays  (34).  According  to  a  study  usinglipid  peroxidation  assays  of  acetaminophen-treatedrats  (with  reduced  glutathione,  catalase,  glutathioneperoxidase  and  superoxide  dismutase  activities)elevated levels of lipid peroxide were reduced usingaqueous  extract  of  leaves  and  the  normalcy  ofglutathione  peroxidase,  glutathione,  catalase  andsuperoxide  dismutase  activities  were  also  restored(35). There are published data on DPPH and FRAP ofguava  leaf  extracts  in  different  solvents  and  theresults  were  summarized  as  follows  (36).  Totalantioxidant capacity (based on FRAP): MeOH fraction:4175.1  µmol  and  EtOH  fraction:  1733.4  µmol.  Freeradical scavenging activity (based on DPPH) - MeOH:85.8%  acetone: 80.8%  EtOH: 77.9%  ethyl acetate:˃ ˃ ˃73.5%   Petrol  ether:  51.9  %   benzene:  60.8%˃ ˃fractions.  They  also  conducted  CUPRAC  andphosphomolybdenum assays and showed comparableantioxidant activities. Antimicrobial activitiesAntimicrobial  activities  of  water  extracts  of  guavaleaves  were  analyzed  using  paper  disc-diffusionmethod (37)  and  found that the extract inhibited thegrowth  of  both  reference  standard  strains  such  asStaphylococcus  aureus ATCC  25923  and  b-streptococcus group  A  1000s  type  28.  The  extractshowed a stronger  inhibitory  effect  on growth of  S.aureus than  b-streptococcus for  antibioticsusceptibility  testing.  There  are  reports  on  theantibacterial  activity  assessment  of  leaf  extracts  ofguava against two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichiacoli and Salmonella enteritidis) and two gram-positivebacteria  (S.  aureus  and Bacillus  cereus)  using  well-diffusion method (38). Antibacterial activities of MeOHand EtOH extracts against gram-positive bacteria werefound to be inhibitory. MeOH extract had antibacterialactivity  against  B.  cereus  and S.  aureus with  meanzones  of  inhibition  of  8.27  mm  and  12.3  mmrespectively  and  EtOH  extract  had  a  mean  zone  ofinhibition  of  6.11  mm  and  11.0  mm.,  while  gram-negative bacteria were immune to all solvent extracts(MeOH, EtOH, hexane and water).  It  was  found thatantibacterial  assays  carried  out  against  E.  coli,  S.964  BULUGAHAPITIYA ET ALPLANT SCIENCE TODAY  965Table 1.

In another antibacterial study conducted  it wasclaimed that  the  aqueous  extract  of  guava leaves  ismore effective than organic extracts at inhibiting thegrowth  of  pathogenic  microorganisms  (E.  coli,  S.pyogenes,  S.  aureus,  P.  aeruginosa  and Proteusmirabilis)  (40). Furthermore,  gram-negative  bacteriawere more resistant to the effects of crude drugs. Thecrude  extracts  are  more  effective  under  acidicconditions  and  at  low  temperatures,  according  todiameters  of  growth inhibition  zones.  Several  otherworks  on antibacterial  activities  based  on agar  discdiffusion  method  revealed  that  MeOH  and  waterextracts of guava leaves inhibited the growth of the allthe  tested  bacteria  (Salmonella  typhimurium,Streptococcus suis, E. coli  and  Pasteurella multocida),but acetone extract exhibited inhibition zones only incolonies of  S. suis and P. multocida. MeOH and waterextracts had the same MIC against P. multocida (0.156mg/ml),  E.  coli (5  mg/ml),  and  S.  typhimurium (5mg/ml),  while  acetone  extract  only  inhibited  thegrowth of S. suis and P. multocida with a MIC of 0.312mg/ml  (41).  Another  two  groups  published  theirantibacterial  assay  data  as  follows.  It  was  reportedthat,  in  agar  diffusion  method  both  aqueous  andMeOH  extracts  of  guava  leaves  showed  strongantibacterial  activity  against  multidrug-resistant  V.cholerae  (42).  MIC of  both extracts:  1250 mg/ml and850  mg/ml,  respectively  against  107  CFU/ml of  V.cholerae. The antibacterial activity of extract is stableat  100  0C  for  around  15-20  min,  indicating  activecomponents are nonprotein. When 10 mg/ml (wt/v) ofcrude aqueous mixture was premixed with ORS in theratio of 1:7 (volume extract/volume ORS),  V. choleraegrowth in rice ORS was fully inhibited. Interestingly,Agar  disc  diffusion  method  was  used  to  analyzeantifungal  property  of  guava  leaf  extracts  againstTrichophyton  tonsurans,  Trichophyton  rubrum,Candida  albicans,  Sporotrix  schenckii,  Candidaparapsilosis,  Cryptococcus  neoformans  andMicrosporum  canis  (43).  Results  revealed  that  thehexane  extract  showed  the  strongest  antifungalactivity,  being  active  against  all  the  dermatophytestested. Relative activity was also found in MeOH andacetone extracts.Antidiabetic activityIt was reported that the in vitro studies on antidiabeticproperties  of  guava leaf  extracts  that  they inhibitedboth  -amylase  and  -glucosidase  enzymes  ɑ ɑ (44).966  BULUGAHAPITIYA ET ALFig. 1. Some of the important phytochemicals found in guava leaves.Further  the  extracts  inhibitory  effect  increases  in  adose-dependent manner on -glucosidase enzyme upɑto 89.4% and -amylase enzyme up to 96.3 % and laterɑpublication  from  the  same  group  revealed  theinhibition of -amylase and -glucosidase enzymes byɑ ɑaqueous and EtOH extracts are as follows. -amylase:ɑ72.1  and 97.5  % and -glucosidase:  74.8  and 91.8  %ɑrespectively (45). With the aid of PTP1B enzyme assay,it  was  reported  that  the  antidiabetic  properties  ofguava  leaf  extracts  where  PTP1B  values  weresignificantly  inhibited  by  extract  and  histologicalexamination  of  liver  of  Leprdb/Leprdb mice  treatedwith  butanol  soluble  fractions  revealed  largereductions  in  the  amount  of  lipid  droplets  ascompared  to  control  mice  (46).  OGTT  model  andalloxan induced diabetic test model showed doses of1.00  g/kg  and  0.50  g/kg  of  extracts  significantly(P<0.05)  decreased  blood  glucose  levels  in  the  oralglucose tolerance test-model as well as 0.75 g/kg dosein alloxan induced diabetic test-model in Wister ratsP<0.001 (47). It is noteworthy to report on anti-hyperglycemicactivities  of  guava  leaf  extracts;  Anti-hyperglycemicpotential against alloxan induced diabetes in rats arehigh in fresh leaf extract than in dry leaf extract (48).Reports  are  on  the  comparison  of  the  anti-hyperglycemic  properties  of  leaf  extract  to  those  ofacarbose,  a  widely  used  diabetic  medication  (49).Extract  had  IC50 values  of  50.5  μg/ml for  -amylaseɑinhibition and 34.6 μg/ml for -glucosidase inhibitionɑin  vitro respectively.  However,  the  IC50 values  ofacarbose,  for  inhibiting  -amylase  and -glucosidaseɑ ɑwere 95.3 μg/ml and 1075.2 μg/ml respectively. Finally,the  anti-hyperglycemic  effect  of  extract  obtainedunder optimal extraction conditions was higher thanthat  of acarbose.  Interestingly,  hypoglycemic activityof leaf extracts of guava has also been reported  (50)where  they  have  observed  statistically  significanthypoglycemic  activity  at  250  mg/kg  oral  dose  onalloxan  induced  hyperglycemia  by  MeOH  extract  ofguava leaves in both acute and subacute tests.Antitumor and anticancer activitiesStudies  are  on the  antitumor  activities  of  guavaextracts  by  cell  proliferation  and  ELISPOT  assayswhere,  addition  of  extract  to  CD4+  splenocytes  ofC57BL/6 mice with blocked induction of Tr cells by IL-10  in vitro, showed the extracts had only a mild/  noeffect on production of both Th1 and Th2 cells (51). Trcells  have not  been  induced  in  splenocytes  of  micewhen extracts were given orally. Extracts moved theTh1/  Th2  equilibrium  to  a  Th1  dominant  state  byinhibiting  Tr  cell  activity.  Using  different  analysistechniques  such  as  cell  viability  and  expression  ofPSA,  LDH  release  assay,  cell  cycle  analysis,  TUNELassay for determination of apoptosis, western blottinganalysis,  gelatinolytic  zymography  and  treatment  inLNCaP prostate cancer xenograft model in nude mice,Another  report  showed that  the aqueous extracts  ofguava leaves  inhibit  LNCaP cell  growth by inducingcytotoxicity  and  apoptosis  (52).  Further  it  inhibitedandrogen  receptor  expression  by  downregulatingphospho-Akt, upregulating phospho-p38 and phospho-ERK1/phospho-ERK2 and arresting the cell cycle at theG1  phase.  Extract  significantly  reduced  serum  PSAlevels and tumor sizes in a xenografted cancer animalmodel.  From  a  study  that  analyzed  anticancerproperties of leaf extracts of guava against HeLa cell-lines,  anti-cancer  response  with  200  μg/ml of  bothMeOH  and  CH3Cl  extracts,  showing  81  % and  91  %inhibition  respectively,  while  regular  drug,doxorubicin,  showed  about  76  %  inhibition.  Incomparison, CH3Cl extract obtained better results thanMeOH extract (53).On  final  account  Zhu  and  co-workers  reportedfollowing data obtained for three potent componentsidentified  from  the  extract:  guavinoside  B,guavinoside E and 3,5-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-1-O-(6’-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-benzophenone  on  cellviability,  colony  formation  assays,  analysis  ofapoptosis by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Cellviability assay: two compounds isolated had inhibitedthe growth of HCT-116 human colon cancer-cell in adose  dependent  manner,  where  one compound wasmore potent than the other. Cytometry analysis: onecompound  showed  stronger  activity  in  inducingcellular  apoptosis  in the cancer cells  than the other.Specifically former compound increased the levels ofp-ERK1/2, p53, p-JNK and cleaved caspases 8 and 9 andlater  compound  increased  the  levels  of  p53  andcleaved caspase 8 (54).Antidiarrheal activityWith the aid of antibacterial assays (microtiter plate-based assay), effect on bacterial colonization: effect onadherence,  effect  on  invasion,  effect  on  bacterialenterotoxins: effect on E. coli heat LT and CT, effect onST,  activity  against  diarrhea  causing  bacteria  wasstudied (55). They have reported; Decoction of leaveshad  antibacterial  activity  against  V.  cholerae  andShigella flexneri. It reduced the development of CT andLT, as well as their binding to GM1. It had no effect ondevelopment of stable toxin. Decoction also inhibitedenteropathogenic  E.  coli adherence  and  invasion  ofHEp-2  cells  by  both  enteropathogenic  E.  coli  and S.flexneri while  quercetin  not  showing  any  effect.Similar antimicrobial activity of extracts was done byanother  group  using  standard  cultures  of  S.  aureus(ATCC  6538)  and  E.  coli (ATCC  15597).  Diarrheainhibition  was  dose-dependent  and  comparable  tostandard  medication,  as  calculated  by  percentagefaucal  production  relative  to  positive  control.  Thegastrointestinal motility  of extract was also reduced,as determined by the distance traveled by a charcoalplug in the small intestine. The anti-diarrhea effect ofextract  was  thus  mediated  by  a  combination  ofantimicrobial  activity  and  a  decrease  ingastrointestinal  motility  (56).  Castor  oil-induceddiarrhea model and gastrointestinal motility test withbarium sulphate milk model were carried out and  itwas  reported  that  EtOH  extract  of  leaves  of  guavashowed antidiarrheal  activity  at  doses  of  750 mg/kgand  500  mg/kg  based  on  the  castor  oil  induceddiarrhea model (P<0.001 and P<0.01 respectively) and750 mg/kg (P<0.01), 500 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg (P<0.05)doses in the barium sulphate milk model (47).Healing and cytotoxic effectsIt  has  been  reported  that  guava  leaf  extracts  havepotential wound healing activity. Reports are on the invivo  clinical and histological  evaluation of traumaticlesions in the oral mucosa of rats treated with selectedPLANT SCIENCE TODAY  967substances  (57).  Following  data  were  reported  forcytotoxic studies of guava leaf extracts (33).  Cytotoxicactivities  of  isolated  compounds  from  guava  leavessuch  as  guavinoside  A,  B,  C,  D,  E  and  F,  quercetin,quercetin-3-O- -L-arabinofuranoside,  quercetin-3-O- -ɑ ɑL-arabinopyranoside  and  quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside  were investigated by MTT assay invitro on SGC-7901, A549 and HeLa cells respectively.Compared with  ADM,  which  gave  the  IC50 values  of1.359 μg/ml 3.118 μg/ml and 2.684 μg/ml against SGC-7901, A549 and HeLa cell lines respectively. The newcompound guavinoside C presented obvious inhibitioneffect on the SGC-7901, A549 and HeLa with the IC50values  of  4.277  μg/ml,  7.288  μg/ml and  3.246  μg/mlrespectively  and  compound  guavinoside  F  showedsimilar  significant  activity.  Quercetin  exhibitedmoderate  inhibition  against  the  SGC-7901  and  HeLawith  the  IC50 values  of  7.878  μg/ml and  8.260  μg/mlrespectively.  The  other  remaining  compounds  werenot  responsible  clearly  for  cytotoxicity  analysis  atsample concentration less than 10 μg/ml (33).Hepatoprotective activitySerum  biochemical  assays  and  histopathologicalexaminations  of  acetaminophen-treated  rats  (withelevated  aspartate  aminotransferase,  alkalinephosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubinand lowered total protein levels) showed at 500 mg/kgdoses  of  aqueous  extract  of  leaves  reduced  theelevated  levels  of  all  these  biochemical  parametersand significantly restored total protein normalcy (35).In  acetaminophen-treated  rats,  lipid  peroxidationincreased  significantly  in  the  liver  tissue,  whilereduced glutathione, catalase,  glutathione Peroxidaseand  superoxide  dismutase  activities  decreased.  Atdoses of 500 mg/kg, aqueous extract reduced elevatedlevels  of  lipid  peroxide  and  restored  glutathioneperoxidase,  glutathione,  catalase  and  superoxidedismutase  to  usual  (35). It  was  showed  in  alcohol-injured  clone  9  cell  viability  and  ALT(Hepatoprotective Assay) assays extract had a stronghepatoprotective  effect  on  alcohol-induced  liver  cellinjury  at  concentrations  of  100  μg/ml or  less  (5  %alcohol for 30 min) (58). The viability of cells has beenshown to be reduced when ethanol concentrations arehigh. However, due to its higher hepatoprotective andlower cytotoxic influence, the protection provided bythe hot water plant extract appears to be greater thanthat  provided  by  the  other  plant  extracts.  Thecytotoxic  activity  of  extract  is  invariably  induced athigher concentrations; hence, cautious administrationis recommended.Anti-inflammatory activityIn anti-inflammatory studies done using egg albumin(IC50: 15.625 μg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (IC50: 50μg/ml), the leaf extracts showed the greatest inhibitionat  concentrations  of  125  μg/ml  and  500  μg/mlrespectively.  In  the  Bovine  serum  albumindenaturation test, the anti-inflammatory activity wasequivalent  to  the  reference drug,  Diclofenac  sodiumand in the egg albumin denaturation test,  it  was 30-fold higher than the reference drug (59). Using nitriteassay,  measurement  of  PGE2 and  IL-6  levels,  ELISA,reverse  transcription-polymerase  chain  reaction,western  blot  analysis,  thermal  hyperalgesiaassessment  and survival  study,  it  was  reported  thatguava  leaf  extract  significantly  inhibitedlipopolysaccharide-induced  nitric  oxide  and  PGE2production in a dose-dependent manner  (60). Extractinhibited  the  expression  and  function  of  bothinducible nitric-oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2in  RAW264.7  macrophages  by  inhibiting  ERK1/2activation.  Furthermore,  in  two  separate  animalmodels, the extract showed strong anti-inflammatoryactivity (60).  There are  studies on anti-inflammatoryactivity  against  acute  inflammation,  subacuteinflammation  and  chronic  inflammation  using  fourgroups of mice [control; Group-A (3 %  gum acacia in10 ml/kg body weight) there were major inhibitions ofpaw edema in Group-B (PGE 250 mg/kg body weight),Group-C  (PGE  500  mg/kg  body  weight)  and  thestandard; Group-D (Aspirin 100 mg/kg body weight)] inthe  acute  inflammation  (P<0.05)  (61).  In  contrast  toGroup-A,  there  were  major  inhibitions  of  exudateformation  in  Group-B,  Group-C  and  Group-D duringsubacute  inflammation.  In the chronic inflammationstudy,  the  Groups-B,  Group-C  and  Group-D  showedsubstantial  inhibition of paw edema and weight lossas compared to the Group-A. In contrast to Group-A,downregulation of the arthritis index was also notablein Group-B, Group-C and Group-D. Another researchgroup  reported  leaves  extract  decreased  inhibitoryactivity by 40.81 %, 55.45 % and 43.61 % respectivelyat  doses  of  125,  250  and  500  mg/kg body weight  incarrageenan  induced  rat  paw  edema.  According  tothis  report,  leaf  extract  has  anti-inflammatoryproperties by reducing edema (62). Antimalarial property/ Anti-plasmodial activityMany  studies  have  claimed  Antimalarial  property/Anti-plasmodial activity of guava leaf extracts where,EtOH extract has anti-plasmodium activity in vitro andin  vivo.  Antimalarial  activity  of  EtOH  extract:  ED50(mg/kg body weight): 274.69 ± 7.65, IC50 (μg/ml): 0.6250± 0.2100 (63).  In another  antimalarial  assay  in  vitroIC50 (μg/ml)  value  of  dried  guava  leaf  extract  was  8μg/ml for Plasmodium berghei while the (IC50, μg/ml) offresh guava leaf extract for P. berghei 8.2 μg/ml. driedguava leaf extract showed higher antimalarial activitythan  fresh  leaf  extract  (64).  Polyherbal  formulationwith several different plant extracts along with guavaleaf  extract  “Nefang”  has  shown  excellent  in  vivoantimalarial activity against  Plasmodium berghei andPlasmodium chabaudi parasites in acute (single dose)oral toxicity,  suppressive activity (Peter’s 4-day test),prophylactic activity and curative activity (Rane’s test)testing (65).Dental PlaqueUnder  stressed  growth  environments,  the  aqueousextract exhibited bacteriostatic effects on early dentalplaque  bacteria  such  as  S.  mitis,  S.  sanguinis andActinomyces sp. The bacteria appeared to be unable toperform  normal  biological  functions  and  ultimatelyceased  to  propagate.  Exologically,  such  event  willregulate  the  formation  of  dental  plaque  (66).  Thetreatment  of  early  plaque  settlers  with  a  1  mg/mlextract decreased the cell surface hydrophobicity of S.mitis, Actinomyces sp.  and S.  sanguinis by 49.9%, 40.6% and 54.1 % respectively. It was also discovered thatthe plant extract's anti-adhesive effect on blindness of968  BULUGAHAPITIYA ET ALthe  early  plaque  settlers  to  the  hexadecane  isconfounding (67).Antiglycation effectA group working on kinetic  studies  on antiglycationeffects in physio mimic systems recorded that aqueousextract (0.01–0.625 mg/ml) of guava leaves was havingspecial  inhibitory  characteristic  on  LDL  glycationeffect  due  to  its  high  polyphenolic  content  (165.6110.39 mg GAE/g) by determination of TBARS and TPC(68).  To  summarize,  aqueous  extract  is  an  excellentanti-LDL  glycate  agent  with  possible  therapeuticapplications  in  the  prevention  of  a  range  ofcardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases linkedto glycations. It was also reported that leaf extract hasshown potential  antiglycative activity in a bio-modelof  low-density  lipoproteins,  which  can be due  to  itshigher polyphenolic content of leaves (69). The dose-dependent  inhibition  models  were  validated  usingcomputer  simulation.  Extract  contains  a  highconcentration  of  polyphenolic  compounds  Catechin,gallic  acid,  epicatechin,  quercetin,  rutin,  kaempferoland  naringenin  are  the  seven  main  compoundspresent  in  guava  leaf  extract.,  whose  antiglycativebioactivity  is  consistent  with  the  inhibition  models(kinetic studies) using TBARS studies (69). Table  3  summarizes  individual  pharmacologicalactivities,  the  nature  of  the  extracts  and  thecorresponding  references  discussed  above.  Thisreview will  be  the  first  and  comprehensive scientificrepository of guava leaves as this gives a broad analysisof  phytochemistry  and  pharmacological  activity  ofguava leaf including chemical compositions of differentguava  leaf  extracts  and  essential  oil,  andpharmacological activities with sufficient proven data.ConclusionThis  review  provides literature  data  on  in-depthstudies  of Guava (P. guajava)  leaves for biochemicalcomposition  and  pharmacological  activities.  Ingeneral, it contains a variety of chemical constituentssuch as alkaloids, polyphenolic compounds, saponins,tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, carbohydrates, lipids,fats  and oils,  as  well  as  various  types  of  glycosides,amino  acids,  etc.  Furthermore,  structure  elucidationof biochemicals present in guava leaves revealed thatthe plant contains a plethora of chemical compoundssuch as catechin, quercetin, gallic acids, epicathechin,rutin, naringenin, kaempferol, caryophyllene oxide, p-selinene and others. Because of the presence of such adiverse range of chemicals, this priceless plant has awide range of pharmacological activities that could bebeneficial  in  treating  a  variety  of  health  conditions.This review is merely an attempt to compile some ofthem,  and  as  stated  under  its  pharmacologicalproperties, the leaf extracts have the ability to act asan antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antitumor,anticancer,  antidiarrheal,  healing,  cytotoxic,hepatoprotective,  anti-inflammatory,  antimalarial/anti-plasmodial,  dental  plaque,  antiglycative  and  soon.  This  would  help  researchers  to  quickly  selectliterature  on a specific  topic of  interest.  To sum up,guava  leaves  are  multifunctional  medicinal  greensources  with  a  diverse  array  of  potent  secondarymetabolites.AcknowledgementsAuthors  greatly  acknowledge  AHEAD/RUH/DOR-05grant for the financial support.Authors’ contributionsAll  the  authors  have  contributed  for  collectingresearch  literature  and  preparation  of  themanuscript.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict  of  interest:  The  authors  declare  that  theyhave no conflicts of interest regarding the publicationof this paper.Ethical issues: None.References1.
