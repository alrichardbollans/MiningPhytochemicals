ABSTRACT: The application of chemical pesticides for the control of fungal diseases results in 
impacts on the environment and human health. The use of vegetal extracts with antifungal properties for the 
proper management of crops becomes a viable alternative, mainly for organic and family farming. The 
objective of this study was to carry out the phytochemical evaluation of Datura inoxia, evaluating its antifungal 
potential against the mycelial growth of Fusarium solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The extracts, aqueous 
and ethanolic, obtained from the leaves of the plant collected in areas of the municipality of Campo Grande, 
Mato Grosso do Sul, were submitted to phytochemical prospecting and quantification of flavonoids and total 
phenols. It was evaluated its antifungal activity at concentrations of 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2400 μg 100 
mL-1. Each concentration was separately incorporated into BDA agar, poured into Petri dishes, and inoculated 
with the mycelial disc of the fungus. The diameter of the colonies were measured daily. Two solutions were 
prepared as control, one containing the solvent added to PDA medium (ethanol solution), and another with only 
PDA medium (without D. inoxia extract, control). In both extracts were found the same diversity of secondary 
metabolites (nine classes). The ethanolic extract, a solvent of lower polarity than water, was more efficient in 
the extraction of these constituents. Alkaloids and phenolic compounds were the most frequent compounds 
(100%). In relation to antifungal activity, the ethanolic extract provided 100% inhibition of mycelial growth of 
Sclerotinia sclerotitorum in all concentrations, relative to the control. On the other hand, the growth of 
Fusarium solani was only negatively affected at the highest concentrations of 800 and 1200 μmL-1 100 mL-1. 
The antifungal potential of Datura inoxia was probably related to the abundance of alkaloids and phenolic 
compounds in its chemical constitution that negatively effects the development of the vegetative mycelium.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The species Datura inoxia Mill. 
(Solanaceae), commonly called angel’s trumpet, 
devil’s trumpet, and buenas tardes, among other 
popular names, has a herbaceous or sub-shrub way 
of life, reaching up to 2 m (height) and is considered 
an annual plant when in dry environments or a 
perennial when environmental conditions are 
favourable (BURKILL, 2000; BONDE, 2001). It is 
native to Central America but is considered to be a 
naturalised plant in Brazil, and is found in 
anthropogenic areas in Caatinga of Bahia and of 
Pernambuco states (FLORA DO BRASIL, 2020). 
Due to its cultivation, the species has also been 
established in natural areas as an invasive species. 
Its ornamental features and beautiful flowers with a 
sweet odour which open at night have led it to be 
cultivated in gardens, and for this reason, it is 
widespread to all continents (BURKILL, 2000; 
BONDE, 2001).  
Most people who grow this plant do not 
know that it is considered to be extremely toxic and 
has caused many accidents due to ingestion of their 
leaves. The plant is used in shamanistic rituals as an 
instrument to achieve illumination and also to obtain 
a hallucinogenic effect by drug users. There are 
phytotherapeutic uses, with the plant used to treat 
impotence, asthma, and diarrhoea, among other 
uses. However, it produces unpleasant results, such 
as disorientation, amnesia, and blurred vision, 
among other effects, and an overdose can result in 
death (SCHULTES; HOFMANN, 1992; BURKILL, 
2000; BONDE, 2001).   
The species has a number of active 
phytochemicals, including atropine, hyoscyamine, 
hyoscine, scopolamine, and meteloidine (GUPTA; 
BAGCHI; RAY, 1991), with a high concentration of 
alkaloids in the tissues, which varies according to

the environment (BURKILL, 2000). Due to its 
diversity of metabolites, it is a species that presents 
a potential to be tested for use in different situations, 
such as in the control of phytopathogenic fungi that 
affect different crops and is responsible for 
economic losses in agricultural production. 
Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. and 
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, are 
phytopathogens found in the soil and have been 
considered a problem because they produce 
resistance structures and can survive for several 
years (BUENO; AMBRÓSIO; SOUZA, 2007). 
According to Celoto et al. (2008), different kinds of 
chemical products are used for controlling it; 
however, their incorrect application leads to several 
impacts on the environment and human health, and 
may also lead to a selection of resistant pathogens to 
agrotoxics. Because of that, the use of natural 
products to control plant diseases is becoming a 
promising alternative to reduce using agrotoxics 
(ZACARONI et al., 2009) because certain vegetal 
extracts have antifungal potential and may be used 
as a model to synthesise new fungicides or be 
directly applied by the producer (CELOTO et al., 
2008; OLIVEIRA et al. 2017). Silva et al. (2009) 
also state that the use of vegetal extracts to control 
or inhibit phytopathogens represents a viable 
alternative for organic and family farmers common 
in certain regions. 
In the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, farmer 
families have contributed to developing local 
agribusiness, such as providing healthy food for 
families (SANGALLI; SCHLINDWEIN, 2013) 
through the use of more environmentally balanced 
practices, contributing to culture diversification, and 
reducing the use of chemical products (PADUA; 
SCHLINDWEIN; GOMES, 2013). The study of 
plants with potential use (insecticide, bactericide 
and fungicide) it is important for use in sustainable 
activities related to family farming. Thus, the aim of 
this study was to perform phytochemical and 
antioxidant analysis of the Datura inoxia, and assess 
its antifungal potential on the mycelial growth of 
Fusarium solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
Leaves of Datura inoxia were collected in 
August 2016 from 31 plants found in areas in the 
countryside of Campo Grande (Latitude -20° 26' 
34'', Longitude -54° 38' 47''. Altitude 532 meters), in 
the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Botanic 
material at the same vegetative stage was collected 
during three days, in the morning period, and stored 
in paper bags and transported to the Plant 
Morphology Laboratory at the University in Campo 
Grande City, and the specimen’s samples deposited 
in the Herbarium of the Institution. 
 
Phytochemical analysis 
The collected plant material, after excluding 
old or damaged leaves, was dried in a circulating air 
oven at 40°C (MARCONI®, MA35), and finely 
ground in a Wiley mill (Model MA048, 
MARCONI®). Secondary metabolites were 
extracted from the powder (500 g) using distilled 
water in an ultrasonic bath (Ultrasonic Cleaner®) 
for 60 minutes, followed by extraction by steady 
static maceration for seven days. The resulting 
solution was filtered, and the solvent was 
distilled with the rotary evaporator (45 to 50°C). 
The final drying in a desiccator under reduced 
pressure resulted in 17 g of aqueous extract 
(ExtH2O). The same procedure was used to obtain 
32 g of the ethanolic extract (ExtEtOH), but the 
extraction occurred for ten days. Both extracts were 
submitted to chemical and fungicide analysis.  
Phytochemical prospection with ExtH2O 
and ExtEtOH were done through characterisation 
reactions to determine the class of secondary 
metabolites (Table 1), all analyses were performed 
in triplicate, following and adapting the 
methodology by Matos (2009) and Simões et al. 
(2017). 
For the results of the assays, the alterations 
in the colour or precipitation were observed when 
compared with the control, following the method of 
Fontoura et al. (2015). Strongly positive (+++= 
100%), moderately positive (++= 50%), weakly 
positive (+= 25%), and partially positive (±= 10%). 
Whether only haze or partially changed colour also 
the absence of colour or precipitation was 
considered as negative (-). The intensity of colour or 
precipitation indicated the increased concentration 
of each class of secondary metabolite. Extracts were 
submitted to Bial, Seliwanoff, Barfoed, and Iodine 
tests for sugar classification (REMIÃO; 
SIQUEIRA; AZEVEDO, 2003). To confirm the 
reducing sugars, an analysis of soluble solids was 
determined by means of a digital refractometer 
(Model 45 RTD- refractometer), and the results 
were expressed in °Brix, corrected for 20 ºC. 
In order to confirm the major constituents, 
100 µm mL-1 of the extracts were analysed by a 
scanning spectrophotometer (Model 800, 
FEMTO®). Samples absorption aspects were 
measured from the 200 to 750 nm region using 
quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany) and 
repeated in triplicate (SILVERSTEIN; WEBSTER; 
KIEMLE, 2007).

Total phenol and flavonoids classification  
The ExtH2O and ExtEtOH (100 mg each) 
were used to quantify the total phenol (TP) by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method using gallic acid (10 to 350 
mg mL-1) as a standard, and a (y = 0.781 x – 0.0031; 
R² = 0.9959) calibration curve was used (SOUSA et 
al., 2007). Flavonoid quantification was performed 
based on aluminum chloride methodology with a 
standard quercetin (y= 0.132 x + 0.0353 R² = 
0.9949) (PEIXOTO SOBRINHO et al., 2008). 
The experimental design of both 
quantifications has three replicates for each 
concentration, and the calculation of averages was 
followed by the standard deviation. 
 
Antifungal activity 
The fungi used in this study were Fusarium 
solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, assigned by the 
Microbiology and Phytopathology Laboratory, 
Campo Grande. A stock solution was prepared 
containing 0.2 g of ExtH2O and ExtEtOH from the 
Datura inoxia leaves in 100 mL (water or ethanol), 
and all solutions were prepared from this stock. 
From this solution with 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 
mL were separated into fondant PDA (Potato-
Dextrose-Agar) culture medium until reaching a 
volume of 100 mL, where concentrations of 800, 
1200, 1600, 2000, and 2400 µg 100 mL-1 were 
obtained. Two solutions were prepared as control, 
one containing the solvent added to PDA medium 
(2400 µg 100 mL-1) and named ethanol solution, 
and another with only PDA medium (without D. 
inoxia extract, control). 
Four Petri dishes of each concentration were 
prepared with 90 mm in a volume corresponding to 
10 mL per plate. After solidification, a mycelium 
disc, with a 5 mm diameter was placed in the centre 
of each plate. Later, the plates were covered and 
sealed with plastic film and kept in a growth 
chamber at 25ºC with a 12-hour photoperiod. 
The mycelial growth evaluation was 
performed through daily measurements of the 
colonies’ diameter, obtained by the average of two 
opposed measurements and continued until the 
control group reached the edge of the Petri plate. 
Based on the obtained data, the growth 
inhibition percentage (GIP) was calculated by the 
formula:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Chemical constituents detected in the leaf 
extracts (ExtH2O and ExtEtOH) indicated the same 
diversity of secondary metabolites (nine classes). 
However, the ethanolic extract, a solvent of less 
polarity than water, was more efficient in extracting 
these constituents, with an emphasis on alkaloids 
and phenolic compounds with higher frequency 
(100%), followed by triterpenes, tannins, steroids, 
coumarins and flavonoids at 50% frequency (Figure 
1).  
 
 
Figure 1. Frequency (%) of secondary metabolites found in the aqueous extract (ExtH2O) and ethanolic extract 
(ExtEtOH) of Datura inoxia leaves. 
 
Aqueous extract presented a lower 
frequency of secondary metabolites, being 50% for 
alkaloids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and 
saponins; only the saponins showed a higher 
frequency in relation to ExtEtOH (Figure 1). The 
use of ethanol as an effective solvent for the 
extraction of phytochemicals has also been reported 
by Pereira et al. (2018), working with leaves of 
Anacardium humille A.St.-Hil, and reporting the 
presence of eight classes of metabolites. 
Vernay et al. (2008) also pointed out 
alkaloids as major constituents in the leaves of D. 
inoxia, a specimen grown in France. Ayuba, Ojobe 
and Ayuba (2011) studied the leaves of specimens 
in India and found in addition to the alkaloids, the 
presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, 
saponins, cardiotonic heterosides and essential oils. 
The alkaloids and steroids were mentioned by 
Eftekhar, Yousefzadi and Tafakori (2005) for 
methanol extracts from the aerial parts of the 
investigated plant collected in Iran. Al-Sarai, Abbas 
and Al-Rekabi (2011), by analysing the ethanolic 
extract of leaves also collected in Iran, found a 
greater diversity of phytoconstituents (alkaloids, 
phenols, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, saponins, 
glycosides, and resins), which were attributed to in 
vitro antibacterial activity. Joshi and Kaur (2013), 
when investigating D. inoxia leaves collected 
randomly and aseptically from different areas of 
India found a greater diversity of secondary 
metabolites (alkaloids, phenolic compounds, 
flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids and steroids) in the 
aqueous extract in relation to the methanolic and 
ethanolic extracts (alkaloids, phenolic and flavonoid 
compounds and steroids). Recently, Bagewadi et al. 
(2019) determined that the phytochemical profiling 
of the methanolic leaf extract of D. inoxia collected 
in India revealed the occurrence of important 
phytochemicals, with a predominance of alkaloids 
in relation to the phenols, carbohydrates, flavonoids, 
saponins, and terpenoids. 
Based on this information and our findings, 
it is possible to infer that the diversity of secondary 
metabolites and their frequency are related to the 
plants’ origin and the extraction methods, because 
depending on these two factors significant 
differences in metabolites class may occur. 
According to Gobbo Neto and Lopes (2007) and 
Oliveira et al. (2017), there are several factors that 
may alter the presence of secondary metabolites, 
such as geographical location of the collection site, 
plant developmental stage, and the period of the

year, among other factors, explaining the results 
found by this research. 
In relation to the chemical profile by 
spectroscopy, alkaloid characteristic bands (λ = 230 
nm, Band A and λ = 260-270, Band B) were 
observed, which confirms the tests performed with 
the use of specimen reagents and standards for 
alkaloids. In addition, it was reported for the species 
of the genus Datura the alkaloids of the tropane 
type, and for this chemical group, two electronic 
transitions with maximum absorption in the region 
of 230 and 275 nm were reported. The first band, 
corresponding to the electronic transition π → π* of 
the benzoyl group and the second, the keto group 
(Figure 2). 
Unlike the other secondary metabolites, 
alkaloids constitute a broad group of metabolites 
with great structural diversity, representing about 
20% of the natural substances described and 
common in Solanaceae. Species of the Datura genus 
are known to be rich in tropane alkaloids, such as 
atropine ((8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-
yl)3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate), hyoscyamine 
(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl)3-hydroxy-2-
phenylpropanoate and scopolamine. This biological 
activity was related to the chemical structure of this 
group of substances (KLEIN-JÚNIOR; 
HENRIQUES, 2017; HERNANDES; KATO; 
BACCHI, 2017). According to Wittstock and 
Gershenzon (2001), the species produce alkaloids as 
a defence mechanism in response to herbivory and 
pathogen attacks. 
Tropanes, like other alkaloids, possess a free 
pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, which 
confers basicity and reactivity to these compounds. 
In general, alkaloids with pairs of free electrons 
have basic character (alkaline), soluble in solvents 
with polarity less than water and in polar solvents 
(KLEIN-JÚNIOR; HENRIQUES, 2017), which 
explains the higher frequency evidenced in the 
ExtEtOH (Figure 1).  
It is possible to observe the bands C and D 
(Figure 2), common for the phenolic compounds (λ= 
280-300 nm) and the E and F bands, related to 
flavonoids (entre λ= 320-390 nm) (Figure 2). 
According to Zuanazzi, Montanha and Zucolotto 
(2017), for the flavonoids, it is common to observe 
two maximum bands of visible UV absorption, one 
being between 240-285 nm corresponding to ring A 
of the benzoyl system aromatic compounds with 
auxochromic substitution (280 nm) as the hydroxyl 
group, and another between 300-400 nm assigned to 
ring B of the cinnamoyl system. Similar results were 
found by Fatima et al. (2015) when investigating 
specimens of Pakistan, who detected on the leaves 
the flavonoids: catechin (279 nm), apigenin (325), 
and quercetin (368), which corroborates our 
findings. Also in this study, the antioxidant activity, 
visible protein kinase inhibitory activity against 
Streptomyces 85E strain with bald phenotype of 22 
mm, as well as the remarkable antimicrobial 
potential of leaf extract against Micrococcus luteus 
were related to flavonoids. 
The soluble solid and the total phenolic and 
flavonoid content, obtained from the leaf ExtH2O 
and ExtEtOH of Datura inoxia (Table 1), has values 
of soluble solids higher than ExtEtOH, confirming 
the existence of substances groups dissolved in 
water, such as reducing sugars, phenolic acids, and 
saponins (Figure 1). 
Regarding the phenolic compounds and 
derivates, a significant difference only occurred in 
total flavonoids, with their concentration being 
higher for the ExtEtOH. These results were higher 
than phenolic compounds (70.3 ± 1.1 mg GAE/g) 
and total flavonoids (34.2 ± 1.3 mg RE/g) found by 
Bhardwaj, Kumar and Ojha (2016) for the 
methanolic extract obtained from the leaves of 
specimens collected in Haryana, India. However, 
our results were lower than those obtained by 
Nandakumar et al. (2017) for phenolic compounds 
(3.62 ± 0.0147 mg/g) and flavonoids (4.12 ± 0.0167 
mg/g) found in Datura inoxia leaves collected in 
different regions of India (Orathanadu Village, 
Thanjavur District and Tamilnadu) 
Concerning to the antifungal action, the 
ethanolic extract, which has a higher intensity of 
secondary phytochemicals (Figure 1) and total 
flavonoids (Table 2), provided 100% inhibition of 
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum mycelial growth in all 
concentrations compared to the control (Figure 3). 
On the other hand, Fusarium solani growth was 
negatively affected only at the highest 
concentrations (2000 and 2400 μmL-1 100 mL-1). 
The aqueous extract did not influence 
Fusarium solani growth. Nevertheless, for 
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, inhibition values varied 
from 29 to 94%, with the highest action 
concentrations being 1600 and 2000 μg 100mL-1, 
reaching 94% inhibition (Figure 4).

The results showed that Sclerotinia 
sclerotiorum is more sensitive to the secondary 
metabolites of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts, 
even with lower extraction capacity solvents. It 
should be noted that flavonoids, with 50% intensity 
in both extracts, are an important metabolite in fungi 
control since these compounds act directly on 
cytoplasmic granulation, cellular contents 
disorganization, plasma membrane rupturing, and 
inhibition of enzymes produced by fungi in the 
moment of penetration into the host (KNAAK; 
FIUZA, 2010). Oliveira et al. (2017), evaluating 
different extracts and fractions of Pouteria 
ramiflora (Mart.) Radlk. on Lasiodiplodia 
theobromae growth, also correlated the lower rate of 
mycelial development with the presence of 
flavonoids in higher intensity. 
The in vitro assays are performed to 
evaluate the inhibitory capacity of plant extracts on 
phytopathogenic fungi, and are essential to indicate 
which plant species may present potential use. In 
this situation, Datura inoxia stood out because of its 
diversity of metabolites.  
The ExtEtOH completely inhibited mycelial 
growth of S. sclerotiorum, and it can be inferred that 
this action was due to the high concentration of

http://dx.doi.org/10.14393/BJ-v36n3a2020-47881 
phenolic compounds and alkaloids. These 
substances are directly related to the antifungal 
action and are able to act in a fungicide and/or 
fungistatic way. According to Gomes, Pena and 
Almeida (2016), these compounds, when present in 
plants extracts, present a potential inhibitor of 
mycelial growth, as well as acting on the germ tube 
emission of the phytopathogenic fungi, information 
that confirms the control efficiency observed in the 
present work. In addition, other compounds, such as 
triterpenes, extracted mainly in the ethanolic extract, 
also present direct action on fungal cells and, 
according to Stangarlin et al. (2011), inhibit spore 
germination and mycelial growth. 
These substances are recognised by their 
fungicidal action since they can easily pass through 
fungus membrane cell, causing cellular contents 
extravasation (BARILE et al., 2007), which 
prevents mycelial growth and potential infection of 
phytopathogens in the host tissue (SCHWAN-
ESTRADA; STANGARLIN; PASCHOLATI, 
2008). This action mode would contribute to the use 
of this extract in foliar spraying, to control 
pathogens that attack the aerial part of cultivated 
plants. 
Taking into account the results obtained in 
vitro that demonstrated the potential use of the 
Datura inoxia species, new studies should be carried 
out under greenhouse conditions, with foliar spray 
or soil application, to observe the control capacity, 
as well as the reproducibility of the results observed 
under controlled conditions, since it was evident that 
the diversity of the constituents present in D. inoxia 
leaves, with a predominance of alkaloids and 
flavonoids, acted synergistically in the control of F. 
solani and S. sclerotiorum. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Datura inoxia extract provided mycelial 
growth inhibition of the fungi studied, with the 
ethanolic extract being more effective in the control 
of F. solani and S. sclerotiorum. The aqueous 
extract was efficient in reducing S. sclerotiorum 
growth. 
Datura inoxia antifungal potential was 
probably related to the plant’s chemical constitution, 
which has an abundance of alkaloids and phenolic 
compounds, related to the plant’s defence system 
against invasive organisms, that negatively affected 
the development of the vegetative mycelium.

RESUMO: A aplicação de defensivos químicos para o controle de doenças fúngicas tem por 
consequência impactos sobre o ambiente e a saúde humana. Desta forma, a utilização de extratos vegetais com 
propriedades antifúngicas associado ao manejo adequado de culturas, torna-se uma proposta viável de controle 
alternativo, principalmente na agricultura orgânica e familiar. Neste sentido, objetivou-se realizar a avaliação 
fitoquímica das folhas de Datura inoxia, avaliando seu potencial antifúngico frente ao crescimento micelial de 
Fusarium solani e Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Os extratos, aquoso e etanólico, obtidos das folhas da planta 
coletadas em áreas do município de Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, foram submetidos à prospecção 
fitoquímica e quantificação flavonoides e fenóis totais, avaliando-se sua atividade antifúngica em 
concentrações de 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 e 2400 µg 100 mL-1. Cada concentração foi incorporada, 
separadamente, em ágar BDA, vertida em placas de petri, seguida da colocação do disco de micélio do fungo, 
com diâmetro das colônias sendo medido diariamente. Utilizou-se como controle negativo, ágar sem extrato e 
ágar com solução etanólica. Nos dois extratos ocorreu a mesma diversidade de metabólitos secundários (nove 
classes); porém o extrato etanólico, um solvente de menor polaridade que a água, foi mais eficiente na extração 
destes constituintes, com destaque aos alcaloides e compostos fenólicos com maior frequência (100%). Em 
relação a atividade antifúngica, o extrato etanólico proporcionou inibição de 100% do crescimento micelial de 
Sclerotinia sclerotitorum, em todas as concentrações, em relação a testemunha. Por outro lado, o crescimento 
de Fusarium solani foi afetado negativamente apenas nas maiores concentrações, 800 e 1200 µmL-1 100 mL-1.
