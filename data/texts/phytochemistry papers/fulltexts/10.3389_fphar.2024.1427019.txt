(PM), also known as He Shou Wu (HSW), is aperennial vine of the Polygonaceae family. First documented in “Kai Bao Ben Cao,”HSW has been a staple in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, treating a range ofailments including sores, age-related conditions, and anemia. Over 100 chemicalconstituents have been identified in PM, with variations in toxicity attributed todifferences in these components.

Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) employs processing and compatibility techniques to reducetoxicity and enhance therapeutic effects, which are practical for dailyuse and deserve further research. This review aims to elucidate thetraditional uses, chemical composition, toxicology, anddetoxification methods of PM, providing a foundation for futureresearch and therapeutic development.2 Traditional application of PM“He Shou Wu” has been an official entry in the ChinesePharmacopoeia since the Tang dynasty, over 1200 years ago. Itwas first recorded in “Kai Bao Ben Cao,” with pharmacologicaleffects of anti-sores and anti-aging, treating anaemia andpostpartum diseases. “Compendium of Materia Medica” statedthat PM can treat the pain in the loins and knee, “Ben Cao XinBian,” “Ben Cao Qiu Zhen” recorded that PM is used to treatheadache, hemorrhoids, cutaneous pruritus, and immune relateddisease. “Zhong Hua Yao Dian” also stated that PM can be used totreat constipation and hyperlipidemia (Figure 1).PM is often used in conjunction with other herbs informulations that address age-related conditions. Processed PM isusually used in age-related diseases. “Shi Bu Zhai Yi Shu”mentioneda formula named “Shou Wu Yan Shou Pill,” which can be used totreat hypertension and delaying the process of aging. There isanother formula named “Qi Bao Mei Ran Pill,” which was statedin “Ji Shan Tang Fang,” it is used to treat hair losing. While raw PMis mainly used for treatment of postpartum fever, such as the formulaof “He Ren Decoction” recorded in “Jing Yue Quan Shu”.In summary, PM is extensively used to nourish the liver andkidneys, nourish blood, and dispel wind, exhibiting a wide range ofpharmacological effects that differ between its raw and processedforms. Processed PM is predominantly used for liver and kidney yindeficiency, including conditions like premature graying, weakness ofthe waist and knees, muscle and bone pain, limb numbness, tinnitus,neurasthenia, hyperlipidemia, and spermatozoa issues. It is also usedto nourish blood, commonly treating anemia and dizziness. Raw PMis mostly used in dispel wind. Raw PM is mostly used in treatment oflong-term malaria, long-term dysentery, chronic hepatitis, scrofulaand hemorrhoids (Supplementary Table S1).Clinical trials have validated these pharmacological effects.For instance, one study found that the PM group showed themost significant increase in black hair, with higher levels of totalmelanin, α-MSH, MC1R, and TYR—key targets in PM’s use forhair graying. Chemical constituents other than TSG maycontribute to the hair color regulation activity of PMR (Hanet al., 2015). Another trial showed that the effect of PM extract onAD is superior to western medicine. The total effective rate of93.33% in the PM extract treatment group was better than 73.33%in the Chinese herb control group and 68.97% in the westernmedicine control group (p < 0.01) (Chen et al., 2010).Additionally, Yadong Fan et al., 2021 investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of Tongmai Yangxin pill, a formulaincluding PM, in treatment of coronary heart disease, andresults showed that TMYX treatment showed reduced levels ofapolipoprotein B, endothelin 1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) andhomocysteine in CHD patients, suggesting the formula’seffectiveness in attenuating macrophage foam cell formationand its anti-inflammatory activity through modulation of theESR1 and NF-κB signaling pathways.FIGURE 1Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.: the plant, the medical section, the slices before and after processing.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.14270193 The chemical components of PMThe chemical components of PM varies between its water andalcohol extracts. The chief toxic compositions in water extract arestilbenes, while in alcohol extract are quinones. More than103 components are isolated and characterized in PM, includingflavonoids, phospholipids, quinones, stilbenes, etc. Stilbenes andquinones are the main characteristic components in PM, with casesof hepatotoxicity reported.3.1 The effective ingredients are generallyextracted from raw/processed PM usingwater and alcoholWhile some studies suggest that the water extract is less toxic thanthe alcohol extract, this remains a topic of debate. Water extract of PMtreated groups showed significant inhibitions in CYP2E1 enzymaticactivities and mRNA expressions (Li et al., 2015). However, anotherstudy compared the toxicity of water extract and alcohol extract of PM,and the result indicated that alcohol extract had much strongerhepatotoxicity than water extract, the content of emodin-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, emodin andphyscion was significantly higher in alcohol extract than in waterextract, while the human hepatocytes extraction showed that2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, emodin-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, emodinand physcion had interaction with human hepatocytes (Lv et al.,2015). Yang Xuehuan et al. showed a different result, they provedthat the toxicity of water extract was greater than that of alcohol extract.Based on metabolomics technology, they found that the liver toxicity ofalcohol extract and water extract of PM was mainly caused by onecarbon unit metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism andglycerophospholipid metabolism (Wang et al., 2021). Main toxiccomponents and toxic mechanisms of water extract (Table 1) andalcohol extract (Table 2) are as follows.Additional studies have explored other extracts of PM, scholarsshowed that ethyl acetate (EA) extract had close association with theidiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of PM. Co-treatment with non-toxicdose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and EA extract could result inevident liver injury, indicated by the significant elevation of plasmaalanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) activities, as well as obvious liver histologic damage (Liet al., 2016). Another study assessed in zebrafish embryos showedthat the toxicity of 70% EtOH extract is considerably higher thanthat of other extracts (Yang et al., 2018).In conclusion, both raw and processed PM pose risks to liverhealth, though the extent of toxicity varies among the differentextracts. As a result, although the hepatotoxicity of processedproduct is reduced, caution should be taken in its clinical use.3.2 The chemical components of PM arereported including flavonoids,phospholipids, quinones and stilbenesPM is known for its diverse phytochemical composition, includingflavonoids, phospholipids, quinones, and stilbenes. Notably, stilbenesand quinones stand out as key components due to theirpharmacological properties and associated hepatotoxic risks, withcompounds such as 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and emodin dianthrones being particularly significant.TABLE 1 Toxic components and toxic mechanisms of water extract of PM.Water extracttoxic components Toxic mechanismsstilbene glycoside, emodin 8-O-β-D glucoside, emodin and emodinmethyl etherInhibit the mRNA expression of various CYP450 enzymes in human hepatocytes, resulting in livermetabolic dysfunction and liver injurycis-stilbene glycoside Inhibit PPAR-γ pathway to induce idiotypic liver injuryemodin Inhibit the function of UGTs and MRP2 transporters to induce liver injuryemodin methyl ether The liver metabolites inhibit UGT1A1 enzymetrans-stilbene glycoside Metabolizing through UGTs mediated phase II pathway, inhibition of UGTs can lead to dysfunction of themetabolism, inducing liver injuryTABLE 2 Toxic components and toxic mechanisms of alcohol extract of PM.Alcohol extracttoxic components Toxic mechanismsaloe emodin reduce the survival rate of L02 cells and causes S phase block of hepatocyteschrysophanol Inhibit bile salt export pump and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 to accumulate endogenous BA in the liver, may be relatedto P450 1A2, P450 2B6 and P450 3A4 in hepatocytestetrahydroxy stilbene-O-(galloyl)-hex Unknown, lead to apoptosis of rat hepatocytesFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.14270193.2.1 StilbenesStilbenes, significant non-flavonoid phytochemicals with apolyphenolic structure, are prevalent in mosses and variousplants. Stilbenes can be used as medicine for their anti-oxidant,anti-proliferation and anti-inflammatory properties. However, theymay impair UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), potentiallyleading to drug-induced liver injury (DILI).The discovery of stilbenes in PM began in 1976 with thecharacterization of 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. Since then, many stilbenes were found, suchas 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside,rhaponticoside, physcion, emodin-8-O-glucoside etc. (Linet al., 2015) From 2015 to 2020, most of the new compoundsisolated are majorly dianthrones and stilbenes (Teka et al., 2021). In2016, four new dianthrones were isolated by Yang et al., namingpolygonumnolides C1-C4 from PM (Yang et al., 2016). Afterthe isolation of polygonumosides A-D in 2014, a new typeof stilbene, polygonumoside E was isolated and characterizedin 2016 (Yan et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016). Zhang andCui found a new stilbene with HPLC, and named it 2, 3,FIGURE 2Structures of chemical components 1–21 in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.14270195, 4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-(2″O-p-Phydroxybenzoyl)-β-D-glucoside (Zhang and Cui, 2016). In 2017, a new type ofpolygonimitin was named as thunberginol-C-6-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. Moreover, polygonumnolide D andpolygonumnolide E were found by Yang et al., 2017. The team ofYang continued their research and in 2018, they isolated seven newpolygonumnolides, naming polygonumnolide A1, A2, A3, A4, B1,B2 and B3 (Yang J. et al., 2018). In 2018, Li et al. isolated seven newFIGURE 3Structures of chemical components 22–34 in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019dimeric stilbenes named as multiflorumisides A-G (Li et al., 2018). Inthe next year, they isolated 5 new oligomeric stilbenes namingmultiflorumiside H-L, among which Multiflorumiside H and Jshowed moderate suppressive effect against nitric oxide production(Li et al., 2019). In 2020, Another research group isolated 9 newstilbenes, named them as polygonibene 1, polygonibene 2,polygonibene 2a, polygonibene 3, polygonibene 3a, andpolygonibene 4, 5, 6, and 7 (Nguyen et al., 2020) (Figures 2–4).3.2.2 QuinonesQuinones, which are abundant in nature, typically possess abasic structural pattern where ortho- or para-substituted diones areconjugated to an benzoquinone or to expanded polycyclic aromaticsystems. These compounds exert antioxidant-relatedpharmacological actions including neuroprotective effects, anti-inflammation, anticancer, hepatoprotective effects and anti-aging,etc. (Zhao and Zheng, 2023) However, quinones can lead to aninhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450 enzymes) andUGTs, resulting in hepatotoxicity.The first quinone identified in PM was 2-Methoxy-6-acethyl-7-methyliuglone, isolated in 1993. In subsequent research, Yanget al. isolated seven new polygonumnolides, including cis-emodindianthrone, in 2018 (Yang et al., 2018). In 2021, Yang et al. firstdeveloped the UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method to simultaneouslydetermine six dianthrones in PM, including trans-emodindianthrones, and cis-emodin dianthrones (Yang et al., 2021),marking a significant advancement in analyticaltechniques (Figure 5).3.2.3 Other componentsIn addition to quinones, PM also contains flavonoids andchromenones. Flavonoids, polyphenolic secondary metabolitesfound in various plants and diets, consist of a structuralbackbone of 15 carbon atoms and are composed of two benzenerings and heterocycles. These compounds exhibit multiple biologicalactivities, including antioxidant, cardio-protective, hepatocyte-protective, and anti-cancer effects, and are primarily recognizedfor their liver-protective properties.Two new types of chromenones, 2,5-dimethyl-7-hydroxychromone and 2-(2-hydroxylpropyl)-5-methylchromenone-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and one newtype of flavonoid, trycin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, wasisolated from PM in 2016 (Yan et al., 2014). With an effect ofprotecting liver, flavonoids may not be the toxic components inPM (Figure 6).Although the above components cause liver injury whenadministrated in large quantities, the quantity of components isvery low in the clinical dosage of PM. Therefore, polygonummultiflorum-induced liver injury (PM-DILI) may not beindependently caused by the above components. Thecomponents may play a secondary or synergistic role in theoccurrence of PM-DILI (Zhai et al., 2021). Recognition of thisFIGURE 4Structures of chemical components 35–43 in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019may contribute to a more complete understanding of thecomplex multi-component mechanisms of PM-DILI.4 The toxicity of PM4.1 The toxicity of PM ismainly recognized asliver injuryPM has been recognized as a toxic herb since the toxicity wasfirst reported by Hongkong scholars in 1996. The herb’s toxicityencompasses hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, andembryotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is linked to stilbenes andquinones, nephrotoxicity and embryotoxicity are mostlylinked to stilbenes. With hepatotoxicity being the mostsignificant, it manifests in three forms: intrinsic, idiosyncratic,and indirect toxicity (Xiao et al., 2023).Intrinsic toxicity refers to the predictable and dose-dependenteffects caused by the inherent toxic substances in PM. This type oftoxicity, which can be replicated in healthy animal models, is typicalof traditional herbs and can often be mitigated through conventionalprocessing methods. Idiosyncratic toxicity targets specific vulnerablepopulations and is linked to individual immune responses,metabolic processes, and genetic factors. This form of toxicity isless acknowledged in TCM, and its detoxification has not beenextensively studied. Indirect toxicity arises from thepharmacological impact of biologically active compounds. It ischallenging to replicate in animal models and remains an area ofongoing research (Table 3).4.1.1 Intrinsic toxicityIntrinsic toxicity, the most prevalent form of PM-DILI, ischaracterized by a dose-response relationship. This relationshipsuggests that within certain limits, the dosage of the drugcorrelates directly with its therapeutic effect, making theprediction and control of intrinsic toxicity more straightforward.Two primary components of PM, 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside and emodin (EMD), are chiefly responsible forthis toxicity. Intrinsic toxicity is mainly caused by the toxicity ofthese two components, with a series of characteristics. A study foundthat different dose concentration of emodin can increase theexpression of CYP2E1, 2B6, 1A2, 3A4, 2C9, 2D6, 7A1 mRNA,inducing the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in a dose-dependent manner (Wang et al., 2016). And emodin intake caninduce the enzymes of CYP1A, CYP2E1, and CYP2B (Wang et al.,2015). Emodin and emodin methyl ether have a strong inhibitoryeffect on CYP1A2, and a medium inhibitory effect on CYP2C9,CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (Zheng et al., 2021).While 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside alone doesnot exhibit hepatotoxicity, it exacerbates liver damage when combinedwith sub-toxic doses of acetaminophen (APAP) in mice. 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside aggravated hepatic reducedglutathione (GSH) depletion and APAP-cysteine adducts formationinduced by APAP in mice (Xu et al., 2017), showing that 2,3,5,4′-FIGURE 5Chemical structures of quinones in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside may exacerbates thehepatotoxicity caused by APAP. Another study investigated effects of2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside on the hepatotoxicitycaused by DEN. 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucosideinhibited liver injury and inflammatory cell infiltration in DEN-treated mice. Besides, 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucosideFIGURE 6Chemical structures of other components in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.TABLE 3 Comparison of intrinsic toxicity and idiosyncratic toxicity.Intrinsic toxicity Idiosyncratic toxicitycause Over-dose of usage Immunity, metabolism and genes of specific patientspopulation affected Affects all individuals Affects only susceptible individualsrelationship with dose used Dose-dependent Not dependent on doseclinically predictable Predictable and can be avoided Not predictablecourses after exposure Predictable courses of disease after exposure Variable courses of disease after exposureliver characteristics Distinctive liver toxicity Variable liver pathologyanimal models Predictable and can be copied within animal models Not able to be copied within animal modelsFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019also attenuated DEN-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species(ROS), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and DNA damage. Both the studyindicated that 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucosideexacerbates the hepatotoxicity induced by drugs inmice (Yu et al., 2020).Clinical symptoms of liver toxicity caused by PM are mainlyrelated to digestive system. Loss of appetite and oil aversion aretwo most emphasized symptoms. Growth of body mass is alsoreported in many studies. The liver fat growth may be moresevere in female than male, indicated in a liver pathologicalsection of rats fed with PM decoction for 3 months (Hu et al.,2009). Scholars found that transaminase and bilirubin (BIL)levels were higher in patients with liver injury caused by PM, andrelated jaundice is also detected in some patients. All the findingsindicated that PM may disturb the metabolism of transaminaseand BIL (Tang and Mei, 2017). BIL metabolism is related withUGT of phase II metabolism pathway, and among the isomers ofUGT, the core enzyme related to BIL metabolism is UGT1A1(Chang, 2020). Thus, PM may increase time of BIL metabolismby inhibiting enzyme UGT1A1 in phase II metabolism pathway(Zheng et al., 2021).4.1.2 Idiosyncratic toxicityIdiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) affects only asmall subset of the population with specific predispositions, anddoes not exhibit a dose-response relationship, making it clinicallyunpredictable. Unlike other forms of toxicity, IDILI does notcorrelate directly with drug dosage, and its underlyingpathophysiology remains poorly understood.The exact pathophysiology of IDILI is multi-factorial involvingdrug or pharmacological factors (lipophilicity, dose, etc.),environmental factors, and host factors (genetics, immunity,possibly microbiome) (Chen et al., 2013; Stephens et al., 2014).Over the past decade, studies have found that polymorphisms inHuman Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules are associated withmany drugs that cause IDILI, suggesting a role for the immunesystem in this pathology (Kaplowitz, 2013). HLA associations clearlypoint to the involvement of the adaptive immune system in IDILI(Dara et al., 2016).Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that PM-DILI is animmune-mediated idiosyncratic liver injury. Results showed that2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside isolated from PMcould activate CD4+T and CD8+T in the liver, and could upregulatethe levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-18,perforin and granzyme B in the liver tissues (Liu et al., 2024). BothPM water extract and cis-stilbene glucoside, the susceptibilitycomponent of hepatotoxicity, could cause hepatotoxicity in themice pre-stimulated with TNF-α (Zhang et al., 2022). Dose ofPM caused abnormal liver biochemical indicators and liver tissuedamage in MIS model rats (Tu et al., 2019).Recent attention has focused on IDILI triggered by LPS. Micepretreated with a modest inflammatory dose of LPS became susceptibleto intrinsic liver injury induced by nontoxic doses of APAP (Lai et al.,2018). With normal dose of PM engaged, HE staining of rats’ livershowed mild swelling and local chronic inflammation. The resultssuggest that PM-DILI induced by LPS is related to inflammation, andthis type of hepatotoxicity has no dose-dependence (Pang et al., 2015).Increased expression of cytokines and chemokines, activation ofinflammatory cells, depression of PPAR-γ pathway, and stimulationof the TLR-NF-κB pathway, all indicated that the innate immuneresponse may be involved with PM-DILI (Luyendyk et al., 2003; Denget al., 2006; Zou et al., 2009; Maddox et al., 2010). Several drugs causingIDILI in humans also induce IDILI in animals with a normal dose ofLPS, such as diclofenac, sulindac, ranitidine, amiodarone, halothane,and trovafloxacin (Zhu et al., 2019). Immunoinflammation mayregulate the susceptibility to IDILI.Additionally, TCM syndromes may influence PM-DILIsusceptibility. After feeding water extract of processed PM, the seruminflammatory mediator TNF-α content of the rats with kidney-yangdeficiency significantly increased. Processing of PM has certain liverdamage to kidney-yang deficiency model (Bywpgxolgfy, 2016).4.2 Central mechanisms of PM-DILI: Enzymedeficiency and inflammatory responseinterruptionEnzyme deficiency involves both CYP450 enzymes and UGTs,along with the presence of the HLA-B*35:01 gene in patients. Interms of drug effects, PM-DILI is characterized by disruptedinflammatory responses and impaired metabolism of BIL andbile acids (BA). As for the drugs, interrupting the inflammatoryresponse, BIL and BA metabolism are the main aspects.4.2.1 Deficiency of metabolism enzymesDrug metabolism pathway in vivo can be divided into phase Ⅰand phase Ⅱ (Ren et al., 2018). The metabolism of PM is mainlyassociated with CYP450 enzymes of the phase Ⅰ metabolism, andUGT enzymes of the phase Ⅱ metabolism (Figure 7).4.2.1.1 Phase Ⅰ metabolism pathwayCYP450 is an important enzyme in drug induced hepatotoxicity,vital for the process of phase Ⅰmetabolism pathway. The main role ofCYP450 is to make structural modifications to drug molecules, suchas adding a hydroxyl group to the molecular structure to make itmore hydrophilic. Many traditional Chinese medicine, PM included,induces or inhibits this enzyme, leading to the accumulation ofactive metabolic components of drugs, or leading to decreased drugefficacy, increased adverse reactions or toxicity (Mao et al., 2016).Metabolism of many drugs depends on CYP1A2, such asphenacetin, caffeine, clozapine, tacrine, propranolol and mexiletine,etc. (Hou et al., 2016) PM extractions can significantly decrease theactivity and mRNA expression of liver CYP1A2 enzyme (Guo et al.,2021). Another study found that genetic polymorphism of CYP1A2 inpatients with PM-DILI is different from that of normal people (Maet al., 2014). Thus, both the genetic polymorphism of CYP1A2 and theinhibition of PM on CYP1A2, leading to the accumulation of toxiccomponents, may be the mechanism of PM-DILI. Besides, differentprocessing methods of PM can lead to different regulation of mRNAexpression levels of drug metabolizing enzymes CYP2E1, CYP3A4 andCYP1A2 (Li et al., 2021). As a result, processing may affect theregulation of CYP450 enzymes, leading to detoxification of PM.4.2.1.2 Phase Ⅱ metabolism pathwayUGTs is the main metabolic catalytic enzyme in the phase Ⅱmetabolic reaction, metabolizing nearly 35% of drugs and inactivatethem. UGTs can transfer the glucuronic acid group of the cofactorFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) to the hydroxylgroup of drug molecules, so as to improve the water solubility ofdrugs and facilitate their excretion through urine or bile, leading tothe occurrence of PM-DILI (Yang et al., 2021).Glucanosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) is aphase Ⅱmetabolic enzyme in the liver. It is related to the catalyze ofunbound bilirubin (UCB), it can transform UCB into water-solubleBIL glucuronic acid conjugate, so that UCB can be secreted into bilefor elimination. PM has been observed to inhibit UGT1A1, a keyenzyme in BIL metabolism, thereby disrupting the conversion ofUCB into its water-soluble form and promoting its accumulation,which could lead to hepatotoxicity (Wang Q. et al., 2022).The toxicity of PMmay result frommore than one single pathway.Scholars found that themain components of PM such as emodin, rhein,emodin methyl ether, etc. had toxicity on liver cell through inhibitingthe activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 and competitively inhibiting theactivity of BIL rate-limiting enzymeUGT1A1 (Zheng andWang, 2019).Besides, there are studies demonstrated the mechanisms such as theinduction of apoptosis and the inhibition of liver cell proliferation. Lipidmetabolism, bile acid metabolism and energy metabolism are involved.Oxidative phosphorylation pathways is also related according toproteomics (Zhang et al., 2016). Functions of these pathways are stillunder cultivating (Zhu et al., 2019).4.2.2 Interruption of inflammatory responseInterruption of the inflammatory response is a key mechanismunderlying hepatotoxicity. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ(PPAR-γ), amember of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a criticalrole in modulating inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signalingpathways. PPAR-γ can inhibit NF-κB and STAT pathways,restraining inflammatory cells, retarding hepatotoxicity.Based on the model of LPS induced IDILI, He Lanzhi et al.(He et al., 2017) explored the effects of PM’s alcohol extract onhepatotoxicity. They discovered that toxicity might be linked tothe over-expression of inflammatory factors and the suppressionof the PPAR-γ pathway in vivo. PPAR-γ agonists can significantlyreduce the levels of ALT and AST in rats plasma, alleviatingpathological injury and hepatocyte apoptosis, significantlypromote the expression of PPAR-γ and inhibit the expressionof NF-κB p65 in liver tissue. Thus, the abnormal decrease ofPPAR-γ and the over expression of inflammatory factors maylead to the hepatotoxicity, and PPAR-γmay be the target point ofPM-DILI.Furthermore, activation of the TLR4/IRF-3 signaling pathwayhas also been implicated in PM-DILI. Unlike dose-dependentmechanisms, hepatotoxicity here is associated with the expressionlevels of proteins in the TLR4/IRF-3 pathway (Xue et al., 2020).4.2.3 Genetic risk factorIn the last decade, numerous genome-wide association studies(Kaliyaperumal et al., 2018) have linked human leukocyte antigens(HLAs) to IDILI susceptibility. Scholars found that the HLA-B*35:01 allele is a genetic risk factor for PM-DILI and a potentialbiomarker for predicting PM-DILI in humans (Lin et al., 2017).Three models have been put out for the possible mechanisms of Tcell-mediated drug hypersensitivity regulated by HLA: the hapten/prohapten model, the pharmacological interaction model and thealtered peptide repertoire model (Yun et al., 2012; Uetrecht andFIGURE 7Central mechanisms of hepatotoxicity of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. are recognized as the inhibition on CYP450 enzymes the decrease ofPPAR-γ, and the inhibition of UGTs.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019Naisbitt, 2013; Redwood et al., 2018). The hapten/prohapten model isthe main hypothesis, and is widely studied. Other two hypothesis mayact as an alteration to the hapten/prohapten model. As one of the HLA-associated forms of DILI, the mechanism of PM-DILI is associated withthe interaction between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells.After the metabolism of toxic components in the liver, the metabolitescan be taken by dendritic cells (DCs), forming adducts covalently withself-proteins, processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering thematuration of DCs. HLA-B*35:01 molecules then present the adducts atthe surface of cells, waiting for the activation of CD8+T cells byinteracting with T cell receptors (TCRs) (Rodriguez-Pena et al., 2006;Megherbi et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2018).Besides, FXR gene may also be related to PM-DILI. Scholarsscreened and verified that the hepatotoxic components aloe emodin-8-O-β-D-glucoside and emodin-8-O-β-D-glucoside in PM couldsignificantly inhibit FXR gene expression through moleculardocking and in vitro cytotoxicity tests.In conclusion, genemechanisms of hepatotoxicity of PM varies alot, most of the studies emphasize the alterations of drug-metabolizing enzymes as the main mechanism, Immune-RelatedGene Polymorphism, BIL-BAmetabolism pathway and HLA relatedT cell-mediated drug hypersensitivity are also importantmechanisms.5 Traditional processing anddetoxification of PMTraditional Chinese Medicine has utilized various processingmethods for decades. There are many processing methods for PM:Wen PE, nine cycles of steaming and sunning, stewing, steaming,etc. Processing is often incorporating with various excipients tomodify the herb’s chemical profile and reduce toxicity. Afterprocessing, chemical components in PM changed, thus lead to areduction in toxicity. What’s more, both the methods of processingand excipients added can detoxify PM, as well as increase the effectof it (Figure 8).5.1 Processing detoxification can detoxifyPM by changing its chemical componentsProcessing significant increased content of polysaccharide in PM.Results showed that raw PM and processed PM both comprised Man,Rha, GlcA, GalA, Glc, Ara and Xyl, but markedly differed inpolysaccharide yield, molar ratio of monosaccharide compositionand Glc/GalA (Wang et al., 2023). The fingerprint ofmonosaccharide composition also demonstrated that Glc and GalAcould be used as differential markers (Gu et al., 2022). It was found thatthe addition of black beans and steaming times would affect the contentand composition of polysaccharide in PM significantly (Fanet al., 2024).The content of 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside decreased after processing. Researchers found thatduring the processing, maillard reaction occurred, producing alarge number of compounds, including acetone alcohol, 2, 3-butanediol, succinic acid, 2, 3-dihydro-3, 5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyranone (DDMP), 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) andits derivatives. 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucosidewas converted into a series of derivatives through theesterification reaction with small molecular compounds.Resveratrol was the intermediate product of 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, which washydroxylated to form terahydroxystilbene, and thenglycosylated to form 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside. The representative herbal components trans-2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside andcyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside from each herbal medicine wereFIGURE 8The most widely used processing method: nine times of steaming and sunning.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019selected to investigate the processing mechanism at thesupramolecular level (Bai et al., 2022). The co-assembly of 2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside thatleads to supramolecular aggregates discovered here may implythe underlying mechanism of processing PM with black beans(Liu et al., 2023). After nine cycles of steaming, the amount ofstilbenes and combined quinones decreased (Zheng et al., 2021).There are some other components different in raw PM andprocessed PM. High-performance liquid chromatography studieson different processing methods reveal that stewing PM leads tothe hydrolysis of combined quinones into their free forms,thereby diminishing the herb’s toxicity (Ding et al., 2023).Main components of PM such as 2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, emodin methyl ether and emodin increasedsignificantly (Liu MJPJ. et al., 2020). Five compounds weredifferent in raw and processed PM: α-arabinose, α-galactose,proline, isomer of daidzein and isomer of genistein, whichmay be potential active ingredients that affect the processingof PM (Chen et al., 2021). Quinones can be decomposed intogallic acid, resulting in an increase in the content after processing.After processing, gallic acid substances in PM increased, and theproportion of quinones decreased. Tannins in PM would bedestructed with processing, and may be converted into gallicacid, which further increased the proportion of gallic acid in PM(Ke et al., 2021) (Table 4).Wen PE, a unique method of PM processing, was firstdocumented in “Pao Zhi Da Fa,” and it was only passed downin Jianchangbang. The processing method is to take the PM slices,soak them, add black beans, put them in a boiled medicine jar,add warm water, cover them, simmer them for 48 h, take themout, dry them, and sieve them to remove the black bean dregs;Then mix well with yellow wine, wait for exhaustion, steam for6 h, stop the fire and seal it overnight, take it out, and dry it.Researchers found that the amount of emodin-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside、torachrysone-8-O-β-D-glucopyranoside、emodin 8-O-(6′-methylmalonyl)-glucopyranoside andphyscion-8-O-β-D-monoglucoside decreased in Wen PE, andAST, ALT, LDH, GGT decreased in vivo, indicating that Wenprocessing decreased the hepatotoxicity in PM (Ding et al., 2022).Processing detoxification can decrease the toxicity of PMwith orwithout excipients. Black soybeans processing is the most widelyused. With the excipients of black beans, 12 components changedsignificantly: Free quinones decreased first and increased as thesteaming time extending. Quinones, cis-2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, polydatin and hypericinincreased first and then decreased. Amount of trans-2,3,5,4′-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, resveratrol, epicatechinand rutin all decreased (Zhu et al., 2019). Li Yanyi et al. (Liet al., 2023) also found that the content of stilbene glycoside,quinone, flavonoid decreased after processing, while the amountof phenol increased. In a conclusion, steaming with black soybeanscan not only decrease the hepatotoxicity, but also increase themedicinal value of PM.Except for black soybean juice, there are some otherexcipients that have been investigated. Different processingexcipients can lead to different levels of stilbene glycoside andfree quinone. Processing of black soybean juice and ginger juicelead to the highest contents of stilbene glycoside and freequinone, the processing of rice swill with black soybean juicereflected the lowest level of stilbene glycoside, and the content offree quinone was the lowest in the procession of black soybeanwith Rehmannia glutinosa DC. juice (Li et al., 2020). Researchersalso found that rice swill could be excipient for detoxification(BX, 2017; Liu et al., 2020), jujubes are also standard excipientsfor detoxification (Liu et al., 2020). The content of stilbeneglycoside in boiled PM is the highest, meaning that the threemethods of processing can all effectively retain the activeingredients of PM, while rice swill is the best (BX, 2017).5.2 Processing detoxification can detoxifyPM as well as increase its efficacyRepeated processing, particularly through nine cycles ofsteaming and sunning, significantly alters the chemicalcomposition of PM, thus lead to a decrease in toxicity and anincrease in efficacy (Liang et al., 2018).In vivo, results showed that raw PM and processed PM bothexerted hepatoprotective effects by upregulating antioxidantenzymes and repressing lipid peroxidation, and that thepolysaccharide yield of processed PM was seven-fold higher thanthat of raw PM, demonstrating that processed PM has betterhepatoprotective effects at the same dose of decoction (Wanget al., 2023). Researchers also found that the immunomodulatoryactivity of processed PMwas significantly better than that of raw PM(Gu et al., 2022).In vitro, more cycles of steaming and sunning can lead to alower serum ALT and AST in rats, due to lower percentage ofstilbenes in processed PM (Zheng et al., 2021). The TBIL andDBIL levels decreased gradually with the increase of steamingand sunning times, suggesting that multiple steaming andsunning may result in a protection for the metabolism oftransaminase and bilirubin (Gao et al., 2022). Moreover, it hasbeen reported that processing could increase the amount ofphenylethyl olefinic glycoside, increase the effects ofprotecting nerves, improving memory, anti-aging, decreasingTABLE 4 Chemical components before and after processing.Chemical components Changes after processingpolysaccharides The contents of monosaccharides and disaccharides decreased, the total content of carbohydrates increased, and the molecular weightof PM polysaccharides decreasedstilbene glycosides The overall content of stilbene glycosides decreased, the proportion of trans/cis-stilbene glycosides decreased, and the amount of cis-stilbene glycosides increasedquinones The content of emodin decreases, emodin methyl ether increases, gallic acid content increasesFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Qian et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1427019blood lipid and so on, thus stewing can not only decrease thetoxicity, but can also increase the benefits of PM (Wanget al., 2022).Mechanisms of processing is still under investigation. ProcessingPM with black beans could significantly decrease the apoptosis rateof L02 cells, indicating that the detoxification may related toapoptosis (Chen et al., 2021). Huang Chaowen et al. (Huanget al., 2023) explored the mechanism of PM detoxifying, andresults showed that processing of PM can decrease thehepatotoxicity by decreasing autophagy, which may provide newinterventions for the detoxification.5.3 Compatible detoxification is aconvenient way of detoxifying and istraditionally used in clinical practiceCompatible detoxification is one of the traditional Chinesemedicinedetoxification methods. It means that one kind of Chinese medicine isused together with another or more kinds of Chinese medicine, so as toachieve the purpose of inhibiting or eliminating the toxicity of Chinesemedicine. This approach has been shown to alleviate PM-DILI whenused with substances such as cistanche polysaccharides, brown algaloligosaccharides, and chito-oligosaccharides (Ren et al., 2021).Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst. was used for biologicaldetoxification of tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside-induced idiosyncratichepatotoxicity of PM (Lin et al., 2021). Scholars have also studied thecompatibility of PM with Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf and Glycyrrhizauralensis Fisch., results showed that the compatibility of PM and Poriacocos (Schw.) Wolf is better in detoxification (Pang et al., 2015).Compatible detoxification is a convenient way of detoxifying, the twomethods of detoxification is usually conducted together in clinicalpractice, while mechanism of them is worth investigation (Table 5).6 ConclusionSignificant advancements have been made in understanding thepharmacology, toxicology, and processing detoxification of PM.Within the aspect of pharmacology, medications of PM havebeen cultivated since the usage by the ancient Chinese. It iswidely used nowadays in the protection from aging, insomniaand hair-losing. Researcher found that PM is mainly consist ofstilbenes, quinones and flavonoids. Stilbenes can lead to adysfunction of UGTs, resulting in IDILI. Quinones can lead to aninhibition of CYP450 enzymes and UGTs, resulting inhepatotoxicity. As a dietary component, flavonoids are thought tohave beneficial effects on human health. Their health-promotingproperties are associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, andanticancer properties (Serafini et al., 2010; Procházková et al., 2011;Kumar and Pandey, 2013; Gontijo et al., 2017; Dobrzynska et al.,2020). Flavonoids have a function of protecting liver, which means itmay be the protecting components of PM. Within the aspect oftoxicology, water extract and alcohol extract of raw and preparedPM have been explored, and more than 103 components, includingflavonoids, phospholipids, quinones, stilbenes, have been isolatedand characterized. Hepatotoxicity is the main aspect of toxicity ofPM, intrinsic toxicity and idiosyncratic toxicity can affect the liverfunction through mechanisms of metabolism enzymes,inflammatory response and genetic risk factors. Within the aspectof processing detoxification, nine cycles of steaming and sunning,and different types of stewing can change the components in PM,resulting in decreased toxicity and enhanced efficiency. Compatibledetoxification is also one of the specific ways of detoxification inTCM, with a convenience in usage, it is commonly applied inclinical practice.In traditional Chinese medicine, PM is widely used for nourishingliver and kidney, tonifying blood, anti-aging and blackening hair.Ancient Chinese use raw PM to treat postpartum fever, and processPM with various excipients of Yellow Rice Wine, black soybean juice,swill, and jujube juice, etc. to treat hair losing, forgetfulness, headache,sores and ulcers. Processed PM is decreased in toxicity and ismaximum in pharmacologic effects. However, with multi-targetsand multi-components, the exact mechanism of processed PM andthe pharmacokinetics in vivo are still worth investigating. Updatingthe research paradigm from the current “one target, one drug” modeto a new “network target, multi-components” mode, TCM networkpharmacology approach provides a new research paradigm fortranslating TCM from an experience-based medicine to anevidence-based medicine system, which will accelerate TCM drugdiscovery, and also improve current drug discovery strategies (Li andZhang, 2013; Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022c).Different aspects of toxicity on PM have been reported,including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and embryotoxicity,of which hepatotoxicity is the most important. Based on anexamination of the literature, we speculate that the possibleTABLE 5 Compatibility of PM and compatible effects.Compatibility of PM Compatible effectsporia cocos (Schw.)

Firstly, the over-dose of usage may lead tointrinsic toxicity, resulting in the binding of drugs and their RMto host proteins, the depletion of antioxidant systems such asGSH, the activation of stress kinases, the release of strongoxidizing groups such as ROS from mitochondrial stress andmitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, aswell as the activation of the innate immune system and localinflammatory response of the liver. Secondly, immunity,metabolism and genes of specific patients affects susceptibleindividuals, leading to idiosyncratic toxicity, resulting inincreased expression of cytokines and chemokines, activationof inflammatory cells, depression of PPAR-γ pathway, andstimulation of the TLR-NF-κB pathway.Indirect liver injury is a kind of drug liver injury caused bythe action of the drug rather than by its toxic or idiosyncraticproperties, the mechanism of injury is that drugs indirectly causeliver injury by changing the patient’s original liver disease orimmune status (Hoofnagle and Björnsson, 2019), which can becaused by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), glucocorticoids,monoclonal antibodies, etc. At present, there have been noreports of indirect liver injury caused by PM, and it is worthexploring whether PM can cause indirect liver injury.Therefore, proper dosage, extractions and components ofPM, effects as well as toxicity of PM are still need to be verified.Given the diverse toxicological profiles observed, includinghepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and embryotoxicity, furtherresearch is essential. Mechanisms of traditional processingand compatible detoxification are worth explored. Changes ofchemical components before and after processing, as well aschanges of chemical components before and after compatibilityare need to be deeply researched.Author contributionsJQ: Investigation, Methodology, Writing–original draft,Writing–review and editing.
