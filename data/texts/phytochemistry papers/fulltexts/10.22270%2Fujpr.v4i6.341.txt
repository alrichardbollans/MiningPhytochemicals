ETHNOBOTANY, PHYTOCHEMISTRY AND PHARMACOLOGY OF OCHNA 
SCHWEINFURTHIANA: A REVIEW 
Abstract 
Ochna schweinfurthiana(Os, Family: Ochnaceae) is a small evergreen tree used in 
ethnomedicine to treat different ailments; it is also used in agri-horticulture and as ornaments, 
dyes among others. Chemical investigations conducted on the different parts of the plant have 
been confined to phenolic compounds majorly bioflavonoids, glycosides, steroids and terpenes. 
The plant, Os have shown a wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological properties which 
include antimicrobial, cytotoxic/antiproliferative, genotoxicity, antinociceptive, anti-
inflammatory, antioxidant and antiplasmodial. This review comprehensively summarize the 
potential effects of the plant Os chemically and pharmacologically (in vitro and in vivo). 
However, more researches in the aspect of phytochemical and biological studies are needed to 
exhaustively isolate bioactive compounds and evaluate their effects on other ailments as claimed 
by the traditional healers. 
Keywords: Ochnaceae, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, antiplasmodial,

1. Introduction 
Ochna schweinfurthiana(Os)belonging to the Ochnaceaefamily is a small tree that was named 
after a German botanical collector and taxonomist Dr. Georg August Schweinfurth; it is an 
attractive tropical small tree that measures up to 4 m tall and the plant is commonly known as the 
brick-red Ochna in English, Jan-taru in Hausa language, Hiéké in Yoruba and Sa’aboule in 
Foufouldé (Burkill, 1985; Messi et al., 2016).The plant can be used as medicine, for agricultural, 
social and religious purposes (Burkill, 1985). This review will focus on the phytochemical and 
pharmacological properties of Os. 
2. Main text 
2.1 Botanical Description 
Ochna originated from a Greek word “Ochnewhich means wild pear”. It was named by Linnaeus 
in 1951 as Ochna because of the resemblance of their leaves with those of wild pear (Muema, 
2015). Itis an old world genus of mainly trees, shrubs and shrublets which comprises of about 85 
species (Verdcourt, 2005) and it is widely distributed widely in tropical Asia, Africa and 
America (Rendle, 1952) of which eleven (11) species occur in India (Kirtikar, 2012). Ochna’s 
are usually called Mickey Mouse plants, as a result of the appearance of their black druplets 
fruits sitting.The Ochnaceaefamily is mainly comprised of trees and shrubs with about 33 genera 
and 550 species  (Christenhusz and Byng, 2016) which are highly distributed around the globe; 
the species are mostly found in Tropical Africa, Asia, Australia, Madagascar, the Mascarene 
island and America (Mabberley, 2008). They are notably known for their unusual leaves that are 
shiny, with closely spaced, parallel veins, toothed margins, and conspicuous stipules (Burkill, 
1985; Christenhusz and Byng, 2016). The largest genera are Ouratea, 
Ochna,Campylospermum,SauvagesiaandQuiinawith(200, 85, 65, 39 and 34 species) respectively 
(Table 1).

2.2 Morphology 
O.schweinfurthiana is a shrub or small evergreen treethat grows up to 4 m tall and it has a dark 
grey bark that is fissured and cracked, separating into square segments (Hyde et al., 2019). The 
leaves are olive-green (1-13.5 x 1.7-5.5cm)that oblanceolate to oblong or elliptic, apex somewhat 
rounded, base tapers into the petiole, margins rather bluntly toothed (serrulate), sometimes 
appearing almost scalloped, net-veining conspicuous on the upper surface and young leaves are 
coppery (Burkill, 1985; Anonymous, 2019).It bears bright yellow flowers (1.5 cm diameter) 
which are sweetly-scented from September to November, very short-lived, normally appearing 
before or with the young leaves (Hyde et al., 2019). In addition, it appeared in a condensed 
receme with 4 – 10 flowers on a short central stem and the petals fall very early (Anonymous, 
2019). The fruits of Osare 1-5 ovalappear between August and January, attached at the base are 2 
– 4 black berries when ripe; they are enlarged, borne on brick-red persistent sepals turning cherry 
to brick-red. The bark is dark grey, thick, and deeply fissured into a grid-like pattern 
(Anonymous, 2019; Hyde et al., 2019).

3. Uses  
3.1 Ethnomedicinal uses 
Several preparations (powdered and decoction) of the leaves and/or root of the Os have found a 
general use as an antimicrobial (wound dressing, eye infection), analgesic, anti-inflammatory and 
anthelmintic agents (Burkill, 1985). The leaf is also used as a laxative, enema, febrifuge, 
antiseptic, stimulant, among others (Burkill, 1985). In Northern Cameroon, Os is used to treat 
  
 
different metabolic diseases such as rubella, burns, stomachache and multiple sclerosis 
(Abdullahi et al., 2010); the root of the plant is also used to treat headache, stomach and eye 
aches while the leaves are used in the treatment of toothaches (Messiet al., 2016). 
The powdered bark is used as antimalarial, febrifuges and anthelminthic, while the decoction of 
the root, leaves or bark is used in dressing wounds (Abdullahi et al., 2010). In Northern Nigeria, 
the plant is used for the treatment of measles, typhoid fever and fungal skin infections (Abdullahi 
et al., 2010). The macerated roots of Os has been reportedly used to induce/speed the delivery 
process and for miscarriage (Bruschiet al., 2011). 
3.2 Other uses 
The plant is used in agri-horticulture; the bark and flowers Osare cultivated for ornaments, dyes, 
stains, inks, tattoos and mordent among others. The wood is used for farming, forestry, hunting 
and fishing apparatus. The leaf has social, religious, superstitious and magic values among others 
(Burkill, 1985). 
4. Phytochemistry 
4.1 Phytochemical screening 
Abdullahi et al.(2010)reported the presence of flavonoids, steroids/terpenes and saponins in the 
acetone leaf extract of Os and the methanol leaf extract indicated the presence of flavonoids and 
saponins. However, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, tannins and steroids/terpenes were reported 
on the methanol stem extract of Os(Danmusaet al., 2015).A study conducted by Ibrahim et al. 
(2015) reported the presence of carbohydrates, steroids/triterpenes, glycosides, saponins, tannins 
and flavonoids in the methanol leaf extract of Os. 
4.2 Bioactive constituents 
The main bioactive constituents isolated from Os fall under the following class of secondary 
metabolites; phenolic – flavonoids,glycosides and sugars. 
Os have been reported to contain phenolic derivatives (such as flavonoids, bioflavonoids)which 
appear as free or in polymerized forms. Isolation and characterization of quercetin-3-O-β-D-
glucopyronosyl-(1→6)-α-rhamnoside (1) (quercetin rutinoside) from the n-butanolsoluble 
fraction of methanolicleaf extract of Os was reported (Abdullahi et al., 2011). A novel 
compound, tri-methoxy lophirone (2) was isolated from the chloroform soluble fraction of the 
methanol root extract of Os (Abdullahi et al., 2014). 
Ndongoet al. (2015)reported the isolation of seven flavonoids, hemerocallone (3), 6,7-
dimethoxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavone(4), amentoflavone (5), agathisflavone (6), cupressuflavone 
(7), robustaflavone (8), and epicatechin (9), and three other compounds including, 
lithospermoside (10), β-D-fructofuranosyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (11) and 3β-O-D-
glucopyranosyl-β-stigmasterol (12) from the ethyl acetate extract of the stem bark of Os. 
The roots of Os were reported to contain three new compounds viz; 4'''-methoxylophirone A 
(13), 4,4',4'''–trimethoxylophirone A (14) and (4E,7Z)-3,8-dicarboxy-1-(O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-
(1→6)-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2,9-dihydroxyhexeicosa-4,7-diene (15). Six known compounds 
were also identified, including calodenone (16), calodenine B (17), lophirone A (18), 
gerontoisoflavone A (19), 16α,17-dihydroxy-ent-kauran-19-oic acid (20) and 3β-O-D-
glucopyranosyl-β-sitosterol (21) (Messiet al., 2016). 
Six known compounds were isolated from the powdered bark of Os and they include, 
hemerocallone (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-3'-4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (4), lithospermoside (10), 
amentoflavone (5), agathisflavone (6) and 𝛽-D-fructofuranosyl-𝛼-D-glucopyranoside (11) 
(Djovaet al., 2019).

5 Biological and Pharmacological activities 
5.1 Antimicrobial activity 
The acetone and methanol leaf extracts of Os had a remarkable antibacterial effect against S. 
aureus, S. typhi, K. pneumonia and P. aeruginosa with a mean zone of inhibition range of 15 – 
21 mm; the extracts had an MIC and MBC values of 10 – 20 mg/mL and 20 – 40 mg/mL, 
respectively (Abdullahi et al., 2010). 
Quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl(16)-α-rhamnoside(1) from the n-butanol soluble fraction 
of methanolic leaf extract of Os showed an in vitro inhibitory effect against some bacterial 
isolates such as S. aureus,MRSA, S. pyogenes, E. coli,K. pneumonia, S. typhiandP. aeruginosa 
with an MIC and MBC range between 2.5 – 5.0 and 5 – 20 µg/mL, but there was no effect 
against B.subtilis, C.ulceransand C.albicans (Abdullahi et al., 2011). 
Earlier studies showed that tri-methoxy lophirone A (2) from the chloroform soluble fraction of 
the methanol root extract of Os inhibited the growth of some selected human pathogens 
including S. aureus, S. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and S. typhi with an MIC and 
MFC values of 5 µg/mL and 20 µg/mL (Abdullahi et al., 2014). 
Crude methanol stem extract of Os and its chloroform (CF), ethylacetate (EF) and n-butanol 
(BF) fractions inhibited the growth of MRSA, S. aureus, S.pyogenes, S. typhi,S. dysenteriae, K. 
  
 
pneumonia, N.gonnorhea,P. aeruginosa, C. albican, C. tropicalis; the mean zone of inhibition of 
extract and fractions ranges from 20 – 29 mm; moreover, chloroform fraction showed greater 
antimicrobial activity with an MIC value of 1.25 mg/mL against all the test organisms except P. 
aeruginosa (Danmusaet al., 2015). 
5.2 Cytotoxic and Antiproliferative effect 
The methanol and ethylacetate stem bark extracts of Os demonstrated cytotoxicity against HeLa 
cells; amentoflavone (5) and agathisflavone (6) were also active (Ndongoet al., 2015). 
Antiproliferative effect of Osextract was evaluated against Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM U-
1242 MG) cell line and the extract reduce cell count by 20 % with an IC50 value 823.51 µg/mL 
(Abdullahi et al., 2016). 
The aqueous stem bark of Os did not show any cytotoxic effect on Vero monkey kidney cell line 
after 48 h incubation with an LC50 value 50±1 µg/mL (Djovaet al., 2019). 
5.3 Genotoxicity 
Djovaet al. (2019) reported that the extracts of Oswere nongenotoxic in a study he carried out; 
this is because none of the plant extracts demonstrated a dose dependent increase or revertent 
colonies ≥ the number of negative control revertent colonies; thus, the plantOs is devoid of any 
genotoxic substances that can lead to mutations either by substitution or by reversion in the 
genetic material.  
5.4 Antinoceptive and Anti-inflammatoryeffect 
The methanol leaf extract of Os significantly inhibited the writhing response induced by acetic 
acid in a dose dependent manner; the highest dose exhibited maximum inhibition of pain (84.3 
%). In addition, the extract was also able to attenuate pain response in a similar manner though 
with a slower onset of action in the tail flick model (Ibrahim et al., 2015a). 
The aqueous bark extract of Os exhibited good anti-inflammatory effect in both ferrous 
oxidation-Xylenol Orange (Fox) and BSA denaturation assays; the extract demonstrated good 
15-lipoxygenase inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of 32.2±0.36µg/mL, however, an IC50 of 
130±5.78µg/mL was recorded by the extract in the inhibition of heat induced albumin 
denaturation (Djovaet al., 2019). 
5.5 Antioxidant effect 
Messiet al. (2016) evaluated the antioxidant activity ofsome compounds including 4'''-
methoxylophirone A (13), calodenone (16), calodenine B (17), lophirone A (18), 
gerontoisoflavone A (19) from the roots of Osusing DPPH radical scavenging and ferric 
reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. In the DPPH radical scavenging, calodenine B (17) 
showed prominent effect with SC50 = 0.17±0.04 µM and EC50 = 4.25 µM,gerontoisoflavone A 
(19) exhibited weak activity in all the models applied with SC50 = 19.00 µM and SC50 = 78.67 µg 
EAA/mg/dw in DPPH and FRAP respectively. 
The antioxidant property of the leaf, stem bark and fraction of Os was conducted (Nyegueet al., 
2016). 
5.6 Antiplasmodial effect 
An in vivo study showed that the methanol leaf extract of Osexerted a suppressive effect against 
Plasmodium berghei at a lower dose (50 mg/kg); Ibrahim et al. (2015b) concluded that, the 
ability of the extract to suppress malaria at the early stage is an indication that, it possess blood 
schizonticidal activity. Moreso, the extract reduced the level of parasitaemia with 100 % cure at 
the lowest dose (50 mg/kg); the percentage inhibition of parasitaemia was higher than the chemo 
suppression due to non-selectivity of the extract to the proliferative process of the parasite 
(Salawuet al., 2010; Ibrahim et al., 2015b). 
  
 
Antiplasmodial effect of the ethylacetate roots extract of Os and some compounds 4'''-
methoxylophirone A (13),(4E,7Z)-3,8-dicarboxy-1-(O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-O-β-D-
glucopyranosyl-2,9-dihydroxyhexeicosa-4,7-diene (15), calodenine B (17), lophirone A (18) and 
gerontoisoflavone A (19) were investigated in vitro; 4''-methoxylophirone A (13) showed good 
antiplasmodial effect against Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7; this effect as explained by 
Messiet al. (2016) might be related to the presence of a methoxy group on position C-4''' which 
has been known to enhance lipophilicity thereby enhancing its  movement into the cells (Monks 
et al., 2002); other compounds were inactive (Messiet al., 2016). 
Cold and hot aqueous leaf extracts of Os possess inhibitory effect against P. falciparum in vitro; 
thus there was significant reduction of parasitaemia. The high dose (80 µg/mL) exhibited 86.42 
% (cold extract) and 85.06 % (hot extract) reduction of parasitaemia. On the other hand, no any 
significant difference was observed on the plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (PLDH) activity of 
the treated extract when compared with the standard drug (Omoniwa, 2017). 
5.7 Toxicity 
Toxicity level of Os was assessed in mice both orally and intraperitoneally. The methanol leaf 
extract of the plant produced an LD50 774.6 mg/kg, i. p. while the oral LD50 value for the extract 
was 5000 mg/kg; according to this study, the plant is toxic intraperitoneally and safe orally 
(Ibrahim et al., 2015b). 
Conclusion 
Os exhibit a variety of biological effects; the plant is considered to be effective against cancer, 
malaria, oxidative stress, pain, inflammation and a wide range of microbes; thus, the 
pharmacological actions have been attributed to the presence of different classes of secondary 
metabolites such as biflavonoids, glycosides, steroids and terpenes among other. In addition, the 
mechanism of action of the observed effects and evaluation of other pharmacological properties 
of Os still need attention and it should be the objective of new researches on Os.
