It has a long history of traditional uses in folk medicine totreat respiratory diseases, wounds, and burns and to relieve migraine, rheumatism, andmuscular pains. Despite numerous scientific studies shading light on the phytochemicalprofile and on the beneficial properties of the plant extracts, a comprehensive overviewof the current knowledge is missing. In this paper, we summarized the available infor-mation on botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties ofHypericum hircinum from peer-reviewed articles published till March 2025 in PubMed, Sci-enceDirect, Wiley, Springer, ACS, Scielo, and Web of Science databases. The presenceof numerous valuable compounds, including terpenes, phenolic acids, flavonoids, andphloroglucinols, is reported as well as the wide range of pharmacological properties, suchas antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antidepressant, anti-collagenase, anti-α-glucosidase,and antioxidant activities, together with non-pharmacological properties. The data re-ported in this review contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological properties ofthe species and pave the way for further investigation of its potential applications.Keywords: Hypericum hircinum; Hypericum; traditional uses; phenols; essential oils;antimicrobial; pharmacology1. IntroductionThe genus Hypericum (Hypericaceae family) includes more than 500 species distributedall over the world, with a center of species richness in Eurasia [1,2].Plants belonging to the genus Hypericum are well known in the traditional medicineof several countries, where they are used for the treatment of pathological conditionssuch as mild depression, wounds and burns, diarrhea, pain, fevers, and poisoning fromvenomous animal bites [3]. The traditional Chinese medicine, one of the oldest andmost well-structured, utilizes 64 species of Hypericum, including 33 endemic Chinesespecies, like H. sampsonii Hance, together with species more widely distributed likeHypericum attenuatum Fisch. ex Choisy, Hypericum erectum Thunb., Hypericum japonicumThunb., and Hypericum scabrum L. [3,4].Hypericum species are very popular as ailments also in the European folk medicine.The Mediterranean Basin, hosting more than 150 Hypericum taxa, is considered a hot spotof diversity for this genus [5]. Out of all the Hypericum species, Hypericum perforatum L.is one of the most studied plants in the world and is also considered the most importantPlants 2025, 14, 1451 https://doi.org/10.3390/plants14101451Plants 2025, 14, 1451 2 of 17medicinal plant of the 20th century [6]. It is included in the European, Chinese, andIndian pharmacopoeias, and it is commonly used for the treatment of mild depression [2].Numerous products based on H. perforatum L. extracts are available on the market, andto meet the demand for raw material, the species is cultivated on a large scale not onlyin Europe [7]. The species has also been the subject of biotechnological research mainlyfocused on the development of protocols for micropropagation and the production ofsecondary metabolites.Many other Mediterranean species have been proven to be valuable sources of bioac-tive compounds for treating diverse pathological conditions with potential, even superiorto those of H. perforatum L. [5,8]. The species include H. androsaemum L., showing diuretic,hepatoprotective, and antidepressant properties; H. calycinum L. with antioxidant andbeneficial effects on the nervous system; and H. origanifolium Willd. with anti-aging andanxiolytic effects [9–11].However, due to the broad spectrum of beneficial properties of the genus, the inves-tigation of scarcely distributed or endemic species represents an unexplored, abundant,and reliable source of pharmacologically active metabolites for exploitation in the pharma-ceutical and cosmeceutical industry. Among the scarcely distributed species, H. hircinumL., exclusively present in the Mediterranean basin, is an interesting medicinal plant at-tracting the interest of the scientific community, as evidenced by the increasing number ofpublications registered in the last 25 years.The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the availableknowledge on the botany, traditional uses, chemical profile, and pharmacological andnon-pharmacological activity of H. hircinum L. based on scientific reports and evidence.Through the review of 73 articles, chosen according to the process illustrated inFigure 1, a detailed chemical profile of essential oils and phenolic compounds has beenmade available, together with a description of traditional uses and pharmacological ac-tivities, providing valuable insight into the potential of H. hircinum for therapeutic use.Considerations on future challenges and investigations are also reported.Plants 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 18   Hypericum species are very popular as ailments also in the European folk medicine.

According to the current classification, H. hircinum L. is taxonomically placed in the Androsaemum section and shows a high tendency to hybridize with similar taxa [5]. Based on morphological traits, five subspecies of H. hircinum L. can be distinguished [16]: • H. hircinum subsp. albimontanum (Greuter) N. Robson found in Cyprus and some Greek Islands (Samos, Andros, Crete). • H. hircinum subsp. cambessedesii (Nyman) Sauvage endemic to the Balearic Islands. • H. hircinum subsp. hircinum native to Sardinia (Italy) and Corsica (France). • H. hircinum subsp. metroi (Maire and Sauvage) Sauvage native to Morocco. • H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson, widely distributed and often cultivated in gardens, regarded as the most primitive form of H. hircinum L., mainly occurring in Southern Italy (mostly in Sicily) and Crete. To our knowledge there are no published scientific articles on the domestication or cultivation of H. hircinum L.

Traditional UsesThe use of H. hircinum L. as a medicinal plant dates to Ancient Greece. The species isreported as a member of the Hippocratic medicinal flora of Kos Island, being one of theherbs on which Hippocrates’ healing practices were based [17].In Italy, H. hircinum L. preparations are components of the traditional medicine of theSouthern part of the Country. The plant has been employed as remedy for the treatmentPlants 2025, 14, 1451 4 of 17of cough and bronchitis in the regions of Sardinia [18,19] and Basilicata (both in SouthItaly), where it is referred to with the vernacular name of “erva da bronchite” (herb to treatbronchitis) [19]. In the Castelmazzano village, located in Dolomiti Lucane mountain area,the use of the species is very popular, and the plant is cultivated as a constant in many gar-dens. Here traditionally, the aerial parts are collected during summer, dried and then usedduring fall–winter for the preparation of a complex decoction, including the leaves, seeds,and fruits of other species like mallow (Malva sylvestris L.), chamomile (Matricaria recutitaL.), figs (Ficus carica L.), jujube fruits (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)or oat (Avena sativa L.), mulberry (Morus alba L. and M. nigra L.), laurum (Laurus nobilisL.), orange (Citrus sinensis L.), almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.), and apple (Malus domesticaBorkh.) [20].In Sardinia, the oil of H. hircinum L. is also used to treat skin burns and infections, whilethe hydroalcoholic extract to relieve rheumatic pains, sciatica, sprains, and dislocations aswell as for wound healing [19]. Finally, in Calabria (South Italy), bundles of H. hircinum L.are used as a remedy against migraines [21].

Schematic representation of preparation and uses of H. hircinum according to ethnopharmacological records. 4. Chemical Composition The chemistry of the genus Hypericum has been largely studied, and numerous bioactive compounds like terpenoids, flavonoids, xanthones, naphthodianthrones, and phloroglucinols have been identified [22,23]. Several studies describing the chemical composition of both the essential oils (EO) and the phenolic profile of H. hircinum L. are available. The most-used analytical method for the characterization of the chemical profile of Hypericum is chromatography. Volatile compounds are primarily identified by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, while phenolic compounds are mainly detected and quantified by high-pressure and ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry [22]. 4.1. Essential Oils The Hypericum species are generally classified as plants with less oil concentration because of their low amount of EOs with yields <1%, which in rare cases have been reported to be up to 3% and mainly accumulated in flowers and leaves [2–24]. The major constituents of Hypericum EOs are aliphatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenoids, and Figure 3.

Essential OilsThe Hypericum species are generally classified as plants with less oil concentration be-cause of their low amount of EOs with yields < 1%, which in rare cases have been reportedto be up to 3% and mainly accumulated in flowers and leaves [2–24]. The major constituentsof Hypericum EOs are aliphatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenoids, and monoterpenes [2,24,25].However, the oil composition has been found to be susceptible to environmental, physio-logical, and genetic factors, including seasonal fluctuations [24], phenological cycle [25],and geographic distribution [2].H. hircinum L. EOs from both whole plants and individual organs have been char-acterized, and a list of compounds is reported in Table 1. In general, the EOs obtainedfrom flowering aerial parts are rich in sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, and alkanes [26,27].Plants 2025, 14, 1451 5 of 17More in details, EOs from flowering samples collected in Italy were characterized bycis-β-guajene (27.5%), δ-selinene (11.4%), n-nonane (10.2%), limonene (5.1%), β-pinene(4.3%), α-gurjunene (4.0%), and caryophyllene oxide (3.2%) as well as by the sesquiter-penes β-caryophyllene, α- and β-gurjunene, and caryophyllene oxide; by considerableamounts of 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethyl)-phenol in the β-glucosidase treated aqueous extract;and by the alkanes nonane, undecane, and 3-methylnonane [28] as major compounds,while EOs of plants from Greece and Lebanon have been found to be mainly composed ofhydrogenated sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes (31.9% and 29.3% respectively), followedby oxygenated sesquiterpenes (18.6%) and monoterpene (15%), with (E)-caryophylleneand β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and γ-terpinen being the most representativecompounds [2,26] (Table 1).Regarding EOs isolated from individual plant parts, α- and β-pinene, myrcene, and β-caryophyllene were identified as the main constituents of the leaf EOs in a population ofH. hircinum L. from Turkey [2,29], while in plants collected in Southern Italy, nonane, α- andβ-gurjunene, caryophyllene oxide, and β-caryophyllene showed the highest concentration [28].Fruit EOs were found to be mainly composed of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons andmonoterpenes like nonane, undecane, α- and β-pinene, trans-pinocarveol, myrtenal, andα-terpineol [28].These data appear different from those deriving from the analyses of leaf EOs ofH. hircinum subps. majus (Aiton) N. Robson, investigated during different years, seasons,and phenological stages [30,31]. Here, the main compounds detected were cis-β-guaiene,isolongifolan-7-α-ol, (E)-caryophillene, δ-selinene, trans-Cadina-1(6), and 4-diene, whileα- and β-gurjunene, β-pinene, and limonene were only detected in low or trace amounts.EOs from fruits and flowers of H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson [30]contained, respectively, high amounts of monoterpenes, like limonene and β-pinene, andoxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons, with limonene, δ-selinene,isolongifolan-7-α-ol, β-pinene, limonene, α-terpineol, (E) caryophyllene, caryophylleneoxide, α-terpineol, nonane, and undecane being the most abundant (Table 1).Table 1.

Phenolic CompoundsHypericum species are sources of various bioactive phenolic compounds belongingto the polyketide metabolism and including phloroglucinols, naphtodianthrones, xan-thones, flavonoids, and flavones. The distribution of these metabolites is of interest forthe chemotaxonomy of the genus [1,32,33], and some of these compounds are regarded aschemotaxonomic markers suitable for resolving higher-order relationships within taxon-omy (i.e., family to species) [1].H. hircinum L., like all members of the Androsaemum section, accumulates phloroglu-cinols but not anthraquinones [7,34,35], even if traces of hypericin and pseudohypericinhave been reported by Mandrone et al. and Odabaş et al. [36,37] in flowers of H. hircinumsubsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson. In a previous study by Tocci et al. [38], the phenolic profileof H. hircinum L. subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson was described and compared with otherspecies collected in the same period and in the same geographical area in the northeasternItaly. As reported in Table 2, H. hircinum L. exhibited higher amounts of benzoate andcinnamates compared to H. hirsutum L., H. maculatum Crantz, and H. perforatum L. and thehighest content of flavonols of all the species studied.Table 2.

Pharmacological Properties The genus Hypericum includes a large number of species with documented pharmacological properties, such as antidepressant, antimicrobial, anticancer, and wound healing [45,46]. Several properties have also been documented for H. hircinum L., Figure 4. Chemical structures of major compounds in H. hircinum L. extracts.Plants 2025, 14, 1451 9 of 17H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson is the best characterized subspecies. Theethanolic extract of the aerial parts of plants collected in Portugal were characterized by highamounts of hyperoside and quercitrin [42]. Extracts from plants collected in Central andNorthern Italy confirmed hyperoside as the major compound and also reported consistentconcentrations of chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, quercetin glycosides, isoquercitrin,quercitrin, and catechin and of the phloroglucinol hyperforin [38,43,44]. Plants collected inSicily were characterized by the presence of 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and cinnamic acidsderivatives [34]. Odabaş et al. [37] analyzed the distribution of 17 phenolic compoundsin leaves, stems, and flowers and found that flowers contained higher concentrations ofamentoflavone, quercetin, catechin, and epicatechin in comparison with the other organs,while stem extracts were characterized by the lowest amounts of phenolic compounds.5. Pharmacological PropertiesThe genus Hypericum includes a large number of species with documented phar-macological properties, such as antidepressant, antimicrobial, anticancer, and woundhealing [45,46].

Figure 5. Pharmacological properties of H. hircinum L. extracts and EO. nd: not determined. 5.1. Antibacterial Activity Many species of the genus Hypericum are known for their beneficial effects against infectious diseases like skin inflammation and urinary and gastrointestinal disorders caused by microorganisms. The antibacterial activity of the genus has been extensively studied, and many reports underline its potential as source of valuable antimicrobial leads [47,48]. Despite the fact that essential oils are well known for their antimicrobial properties, the antibacterial properties of those deriving from H. hircinum L. have not been properly investigated so far. In the study of Pistelli et al. [39], the extracts of H. hircinum L., tested through the disc diffusion assay, showed growth inhibitory activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes and against the Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Through the same test, H. hircinum subps. majus (Aiton) N. Robson extracts revealed activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [30]. Interestingly, chloroform extracts from H. hircinum subps. majus (Aiton) N. Robson and H. hircinum subsp. albimontanum (Greuter) N. Robson showed strong growth inhibition of multi-drug-resistant strains of S. aureus [43]. A study of Nogueira et al. [42], performed using the broth microdilution assay, demonstrated noteworthy properties against a panel of clinical drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and confirmed activity against S. aureus. A study of Maggi et al. [30] documented activity of H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson oils against both negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus, S. mutans, and B. subtilis) bacteria; however, no defined minimum inhibitory concentration values are available. 5.2.

[30] documented activity of H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N.Robson oils against both negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus, S. mutans, and B. subtilis)bacteria; however, no defined minimum inhibitory concentration values are available.5.2. Antifungal ActivityFungal infections are considered a major health problem worldwide. The urgency ofthe pharmaceutical industry in searching for novel lead molecules for antifungal therapyhas rekindled interest in plant derived natural products [6]. Here, an increasing number ofpublications highlights the antifungal potential of the genus Hypericum [32,38,49].Representatives of the fungal genus Candida, such as C. albicans, are among the mostprevalent and important causes of severe invasive infections, leading to high mortality andtreatment costs [50]. Extracts and essential oils of H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robsonhave shown activity against pathogenic Candida species [30,43]. Tocci et al. [38] described thestrong anti-Candida properties of the extracts obtained from the infusion of the aerial partsof H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson in hot water, active against both fluconazole-resistant and -sensitive fungal strains, including C. albicans, and emerging pathogens likeC. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis while showing no cytotoxicity to human cells in vitro. Thisstudy provided a scientific basis for the traditional use of teas based on H. hircinum L. to treatcough and bronchitis that are often exacerbated by fungal infections, particularly caused byAspergillus and Candida spp. [51]. It suggested the species as a potential supplier of antifungalremedies and active principles, thus encouraging further investigations.5.3. Antiviral ActivityPlants with antiviral properties have often been the object of investigations aiming toidentify new lead compounds to inhibit virus replication. Despite the availability of morethan 20 drugs currently approved for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virustype-1 (HIV-1), HIV-1 still represents a worldwide health issue [52]. Hypericum spp. havebeen reported to show anti-HIV-1 properties, and this activity has been mainly attributedto the presence of different classes of compounds like hypericin and pseudohypericin [53]or phloroglucinols [54]. Ethanolic extracts obtained from H. hircinum L. were found toefficiently inhibit the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H function, which isfundamental for viral replication in the host [41]. In addition to those of quercetin, 5,7,3′,5′-tetrahydroxyflavone, and 5,7,3′,5′-tetrahydroxyflavone-7-glucoside, the antiviral activity ofthe extract has been mainly attributed to the presence of betulinic acid (Figure 4), this latterknown to inhibit viral replication, blocking viral entry and maturation in the host cells [52].5.4. Effects on the Nervous SystemThe most famous species, H. perforatum L., is well known for its antidepressive ac-tivity and remedies for the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression are available incommerce. Also, other Hypericum species have been shown to exert antidepressant effects,both in vitro and in vivo tests, suggesting that the genus could be an excellent source ofpharmaceuticals for the treatment of neurological disorders [55]. The proposed mechanismof action through which Hypericum extracts exert their beneficial effects is the inhibition ofthe enzymes monoaminoxidase (MAO) responsible for the inactivation of monoaminergicPlants 2025, 14, 1451 11 of 17neurotransmitters. By avoiding the neurotransmitter breakdown, MAO inhibitors help instabilizing the mood [40].Methanolic extracts of H. hircinum L. showed in vitro inhibitory activity of MAO, andthe active principle was identified as the flavonoid quercetin (Figure 1), which was foundto be a selective inhibitor of MAO-A, an isomer responsible for the oxidative deaminationof amines like norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamin [40]. However, this effect wasnot observed in the in vivo Porsolt’s FST model of depressive states in rats using dosesof quercetin ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg. On the contrary, the open field test, an in vivomodel used for measuring levels of anxiety, demonstrated an anxiogenic effect of theH. hircinum L. extract on mice, both at low and high concentrations [56].5.5. Antioxidant PropertiesOxidative stress occurs when the detoxifying mechanisms of cells are not able to neu-tralize excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals that can cause importantdamage to cell metabolism. Oxidative stress in humans is involved in cell aging and in thedevelopment of serious vascular and neurological pathological states, like Alzheimer’s andParkinson’s diseases, as well as to cancer. Antioxidants are playing a fundamental role tocounteract detrimental effects of ROS, and phenolic compounds extracted from plants areimportant antioxidants. For instance, their assumption with the diet is considered essentialfor the prevention of the risk of strokes [57,58] and cancer [59]. Moreover, antioxidants areimportant supplements in the food industry for food preservation [60].The antioxidant activity of extracts and fractions from H. hircinum L. were investigatedin vitro using the ABTS, the DPPH, the FRAP-ferrozine (FRAP-FZ), and the β-carotenebleaching test [31,37,61]. This analysis revealed a rather high antioxidant activity of bothethanolic extract and decoction and highlighted the positive contribution of flavonolcomponents, together with derivatives of flavanones and caffeoylquinic acids, to theantioxidant capacity of H. hircinum L. crude extract. The in vitro findings were also observedin vivo by a study by Shah et al. [62] demonstrating the protective antioxidant activity ofH. hircinum L. extracts on cardiotoxicity that was artificially induced in rats by treatmentwith the antitumoral drug doxorubicin.On the other hand, the antioxidant activity of H. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N.Robson was further evaluated using the Rancimat and the DPPH radical scavengingmethods, revealing only a moderate effect [44], highlighting the necessity for further in-depth investigations to better define the actual components, the extraction process, and theplant metabolism influencing the antioxidant properties.5.6. Inhibitory Activity on Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs)Matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs) are a family of endoproteinases involved in thedegradation of components of the extracellular matrix. MMPs are responsible for the degra-dation of cartilage associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [63]; of newlyformed extracellular matrix resulting in non-healing wounds [64,65]; and of elastin fibersin alveoli, playing an important role in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease [66]. The ethnopharmacological uses of H. hircinum L. as a remedy for rheumaticpains, wound healing, and bronchitis suggest a possible role as an MMP inhibitor. Extractsfrom H. hircinum L. have been shown to exert inhibitory activity against two members ofthe MMP family, collagenase [61] and α-glucosidase [36].5.6.1. Anti-Collagenase ActivityCollagens are the most abundant proteins in mammals and represent the main struc-tural proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where they play structural roles contribut-ing to tensile strength in skin and to resistance to traction in ligaments [67].Plants 2025, 14, 1451 12 of 17Collagenases degrade collagen in smaller peptides and are involved in the mainte-nance of numerous healthy processes, including morphogenesis, tissue remodeling, andwound healing; in multiple pathologies, including tumor cell spreading (metastasis), arthri-tis, glomerulonephritis, periodontal disease, tissue ulcerations, cardiovascular disease,neurodegenerative diseases; and in skin aging [68]. Therefore, the search for collagenaseinhibitors is of considerable interest both for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications.Due to their well-reported anti-ECM-degrading enzyme activity, Hypericum speciesrepresent a largely unexplored source of bioactive molecules that can be utilized to de-velop cosmetic formulations exhibiting anti-aging properties. Anti-collagenase activity hasbeen reported for several Hypericum species, including H. androsaemum L., H. ascyron L.,H. calycinum L., H. confertum Choisy, H. origanifolium Willd., and H. perforatum L. [61,69–71].The hydroalcoholic total extracts of H. hircinum L. showed in vitro inhibitory effectsthrough a non-competitive mechanism on collagenase activity (IC50 value of 156.0 µg/mL),which were higher in fractions containing quercetin, caffeoylquinic acids, and 5,7,3′,5′-tetrahydroxyflavanone (Figure 1) [61].5.6.2. Anti α-Glucosidase ActivitiesGlucosidases are a class of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bondsin oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, playing an important role in many biologicalprocesses. The research of glycosidase inhibitors finds application in the developmentof new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of numerous diseases such as diabetes,obesity, cancer, viral infections, and genetic disorders. Plants have long traditional usesin the treatment of metabolic disorders, and the genus Hypericum has been reported asan important source of anti-hyperglycemic agents. Amongst others, H. perforatum L.,H. asyncron L., and H. linarioides Bosse have been shown to possess anti-α-glucosidaseactivity. Notably, the availability of glucose and related monosaccharides is decreasedby the inhibition of α-glucosidases, resulting in low sugar levels and reduced absorptionof after-meal glucose. Unfortunately, the currently available α-glucosidases often causeundesirable gastrointestinal side effects. For this reason, the search for alternative inhibitorsof α-glucosidase is of importance in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for thetreatment of metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia, type II non-insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus, and obesity. In a study performed on three different H. hircinum L.extracts (70% ethanol, 50% methanol in phosphate buffer, and decoction), Madrone et al. [36]reported a relevant inhibition activity of α-glucosidase comparable to those of luteolin andacarbose, the most widely prescribed drug, encouraging further studies to evaluate theapplication of H. hircinum L. preparations for the development of food supplements tocombat hyperglycemia.6. Toxicity and Safety AssessmentPlant extracts consist of a complex of biologically active compounds. Therefore,assessing toxicity and herb–drug interaction prior to the proposal of an herb-based productis essential. The toxicity and safety of H. perforatum L., which is already used in commercialproducts, have been extensively studied. The most common cause of Hypericum-relateddrug interaction is the modulation of the Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme, resulting inthe reduction of drug efficacy in therapy [72].Currently, there are no available studies on the herb–drug interactions, safety, andtoxicology of H. hircinum L. in vivo.It has been demonstrated that the administration of H. hircinum L. extracts in micereduces the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, a drug with potent and broad spectrum antitumoractivity against a variety of human solid tumors and hematological malignancies [62].Plants 2025, 14, 1451 13 of 17Some in vitro cytotoxicity data are available. H. hircinum L. extracts showed toxicityat the highest dosages tested (500 µg/mL) on African green monkey kidney cells [36]and lower cytotoxicity than H. perforatum L. on the murine fibroblasts cell line, NIH/3T3(LC50 180 and 101 µg/mL, respectively, in dark condition and 140 and 33 µg/mL in lightexposure) [72]. A low cytotoxicity was also reported to human fibroblasts for H. hircinumsubps. majus (Aiton) N. Robson [38].7. Non-Pharmacological PropertiesAllelopathic ActivityThe extensive use of synthetic herbicides presents a significant threat for human andenvironmental health and has led to the search for biological alternatives for weed control.Plant extracts with allelopathic activity that can influence the germination and growth ofother plants could represent valid alternatives to the use of synthetic herbicides. However,there is limited knowledge regarding the allelopathic potential of the genus Hypericum.In a screening project involving 17 Mediterranean plant species, the aqueous extract ofH. hircinum subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson emerged as a promising candidate for weedbiocontrol. In particular, the extract inhibited seed germination and exerted phytotoxiceffects in pot cultures, suggesting its potential use as an herbicide [73]. In another study,essential oils from H. hircinum L. collected in Southern Italy showed slight inhibitory effectson the germination and radicle elongation in garden cress [27].8. Materials and MethodsPeer-reviewed articles were consulted using the search terms “Hypericum hircinum”,“stinking tutsan”, and “Goat St John’s wort” in databases such as PubMed, ScienceDi-rect, Wiley, Springer, ACS, Scielo, Web of Science, and other web search tools likeGoogle Scholar and Google Search. The research was performed applying severalterms: “Hypericum AND hircinum”, “Hypericum hircinum phytochemistry”, “Hypericum hircinumethnopharmacology”, “Hypericum hircinum composition”, “Hypericum AND ethnopharmacology”,and “Hypericum hircinum activity”. Exclusion criteria were applied for duplicates, and spe-cific evaluation parameters were used to check whether the selected articles fulfilled theestablished criteria. All articles reviewed were published until March 2025 and are inEnglish and Italian language.9. ConclusionsH. hircinum L. is a Mediterranean plant used in the traditional medicine of SouthernItaly to treat bronchitis, rheumatic and muscular pains, wound healing, skin infections,and migraines.Evidence from the literature demonstrates that H. hircinum L. is rich in bioactive metabo-lites like terpenes, alkanes, phloroglucinols, flavonoids, xanthones, and phenolic acids.Although many chemical components have been identified, only a few pure com-pounds have been tested for their biological activity to clarify the pharmacological mecha-nism of action and the metabolites responsible for the activities. In this context, the limiteddistribution of the species could represent a limit for the retrieval of the raw material. Theapplication of biotechnological production processes for the in vitro propagation of thespecies and for the study of secondary metabolism could represent a successful tool.H. hircinum L. has been shown to exert various pharmacological properties, includ-ing antimicrobial properties, antioxidant properties, antidepressant properties, and theinhibition of matrix metallo-proteinases, supporting the traditional uses of the plant.Despite all the encouraging data, most of the studies were only performed in vitro,and in vivo models to provide scientific evidence are still missing. A deeper investigationPlants 2025, 14, 1451 14 of 17of H. hircinum L. to better exploit the potentiality of the plant is needed. The investigationof toxicity and safety assessment especially represents a crucial challenge before delvinginto in vivo studies.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, N.T. and T.W.; writing—original draft preparation, N.T.,M.P., L.C. and T.W.; writing—review and editing, N.T., M.P, L.C., T.W.
