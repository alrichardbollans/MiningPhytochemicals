Sinapis Semen: A review onphytochemistry, pharmacology,toxicity, analytical methods andpharmacokineticsRui Dang†, Huida Guan† and Changhong Wang*The MOE Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicines, Shanghai R&D Centre forStandardization of Chinese Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University ofTraditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, ChinaSinapis Semen (SS), the driedmature seed of Sinapis alba L. and Brassica juncea (L.)Czern. et Coss., is one of the traditional Chinese medicinal materials with a widerange of pharmacological effects being used for asthma, cough and many otherailments. SS is also widely used in food agriculture, medicine and other industriesin North America and South Asia. More recently, the research on SS has graduallyintensified and increased. However, there is no systematic review of SS. In thisreview, through literature exploration and analysis, the research advance onphytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, analytical methods andpharmacokinetics of SS was aggregated initially. Total 144 compounds havebeen isolated and identified from SS. Among them, glucosinolates and theirhydrolysates and volatile oils are the main active ingredients and importantchemical classification markers. SS has a wide range of pharmacologicaleffects, especially in cough suppressing, asthma calming, anti-inflammatory,neuroprotective, cardiovascular protective, inhibiting androgenic effects, anti-tumor, and skin permeation promoting effects. Sinapine and sinapic acid are themain active ingredients of SS for its medicinal effects. However, SS has a strongskin irritation, presumably related to the time of application, the method ofprocessing, and original medicinal plants. This review will provide useful datafor the follow-up research and safe and reasonable clinical application of SS.KEYWORDSSinapis Semen, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, analytical methods,pharmacokineticsOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYGunawan Indrayanto,University of Surabaya, IndonesiaREVIEWED BYCarlos L.

Czern. et Coss., is widely used in China, NorthAmerica and South Asia in food agriculture, medicine and otherindustries (Nicácio et al., 2021). SS has the function of warming thelung and resolving phlegm, promoting qi and removing stasis,dredging collaterals and alleviating pain (Wu et al., 2022). SS hasa long history of medicinal use, functioning as treating cough withcold phlegm, chest distension and pain, phlegm stagnation in themeridians and collaterals, numbness and pain in the joints, phlegm-dampness flow, gangrene and swelling pain. SS was first published asname of “Jie” in the Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians(Sun, 2015). The processing method of SS is mostly stir-frying toyellow (Liang et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2010).SS is often combined with other herbs in clinic for treatment ofbronchial asthma and other respiratory diseases (Liu et al., 2018).The treatment of winter diseases in summer is a characteristictherapeutic strategy of traditional Chinese medicine. It refers to thetreatment method of giving targeted treatment in summer toimprove the body’s ability to resist diseases, thus to reduce oreliminate the diseases that tend to occur or aggravate in winter.The most common treatment method for the winter disease curedin summer is herbal acupuncture point paste. SS is used as a basicmedicine for the winter disease cured in summer due to its skinpenetration enhancing effect (Fang et al., 2010; Ruan et al., 2019).Up to now, more than 140 chemical components of SS have beenidentified. Glucosinolates and their hydrolysates are the maincomponents of SS that exert medicinal effects (Wang et al., 2015).Modern pharmacological studies have shown that SS has anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-tumor andanti-bacterial effects, etc. (Boscaro et al., 2018). The glucosinolates in SSand their degradation products have anti-cough and asthma, liverprotection, antioxidant, anti-cancer and other effects (Zhang et al.,2015). SS has been used for asthma, cough, hypertension,hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, testicular damage, prostateenlargement, fatty liver, tumors, and herniated lumbar disc (Ou,2002; Zhou et al., 2014). Many studies have been focused on thebiological applications of SS. Myrosinase is the only enzyme thatcatalyze the cleavage of the S-glycosidic bond using ascorbate as acofactor and a reaction mechanism that retains the anomericconfiguration at the cleavage. Glucosinolates are hydrolyzed bymyrosinase, and depending on the structure of side chain, thepresence of additional proteins and cofactors generates componentssuch as isothiocyanates and nitriles. The products obtained fromhydrolysis exert a variety of pharmacological effects (Halkier andGershenzon, 2006; Bhat and Vyas, 2019). A small number ofscholars have studied the pharmacokinetics of SS. In addition, SS isstrongly irritative to skin when it is for external use, manifested as localpain, red skin, itching, sting, blisters and infection (Wu et al., 2016). Butthere is no systematic review of the phytochemistry, analytical methods,pharmacology, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of SS. This paper reviewsthe phytochemistry, pharmacological effects, toxicity and in vivometabolic processes of SS from the perspective ofethnopharmacology in published articles in recent decades toprovide assistance in the development of SS safety and further research.2 Ethnopharmacological useWith a long history of medicinal use for more than 2,000 yearsin China, SS is widely used for the treatment of cough and asthmacaused by phlegm retention, fullness and pain in chest andhypochondrium, nausea and vomiting, aphasia from apoplexy,GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583limb paralysis and numbness, barbiers, dorsal furuncle, swelling andpain from bruises (Yu, 2005).SS can be taken orally, and is also for external use. Since ancienttimes, with the application of SS more and more widely, moreprocessing methods and effectiveness have been graduallydiscovered. In Lei Gong Pao Zhi Yao Xing Jie, it was written that,“It can treat parasitic tympanties when being processed withvinegar.” According to Ben Cao Zheng Yao, taking the liquorwith SS, nausea will disappear, and applying SS with vinegar,carbuncle toxin can be treated. In addition to being stir-fried, SScan also be processed with liquor or vinegar.In clinical practice, SS is usually applied with other herbs. Itcan be combined with Raphani Semen to treat cough, and withMyrrha to treat arthralgia. When it is used with Lycopodii herba,bone ache can be relieved, and with Chuanxiong rhizoma,headache can be eased (Liu and Shi, 2017). The classicalformulations containing SS handed down from ancientmedical books or ethnic medical experience are now widelyused in clinic.San Zi Yang Qin Decoction (Duan, 2007) is a traditional famousprescription to relieve cough, prevent asthma, and eliminate phlegm.Ma Xin Gan Shi Decoction is a proved prescription to treat asthma,it is beneficial to diffuse lung qi, tonify spleen, reduce phlegm andfluid retention, and relieve cough and asthma (Zhou et al., 2015). BaiJie Zi Powder, composed of SS, Corydalis Rhizoma, Asari Radix etRhizoma, and Kansui Radix, can be used to treat bronchial asthmaby relieving cough and asthma, enhancing the body resistance andtonifying qi effectively (Liu et al., 2018). Due to the multipleapplications, now SS has been made into paste, patch, decoction,powder, pill and medicinal liquor.3 PhytochemistryAfter years of phytochemical research, 144 compounds have beenisolated and identified from SS. The compounds (1–144) of SS reportedin the literatures were listed in (Supplementary Table S1). SS is rich inglucosinolates and their hydrolysates, which are the main componentswith pharmacological activity. Sinapine (1) and 4-hydroxybenzoylcholine(21) often used as an indicator component for the authentification of SS.Sinigrin (4) and sinalbin (5) are used as quality control components in SS.The extract of SS is soluble in water or alcohol. Glucosinolates and theirFIGURE 1Chemical structures of glucosinolates and their hydrolysates identified from SS (compound 1–23).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583hydrolysates are water-soluble components, and the volatile oil, fattyacids and their methyl esters are fat-soluble components (Buskov et al.,2000). Glucosinolates in SS are easy to be degraded under specificconditions by myrosase (mustard enzymes). The processing methodof frying kills enzymes and protects glycosides (Zhang et al., 2015). Bothsinapine thiocyanate (3) and 4-hydroxybenzyl cyanide (18) increasedafter frying (Liang et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2010). The volatile components(compound 24–86) of SS are mainly isothiocyanates, nitriles, alkanes,olefins, terpenoids, etc. (Cai et al., 2014). Erucic acid (97), methyl erucate(116), linoleic acid (90) andmethyl linoleate (111) are the components offatty acids and fatty acid methyl esters with high content (Zhang andWang, 2006). There are differences in the composition of S. alba and B.juncea, and the response value of sinapine thiocyanate (3) in S. alba ishigher than that of B. juncea. Sinigrin (4) and sinalbin (5) arethioglucosides specific to S. alba and B. juncea, respectively (Huanget al., 2020). Sinalbin (5) and 4-hydroxybenzoylcholine (21) are uniquecomponents of S. alba (Zhang et al., 2010).3.1 Glucosinolates and their hydrolysatesThe basic skeleton of the compounds (1–3) containedacrylate and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol at C-3. Sinapine (1) wasformed by the cleavage of one ethyl trimethylammoniumunder enzymatic, alkaline and high-temperature conditions tosinapic acid (2), and the addition of one thiocyanate ion tosinapine thiocyanate (3). The compounds (4–16) arethioglucose analogs. Glucosinolates are characteristic ofcruciferous seeds, and such components are composed of asugar-containing group, a sulfate group, and a variable non-sugar side chain (R1). Sinalbin (5) is the most abundantthioglucoside component in SS. Sinapine (1), sinapic acid (2),sinapine thiocyanate (3) are hydrolysates of sinalbin (5). Thecompounds (17–21) are degradation products of sinalbin (5). 3-Hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamoylcholine (22) was produced bymethylation, demethylation, and demethoxylation of sinapine(1). 3,4-Methoxybenzoyl choline (23) was generated by themethylation and methoxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoylcholine(21) (Zhang et al., 2015). The main chemical structures ofglucosinolates and their hydrolysates are shown in Figure 1.3.2 Volatile oilsVolatile oils (compound 24–86) (Figures 2–4) are the activeingredient of SS to relieve cough and asthma and expectorant. TheFIGURE 2Partial chemical structures of volatile oils identified from SS (compound 24–42).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583nitriles and isothiocyanates in the volatile oil are derived from thedegradation of glucosinolates by the action of mustard enzymes.Isothiocyanates (compound 82–86) are a naturally occurring class ofcompounds in the cruciferous family that all contain thiocyanogenicgroup. Allyl isothiocyanate (86) accounted for 89% of the totalvolatile oil (Wu et al., 2010).3.3 Fatty acids and their methyl estersMost researchers have used supercritical CO2 extraction andGC-MS to extract and analyze the fatty acids and fatty acid methylesters in SS. The chemical structures of fatty acids (compound87–106) and their methyl esters (compound 107–129) in SS areshown in Figure 5. Fatty acid methyl ester is produced bymethylation of fatty acid, and fatty acid methyl ester is animportant chemical intermediate.3.4 Indole derivativesNine indole derivatives (compound 130–138) contained in SSare currently reported in the literature. Indole derivatives arearomatic heterocyclic compounds whose chemical structures areformed by the juxtaposition of a benzene ring with a pyrrole ring, asshown in Figure 6. At present, the pharmacological effects of indolederivatives in SS have not been reported much.3.5 OthersVitamin B1 (139), vitamin B2 (140), vitamin B3 (141),vitamin C (142), daucosterol (143) and β-sitosterol (144) arethe vitamin and steroidal compounds reported in the literature sofar in SS (Figure 7). The vitamin B family is mainly able tomaintain the normal function of the nervous system and immunesystem, and vitamin C (142) mainly has antioxidant and anti-scorbutic effects. Daucosterol (143) can prevent dry skin andpromote growth and development. β-Sitosterol (144) can lowerserum cholesterol.Comprehensively, glucosinolates and their hydrolysates areparticular components in SS. Depending on structure,glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by myrosinase into differentproducts. Although the intact glucosinolate is not prominentin pharmacological activity, its hydrolysis products exhibitdiverse biological activities. Glucosinolates are of greatimportance for both agriculture and Chinese medicine.Therefore, glucosinolates is a kind of component in SS worthyof future in-depth research, especially in its occurrence andtransformation mechanism.FIGURE 3Partial chemical structures of volatile oils identified from SS (compound 43–66).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.11135834 PharmacologyIn recent decades, the various traditional uses of SS haveattracted extensive attention from scientists and have beenstudied for their wide range of physiological and pharmacologicalproperties. SS extracts or active ingredients have demonstratedvarious pharmacological activities such as anti-asthmatic, anti-cough, liver protection, weight reduction, heart protection, anti-androgenic effects, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-tumor andantioxidant (Table 1), which have great potential for research anddrug development in respiratory diseases, digestive diseases,neurological diseases, cardiovascular system, immune systemdiseases, tumors, and inflammatory diseases (Figure 8).4.1 Effect on the respiratory system4.1.1 Airway allergy reductionEarly studies have shown that asthma has three maincharacteristics of chronic inflammation, airwayhyperresponsiveness and airway remodeling (Chen, 2016).Network pharmacology studies suggest that Peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and transforminggrowth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) are potential targets for the treatmentof bronchial asthma and airway remodeling (Hu et al., 2021). SSacupoint patches can reduce airway hypersensitivity by inhibitingTGF-β and its downstream extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (Erk1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)phosphorylation to reduce matrix metalloproteinase expression andprotect airway epithelial barrier-related proteins (Li, 2017).Meanwhile, SS acupoint patch can improve airway remodeling bydownregulating the airway TGF-β1/Smad 3 protein expression inmice with chronic asthma, thereby treating chronic asthma (Liuet al., 2017). Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) by sinigrinlead an elevation of cAMP level and activating protein kinase A(PKA). PKA mediates a complex processes leading to an impairedability to promote the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC),leading to the relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) (Chu et al.,2020). Sinapine (1) administered orally or as a spray could increasepulmonary and tracheal volumes by dilating airway smooth muscle,FIGURE 4Partial chemical structures of volatile oils identified from SS (compound 67–86).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583thus exerting a calming effect (Wang et al., 2011). Collectively, it canbe seen that SS reduces asthma by reducing airway hypersensitivity,airway remodeling, and dilating airway smooth muscle. Herein thedetailed mechanisms of airway allergy reduction induced by SS weresummed in Figure 9.4.1.2 Cough suppressant inhibition4-Hydroxybenzyl cyanide (18), the decomposition of whichproduces hydrogen cyanide, can inhibit the cough center at lowdoses. Studies have shown that the mechanism is to act as a centralcough suppressant by inhibiting the receptors in the cough reflex arcor the vagus nerve of the afferent cough impulses (Yu, 2005). Thus,SS achieves cough suppression by inhibiting the cough suppressant.4.2 Effect on the digestive system4.2.1 Hepatoprotective activityCurrent studies have shown that SS is effective in nourishing theliver, improving liver fibrosis, and relieving fatty liver. On the onehand, sinapic acid (2) in SS inhibits bromodomain containing 4(BRD4) expression and suppresses oxidative stress, cell scorchingand hepatocyte injury (Chu et al., 2021). On the other hand, SS canprevent methotrexate (MTX)-induced liver injury by inhibitingapoptosis and stimulating Nrf2/HO-1-intermediate antioxidantenzymes through NF-κB inhibition (Ahmad et al., 2021).Sinapine (1) modulate the composition of intestinal flora, inducea decrease in the ratio of thick-walled phylum and mimic phylum,and increase the abundance of probiotic bacteria, thereby inhibitinghepatic steatosis (Li et al., 2019). It has also been shown that SSextract has anti-hepatic fibrosis effect and its potential mechanism ofaction may be related to the modulation of TGF-β1/Smad, NF-κBand AKT signaling pathways and reduction of extracellular matrixdeposition (Cao et al., 2018). The studies indicated that theunderlying mechanisms of the hepatoprotective activity of SSmay be mediated by the regulation of TGF-β1/Smad, NF-κB andAKT signaling pathways.4.2.2 Adipocyte browningBrown-like adipocytes have high caloric metabolism,characterized as high mitochondrial concentrations and highexpression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Numerous studieshave shown that brown adipose tissue not only has the functionof keeping out the cold, but also burns excess fat and sugar togenerate heat and prevent excess fat storage in the body. Sinapic acid(2) enhances the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and UCP1 (Bae and Kim, 2020).Thus, sinapic acid (2) could be used to weight loss by initiatingadipocyte browning through the p38 MAPK/CREB signalingpathway.4.3 Effect on neurodegenerative disorderSinapic acid (2) in SS can increase cell viability and protect cellsfrom 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic cell death. It significantly blocksFIGURE 5Chemical structures of fatty acids and their methyl esters identified from SS (compound 87–129).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583oxidative stress, including excessive production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) and decrease in the expression level of antioxidantproteins, and it also reduces mitochondrial dysfunction andendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and observably inhibitsmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein activation(Zare et al., 2015; Tungalag and Yang, 2021), thereby preventingneurodegenerative diseases. Sinapic acid (2) also promotes CREBmRNA transcription in cells, activates the cAMP/PKA/CREBsignaling pathway, improves Aβ1-42-induced PC12 cellmorphology, and reduces Aβ42 content in cells (Xue et al., 2021;Xue et al., 2022). The potential therapeutic effect of sinapic acid (2) isdue to its attenuation of KA-induced neuronal damage in the brainvia its anti-convulsive activity through gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) (A) receptor activation and radical scavenging activity(Kim et al., 2010). Thus SS can be used as apotential agent toprevent neurodegenerative diseases and reduce nerve damage byimproving cell damage and increasing cell viability.4.4 Effect on the cardiovascular system4.4.1 Anti-hypertensionSS not only protects vascular endothelial function in SHRs byinhibiting nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-richrepeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammatoryvesicle activation and expression of associated inflammatorymediators, but also ameliorates AngII-induced vascularendothelial injury (Liu et al., 2020). Elevated blood pressure isaccompanied by alterations in vascular endothelial cellmorphology and function. Sinapine thiocyanate (3) in SS has asignificant effect in improving blood vessel lining damage andlowering blood pressure.4.4.2 Cardioprotective activityOxygen radical reactions and lipid peroxidation reactions playan important role in the metabolic processes of the body,maintaining many physiological and biochemical reactions andimmune responses in the body. Both increased reactive oxygenspecies production and calcium overload alone can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury. The literature suggests that SS hascardioprotective effects. Sinapic acid (2) reduces lipidperoxidation and calcium ions and enhances the antioxidantsystem and mitochondrial enzymes in rat heart mitochondria(Stanely Mainzen Prince et al., 2020), thereby acting as acardioprotective function.4.5 Effect on the immune systemSS extract inhibits the protein and mRNA levels of TNF-ɑ andIL-6, thus playing an anti-inflammatory role (Xian et al., 2018).Sinapic acid (2) has strong anti-inflammatory activity, which isFIGURE 6Chemical structures of indole derivatives identified from SS (compound 130–138).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583accomplished by blocking caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretionthrough inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bonemarrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) (Lee et al., 2021). It canremarkably ameliorate the occurrence of Caco-2 intercellularhyperpermeability caused by LPS by increasing the mRNAexpression levels of ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-1 and decreasingthe mRNA expression levels of TLR4, NF-kB, MLCK, IL-8, IL-1β(Zhang et al., 2019). Inflammation has been correlated with manychronic diseases, which provides a research basis for SS to treatmany chronic diseases.4.6 Effect on the reproductive system4.6.1 Anti-testicular damage activitySinapic acid (2) is the main component of SS to protect thetesticles. Studies have shown that sinapic acid (2) markedly reducestesticle damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death, andrestores reduced antioxidant enzyme activity, which has aprotective effect on the testicle and improves ischemia-reperfusion injury in the testicle (Unsal et al., 2021).4.6.2 Anti-prostatic hyperplasia activityProstatic hyperplasia is an androgen-dependent disease, andsinapine (1) significantly decreases the wet weight of the prostate,seminal vesicle and murine prepuce glands in mice, reduces serumacid phosphatase activity, and acts as an anti-androgen activity (Wuet al., 2003a). On this basis, a study showed that β-sitosterol (144),sinalbin (5), unsaturated fatty acids and other agents in SS actsynergistically to achieve a variety of effects such as reducingcapillary permeability, inhibiting fibrous tissue proliferation,reducing serum acid phosphatase activity, inhibiting 5α-reductaseactivity, and anti-androgen (Wu et al., 2003b), which havetherapeutic and preventive effects on prostate hyperplasia.4.7 Anti-tumor activityStudies have shown that SS has clear anti-tumor effect. First of all,sinapic acid (2) has strong anticancer activity against variousdifferentiated types of liver cancer cells, and in combination withcisplatin mediates the Bcl-2 assaciated X protein/B cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bax/Bcl-2) signaling pathway, upregulates LC3 proteinexpression, and induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell death (Zhao,2021). And then, sinapine (1) restrains the proliferation ofhepatocellular carcinoma H22 cells by inhibiting the anti-apoptoticfactor Bcl-2 and promoting the expression of the pro-apoptotic factorBax (Nan, 2010). It also induces cell death by increasing intracellularferrous iron, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) innon-small cell lung cancer cells (Shao et al., 2022). Sinapine (1)inhibits tumor growth by suppressing the FGFR4-FRS2α-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, downregulates P-glycoprotein expression(Guo et al., 2014), antagonizes the mutagenic effect ofcyclophthalamide on mouse bone marrow cells, downregulates theexpression of the apoptosis suppressor gene Bcl-2 in tumor cells, andfacilitates apoptosis in mouse sarcoma S180 cells (Ke, 2008). Finally,sinapine thiocyanate (3) from SS significantly decreases the proteinexpression of PTGS1, PTGS2, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 andincreases the protein expression of Bax to prohibit theproliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinomaFIGURE 7Chemical structures of vitamin and steroidal compounds identified from SS (compound 139–144).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583TABLE 1 Pharmacological effects of SS.System Effect Mechanism Extracts orcompoundsModels Invitro/vivoTreatment ReferencesRespiratory Airway allergyreductionReduce TGF-β expression, MAPKphosphorylation, MMP9 andMMP2 protease activitySS patch Guinea pig asthmamodelIn vivo 0.0625–0.5 mg ml−1 Li (2017)Downregulation of TGF-β1/Smad3 pathwaySS patch BALB/c Chronicasthma micemodelIn vivo 0.5 g Liu et al.

In addition, sinapinethiocyanate (3) inhibits the malignant biological behavior of skinsquamous carcinoma A431 and Colo-16 cells through the AKT/β-catenin pathway (Su et al., 2021). Thus, SS achieves antitumor activityby promoting the expression of apoptotic factors and inhibiting theexpression of growth factors in tumor cells. The specificmechanism ofantitumor activity of SS is shown in Figure 10.4.8 Others4.8.1 Hypoglycemic effectSinapine thiocyanate (3) dose-dependently decreases the levelsof lipids, blood glucose, TNF-α and other metabolism-relatedindicators, delays hepatocyte steatosis and atherosclerosis (Huanget al., 2018). Sinalbin (5) achieves hypoglycemic effects by inhibitingα-glucosidase and α-amylase (Abbas et al., 2017).4.8.2 Protective effect against renal injuryStudies have shown that sinapic acid (2) treatment provides adose-dependent and significant kidney protection against cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity in rats (Singh et al., 2020) by up-regulatingPPAR-γ expression.4.8.3 Anti-oxidative activitySS extract, sinapic acid (2) and sinapine thiocyanate (3) havebeen reported to have antioxidant activity (Dubie et al., 2013).Sinapine thiocyanate (3) functions as an antioxidant byscavenging superoxide anion radicals (Li et al., 2012). Sinapicacid (2), as one of phenols, has antioxidant effects by scavenging(DPPH) radicals, scavenging hydrogen peroxide radicals,scavenging NO radicals, and inhibiting microsomal lipidperoxidation activity (Cos et al., 2002; Chen, 2016).Unfortunately, the antioxidant effect of other components of SShas not been seen.TABLE 1 (Continued) Pharmacological effects of SS.System Effect Mechanism Extracts orcompoundsModels Invitro/vivoTreatment ReferencesAnti-prostatichyperplasia activityReduce foreskin gland wet weightand serum acid phosphataseactivitySinapine, β-sitosterol andsinalbinProstatehyperplasia modelIn vivo 8, 16 mg kg−1 Wu et al.(2003a); Wuet al.

SSplays a useful role in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation,cervical spondylosis, scapulohumeral periarthritis, joint synovitis,osteoarthritis and various kinds of bi syndrome, but its mechanismof action has been poorly reported and needs further study (Zhouet al., 2014).4.8.5 Effect on wound healingSinapic acid (2) has been shown to promote the healing ofchronic diabetes wounds and is used in wound dressing hydrogelsFIGURE 8Pharmacological effects of Sinapine (1), sinapic acid (2) and sinapine thiocyanate (3).FIGURE 9Signaling pathways of reducing airway sensitivity of SS.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583with multifunctional properties. In addition, sinigrin (4) hastherapeutic potential for wound healing activity (Mazumderet al., 2016; Liu et al., 2021; Chandika et al., 2022).To conclude, although many of the pharmacological effects of SSand its ingredients have been confirmed, but the pharmacologicaleffects are mainly focused on sinapine (1), sinapic acid (2) andsinapine thiocyanate (3). The models used in the literature are allinternationally accepted models that have been summarized anddisplayed in Table 1. Unfortunately, the scope of pharmacologicalaction and the depth of mechanism of action need to be furtherexpanded. Cough relieving and asthma calming is the mainpharmacological action of SS. The components and targets ofaction can be studied more carefully from the perspective ofsingle compounds. In addition, it is important to emphasize thatstudies on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of othercompounds need to be strengthened. To date, large amount ofresearch of SS have been focused on pharmacological activity inanimal or in vitro cellular models, and few clinical trials have beenconducted, which limits its application. Therefore, formal clinicaltrials should be encouraged to provide more solid evidence forapplication of SS.5 ToxicityThe toxicity of SS is mainly characterized by skin irritation. SS isfrequently used as the primary or formula application foracupuncture point compresses due to its stimulating effect on theskin. Some studies have shown that blistering of the skin occurs inalmost 2 h during the application of SS in vitro and that the dose ispositively correlated with the size of the blister (Wu et al., 2016).Interestingly, some studies have shown a significant associationbetween the reactive symptoms of SS compresses and thetherapeutic effect to be effective in patients with asthma (Ji,2006). On the contrary, it has also been shown that there is nodirect correlation between skin reactivity and efficacy and that drug-acupuncture point interrelationships have to be considered (Cuiet al., 2014), the mechanism of which is unclear and needs to beinvestigated. Another study illustrated that the ratio of raw andcooked SS should be appropriate for topical application bycomparing EOS, IgE, and IgM, and the optimal ratio of raw andcooked SS is 1:2, which has good efficacy and less adverse skinreactions (Lai et al., 2019). There is also literature comparing theskin irritation of SS from different speices, and it was found thatyellow mustard seeds: white mustard seeds (5:5) for triphala pastehad moderate skin irritation (Lu et al., 2020). Reducing the skinirritation of SS is promising for research development.The skin irritation properties of SS also make it commonly usedclinically as a transdermal absorption enhancer for Chinese herbalpatches. The three pathways of drug transmission through the skinare intercellular transmission, intracellular transmission, andappendage transmission (Herman and Herman, 2015). Thevolatile oils of SS mainly composed of allyl isothiocyanate (86)and cyclohexyl isothiocyanate (84) can inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity,increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration, alter the membranepotential of Ha CaT cells, and promote drug entry into the skin(Ruan et al., 2019). Topical application of SS extract also inducedmorphological changes in langerhans cells in the skin and stimulatedthe secretion of IL1β and TNFα in the skin, suggesting activation ofthe immune response (Guo et al., 2013).In short, volatile oils are believed the main component thatcauses skin irritation. The factors leading to skin irritation may berelated to the time of patching, the method of concoction, and theoriginal plant. The mechanism of skin irritation and the correlationbetween skin reaction and drug efficacy deserve further study.Reducing skin irritation is of great importance in the clinicalapplication of SS. However, it is worth noting that the aboveevaluation methods for the severity of skin irritation aresubjective. Therefore, it is particularly important to establish amore objective and recognized evaluation method for skin irritation.FIGURE 10Signaling pathways of anti-tumor effect of SS.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583TABLE 2 Analytical method of SS.Classification AnalyticalmethodConstituents Confirmation ofpeak identityMethods validationparametersReferencesCompositional analysisof medicinal materialsIGC-MS 44 Components in the volatile oil of SS Not confirmed / Liu et al.

The volatile oils and fatty acid compounds from SS havebeen characterized using GC-MS. The extract method of steamdistillation was used to extract volatile oil from SS. The volatileoils of SS were analyzed by GC-MS and were qualitative by NISTdatabase (Liu et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010). The fatty acidcomponents of SS were extracted by petroleum ether and themethyl ester reagents were added for methylation. Then theliquid-liquid extractions were applied to extract theingredients for analysis by GC-MS (Shi et al., 2003; Zhang andWang, 2006; Li and Lin, 2012). The method of headspace solidphase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) was used to extract volatilecomponents from SS. The volatile components were analyzed andidentified by GC-MS (Cai et al., 2014). Confirmation of thevolatile chemical structures of SS should be achievedunambiguously using authentic standards or publications(measured under identical conditions), if no authenticstandards are available (Indrayanto, 2022). However, theextraction methods and GC-MS analysis conditions mentionedabove were different. The MS data were also only searched by theNIST database and the results are difficult to be repeated bysubsequent researchers.Zhang et al. (2021) established a method for contentdetermination of sinapine thiocyanate (3) by HPLC-UV. Themethodological validation included linearity, precision,repeatability, stability and recovery were conformed with ChinesePharmacopoeia (CP). The similarity of 13 batches of SS fingerprintwas more than 0.943. Similarly, He et al. (2020) established theUPLC-UV fingerprints of SS and its formulation granule. Thesimilarities of 15 batches of standard decoction or formulationgranule were greater than 0.99. The available authentic standardsinapine thiocyanate (3) was used as the reference peak to calculatethe relative retention time of other common peaks in the abovefingerprint methods. It was very crucial for quality assessment ofusing chemical profiling.UPLC-Q-Exactive Obitrap MS was adopted to analyzechemical constituents of SS before and after stir-frying. Thechemical constituents of SS before and after stir-frying wereidentified by Compound Discover 3.2 software combined withm/z Cloud database, high resolution MS OTCML database orcompared with the available authentic standards (Jia et al., 2021).The chemometric analysis was not methodologically validatedand the stability of the QC samples was not evaluated (ORALaboratory Manual, 2022). The chemometrics method only wasperformed for the content changes of chemical constituents usingpeak area as variate (Jia et al., 2021). Popova et al. established asimple and fast ion chromatography (IC) method for thesimultaneous quantification of sinigrin (4), sinalbin (5), andanionic hydrolysis products of SS. The related compoundswere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,United States) or isolated in their laboratory. Calibrationcurve, limits of detection (LOD), and limits of quantification(LOQ) for two intact glucosinolates (sinigrin and sinalbin) andanionic hydrolysis products (SO42− and SCN−) were determinedby the proposed IC method (Popova and Morra, 2014). Nicácioet al. (2021) optimized the QuEChERS extraction methodfollowed by UHPLC-MS/MS analysis for phenolic compoundsdetermination in three species of SS. 21 phenolic compoundswere estimated, and the linearity, LOD and LOQ weredetermined. The intra-day, and inter-day precisions werecarried out and expressed in terms of relative standarddeviation (RSD). Rochfort et al. (2008) established a methodof ion trap mass spectrometry for glucosinolates. This methodtakes advantage of the glucosinolate anion fragmentation whichconsistently produces a sulphonate ring-opened glucose moiety(m/z 259) in the ion trap mass spectrometer. The strategy couldbe applied to determine glucosinolates in SS.Determination of the chemical structure of the unknowncompounds could be performed by using completespectroscopic analysis (UV-VIS, IR, CD, HR-MS and NMR).SS was extracted and partitioned and the ten chemicalconstituents were purified by chromatography andrecrystallization and then the structures were determined bynuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HMQC andHMBC) (Feng et al., 2008).In a number of quantitative cases, authors only selectedvalidation parameters (LOD, LOQ, linearity, recovery,precision, stability and matrix effect, etc.) which were underclose interest and not all parameters were investigated. Inaddition, some validation parameters also did not conform tothe published guidelines (Kruve et al., 2015). The confirmation ofpeak identity and quantitative methods validation parameterswere described in detail in Table 2.6.2 Biological sample analysisThe metabolism of sinapic acid (2) in rats has been studied byresearchers as early as 1969 using paper chromatography(Griffiths, 1969), and a metabolic pathway of sinapic acid (2)was proposed. Due to the limitations of the technique, themetabolites of sinapic acid (2) were compared with referencematerials prepared in laboratory only by the maximumultraviolet absorption and Rf values. Because of thecomplexity of metabolites in vivo, it was easy to cause falsepositive results. In recent years, the pharmacokinetics ofsinapic acid (2) from SS in rat plasma has been investigatedby a validated UPLC-MS/MS method (Li et al., 2020). Thedynamic distribution of sinapine thiocyanate (3) has beenmonitored using a validated UPLC-MS/MS method (Tanget al., 2022). The quantitative method validation wasestablished according to the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) guidelines (US Food and DrugAdministration, 2018). The items of validation includedselectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect,extraction recovery, and stability. In addition, the metabolicpathways of sinapine thiocyanate (3) have also been studiedusing UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS in rat plasma, urine and fecalsamples after oral administration of sinapine thiocyanate (3)(Guan et al., 2022). Thirteen metabolites were structurallyidentified, and the proposed metabolic pathways of sinapineFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583thiocyanate (3) included deamination, demethylation,hydrogenation, dehydration, and extensive conjugation.Methods validation parameters of biological samples were alsosummarized in Table 2. The assay of mass spectrometry,especially combined mass spectrometry, will be a powerfulanalytical tool for determination of trace metabolites in vivoin the pharmacokinetic and metabolic study of SS.7 PharmacokineticsIn the last decades, the active ingredients in SS have beenanalyzed in vivo and in vitro to study their biotransformationprofiles. These studies focused on glucosinolates and theirmetabolites, such as sinalbin (5), sinapic acid (2), sinapinethiocyanate (3), and thioglucoside analogues. Glucosinolatesare hydrolyzed by the mustardase to produce p-hydroxybenzylisothiocynate (white mustard oil), sinapine bisulfate (acidicmustard base) and glucose. Sinapine bisulfate is hydrolyzed byalkaline hydrolysis to produce sinapic acid (2) and choline. Thep-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate is extremely unstable in alkalinesolution and decomposes into the p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol andthiocyanate (Wan, 2014). In addition, administration of sinapicacid (2) to rats results in urinary excretion of 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenylpropionic acid, dihydro sinapic acid (2), 3-hydroxy-5-methoxycinnamic acid, and unchanged sinapic acid(2). The sinapine (1) is also catabolized to free sinapic acid (2)and 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenylpropionic acid in rats. 3,4,5-Trimethoxycinnamic acid is partially metabolized to sinapicacid (2) and 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenylpropionic acid. Andthen 3,5-dimethoxycinnamic acid is metabolized to 3-hydroxy-5-methoxycinnamic acid and 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenylpropionic acid (Griffiths, 1969). Two proteins(CFPTT and CfPbgS) have also been shown to be the enzymesresponsible for the degradation of sinalbin (5). Sinalbin (5) isabsorbed and phosphorylated by CfPttS and subsequently, thephosphorylated entity is degraded by CfPbgS (Watanabe et al.,2021). Metabonomics studies have shown that the extensivemetabolism of sinapine thiocyanate (3) includes deamination,demethylation, reduction, dehydration, glucuronideincorporation and sulfate incorporation to produce11 metabolites (Guan et al., 2022).Previous pharmacokinetics focused on sinapine thiocyanate(3), sinapic acid (2), and sinapine chloride. The pharmacokineticparameters of sinapine thiocyanate (3) after intravenous(2 mg/kg) and intragastric (100 mg/kg) administrations wereobtained. The parameter values of Tmax and Cmax were88.74 ± 20.08 min and 47.82 ± 18.77 nM, respectively. The T1/2 of 67.52 ± 15.69 min in the oral administration group was lowerthan it in the intravenous administration group (Guan et al.,2022). There are studies in the literature showing that the areaunder the drug-time curve (AUC0-t), mean retention time(MRT0-t), of different dose groups of sinapic acid (2) AUC0-tin vivo showed a good linear dependence between 4.5, 9 and18 g/kg, and the pharmacokinetic curve of sinapic acid (2)showed a double peak with a low front and a high back (Liet al., 2020). The cumulative absorption and metabolism rates ofsinapine chloride in the intestinal sac at 90 min reached (5.78 ±1.39)% and (9.42 ± 1.97)%. Sinapine chloride is rapidly absorbedafter gavage administration, reaching peak blood concentrationsat about 2 h; however, it is also rapidly metabolized in the serum,reaching its half-life at about 3 h (Wang et al., 2020).From the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of sinapinethiocyanate (3), sinapic acid (2), and sinapine chloride, it can beconcluded that the bioavailability of SS is low due toenterohepatic circulation. The study of the in vivo absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion process of otheringredients in SS is also significant and deserve further study.It is extremely important to study its percutaneous process andpharmacokinetics for external use in order to provide support forthe mechanism study of topical treatment of SS in various skindiseases or systemic disease, and the safety evaluation of skinirritants.8 Conclusion and perspectivesTaken together, due to its extensive ethnomedicine uses reportedfor thousands of years, SS has become one of the most importantcomponents of many traditional Chinese medicine and ethnicprescriptions. Clinical applications of synergistic compoundingmethods have shown that SS has therapeutic effects on asthma,bronchitis, tendon pain, prostate enlargement, hyperlipidemia,hyperglycemia, hypertension, tumors, and cancer. SS has beenmade into paste, patch, decoction, powder, pill, and medicinalliquor. According to the current literatures, glucosinolates arehydrolyzed by enzymes to produce sinapine (1), sinapic acid (2),sinapine thiocyanate (3), and isothiocyanates. They have significantanti-cough and asthma, anti-inflammatory, anti-nerve damage, anti-androgenic effects, cardioprotective, anti-tumor effects and pro-skinpenetration. SS is mostly used topically with other drugs, but clinicalpractice has shown that they have severe skin irritation and can causeallergic contact dermatitis. It has been documented that SS producesits effects through this skin irritation. Although significantbreakthroughs have been made in the comprehensive explorationand application of SS, there is still some in-depth work to be done inthe future.Firstly, glucosinolates are important components in SS. Dueto the high hydrophilicity and structural similarity, itspurification, isolation and analytical methods need furtherstudy. Meanwhile, the hydrolysis process of glucosinolates canalso be a future research direction. Secondly, although SS hasmany pharmacological activities, they are mainly focused onsinapine (1), sinapic acid (2), sinapine thiocyanate (3). Thepharmacological effects of other components can be furtherstudied, and the molecular targets of many pharmacologicaleffects are not yet clear. Thirdly, reducing the skin irritationof SS is essential for its clinical application. There are fewerstudies on the relationship between irritation, efficacy andchemical composition. Further studies especially those focusedFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org16Dang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1113583on the appropriate dose, efficacy, and safety of SS and itsmetabolites are recommended before subjecting SS to clinicaltrials. Finally, the absorption and metabolism studies of SS havefocused on sinapine thiocyanate (3) and sinalbin (5) after oraladministration, but pharmacokinetic studies of the componentsin SS after topical administration are limited. Therefore,elucidating the pharmacokinetic properties of the activecomponents of SS after topical administration may be avaluable research direction.Author contributionsRD and HG: information collection, conceptualization, writing.CW: conceptualization, writing—review and editing, projectadministration.FundingThis work was financially supported by the National NaturalScience Foundation of China (Grant No. 82003927).Conflict of interestThe authors declare that the research was conducted in theabsence of any commercial or financial relationships that could beconstrued as a potential conflict of interest.Publisher’s noteAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authorsand do not necessarily represent those of their affiliatedorganizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and thereviewers.
