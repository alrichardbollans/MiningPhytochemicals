Its properties as an anti-parasitic, antimicrobial, insecticidal, antitumor,and anticancer agent indicates that it could have further therapeutic potential in treating infections and cancers. Theaim of this review was to provide a comprehensive summary of the traditional uses, phytochemistry andpharmacological properties of P. aduncum. Data were collected from electronic databases from 1978 to 2019. Theplant is traditionally used for treating diarrhoea in Peru and for its wound-healing properties in Brazil and Papua NewGuinea. Phenolics, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and chromene have been found in the P. aduncum plant, and thesebioactive compounds contribute to its anti-parasitic, antimicrobial, insecticidal, antitumor, and anticancer properties.Several pharmacological activities of P. aduncum have been reported, most notably in the treatment of infectiousdiseases and cancer. However, information regarding its safety and efficacy in humans is lacking. Further study isneeded to examine the benefits of P. aduncum and its potential applications in a clinical setting. © 2020 PenerbitUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.
