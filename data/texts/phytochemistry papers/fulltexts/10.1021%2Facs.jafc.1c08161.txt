In this paper, westudied water extracts from the bark of 15 willow hybrids and species as potential antimicrobial additives. Treatment of ground barkin water under mild conditions extracted 12−25% of the dry material. Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography isproven here as a fast and highly efficient tool in the small-scale recovery of raffinose from Salix bark crude extracts for structuralelucidation. Less than half of the dissolved material was assigned by chromatographic (gas chromatography and liquidchromatography) and spectroscopic (mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) techniques for low-molecular-weight compounds, including mono- and oligosaccharides (sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose) and aromaticphytochemicals (triandrin, catechin, salicin, and picein). The composition of the extracts varied greatly depending on the hybridor species and the harvesting season. This information generated new scientific knowledge on the variation in the content andcomposition of the extracts between Salix hybrids and harvesting season depending on the desired molecule. The extracts showedhigh antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.6−0.8 mg/mL; however, noinhibition was observed against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella typhimurium. MIC of triandrin (i.e., 1.25 mg/mL) is reported for the first time. Although antibacterial triandrin and (+)-catechin were present in extracts, clear correlationbetween the antibacterial effect and the chemical composition was not established, which indicates that antibacterial activity of theextracts mainly originates from some not yet elucidated substances. Aquatic toxicity and mutagenicity assessments showed the safeusage of Salix water extracts as possible antibacterial additives.KEYWORDS: antimicrobial activity, mutagenicity, raffinose, toxicity, triandrin, water extract, willow bark■ INTRODUCTIONWhile the viral disease COVID-19 is sweeping the world, itslethality appears to be associated with the secondary bacterialsequelae, such as the ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia,as the lung has no defensive barrier against this bacterium.1Such defenseless state is partially caused by the antimicrobialresistance (AMR) of the bacteria, developed, for example, bythe antibiotics used in indoor poultry farming to promotegrowth and reduce chicken mortality. Although the mechanismof growth promotion in food animals is not fully established,antimicrobial agents are presumed to maintain intestinal healthby regulating bacterial populations of the microbiome. Use oftraditional antibiotics causes the resistance of pathogenicbacteria, which subsequently pose a health threat to humanfor example, Campylobacter and Salmonella pathogens, bothresistant to quinolones, can infect animals and humans.2In 2006, EU banned the use of antibiotics as growthpromoters in animal feed.3 Currently, only antimicrobial feedadditives (e.g., ionophore coccidiostats) are allowed for theirantimicrobial and antiparasitic properties. European AMRSurveillance Network (EARS-Net) reported that AMRinfections have been responsible for 33 000 annual deaths by2015.4 Nevertheless, the global need of the antimicrobials infood animals is predicted to rise by 67% from 63 151 tons(year 2010) to 105 596 tons (year 2030).5 Therefore, there hasbeen a great interest in developing novel antibiotic alternativesto hinder the further growth of the AMR in animals andhumans.In the years 1981−2019, the naturally or mimic-basednaturally occurring metabolites represented almost half of thenewly registered drugs by FDA (U.S. Food and DrugAdministration), thus their share being almost 2 times higherthan that of the synthetic drugs (24.6%).6 Natural metaboliteshave similar beneficial effects as traditional antibiotics.2 Thedietary willow (Salix alba) bark extract in the poultry feed hasreduced significantly proliferation of pathogenic bacteria (i.e.,Enterobacteriaceae) under heat stress and also stimulatedgrowth of the favorable bacteria, such as lactobacilli, in thegut of broilers.7 Furthermore, the supply chain of other natureantimicrobials (e.g., essential oils, functional peptides, nisin,lysozymes, and so forth) may not as sustainable as willow treebecause the renewable willow can be sustainably grown onabandoned peatland,7 which can help in soil carbonReceived: December 21, 2021Revised: February 9, 2022Accepted: February 10, 2022Published: February 24, 2022Articlepubs.acs.org/JAFC© 2022 The Authors.

Salicin has tradition-ally been made of willow bark, inhibiting the growth of bothHelicobacter pylori by suppressing the mutagenic effect ofmetronidazole8 and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria.9Picein, the major metabolite in the willow bark waterextracts,10 has a significant role in the defensing mechanismagainst spruce budworm.11 Triandrin is a stress regulator forthe plant’s adaptogenic activity.12 Catechin is also a stressregulator that potentiates the antimicrobial activity ofgentamicin against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa).13 Raffinose is a natural trisaccharide containinggalactose, glucose, and fructose, which are prebiotic agents thatpromote the growth of lactobacilli.14Although many studies on willow extractives have beenpublished, a systematic approach for upgrading and utilizingthese novel metabolites is still lacking, especially for the highlyproductive energy willow. It is hypothesized that pureextractive compounds can be produced in high yields throughselection of the species or hybrid and harvesting season. Theoverall objective of this study was to evaluate the potential useof willow bark water extracts as antibiotic alternatives. Weaimed to gain the knowledge on the variations in the waterextract content, phytochemical composition, and theirantibacterial activities. Furthermore, an in vivo toxicologicaland mutagenic evaluation of crude extracts was performed toassess their safe usages for animals and environment.■ MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials and Chemicals. Fifteen willow hybrids (Tables S1 andS2) were harvested and supplied from Carbons Finland Oy, VTTTechnical Research Center of Finland Ltd., and Lantma ̈nnenLantbruk. The bark was manually peeled and cut into 2 cm piecesand stored at −20 °C for further use. The barks were ground into 1mm particle size and dried at 40 °C in an oven. Acetone, arabinose,N,O-bistrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), (+)-catechin, DMSO-d6, fruc-tose, galactose, glucose, heneicosylic acid (C21 acid), mannose,picein, pyridine-d5, raffinose, rhamnose, salicin, trimethylsilyl chloride(TMCS), xylitol, and xylose were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich,Finland. Betulinol (99.5% purity) was supplied by Åbo AkademiUniversity. Triandrin was purified by chromatography (Figure S1)based on its size and hydrophobicity differences among all bioactivemolecules from willow hybrid Karin bark extract.15 The purity (ca.90%) of triandrin was assessed from its nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectra (Figures S2−S4).16 The exact match between thewillow hybrid and their associated experiment is summarized in TableS1.Methods. Water Extraction. Water extraction was conducted in asilicon oil-bath-heated iron container by varying temperature (50−100 °C) and time (10−120 min) and using powdered willow bark at aliquid-to-solid ratio of 10:1. The water-soluble fraction was filteredusing qualitative filter paper (particle retention 12−15 μm),centrifuged (8000 rpm) to remove any finer particles, and lyophilized.The solid water extract was stored covered with aluminum foil forfurther chemical analyses. Another set of 15 Salix hybrids (Tables S1and S2) was extracted with water at 80 °C for 20 min. The extractswere purified from solid particles and lyophilized in the same manneras willow hybrid Klara.Preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography for theRecovery of Raffinose. Preparative chromatography (Figure S5) wasperformed using Shimadzu preparative LC consisting of two LC-20APpumps, degasser, SIL-10AP autosampler, SPD-M20A diode arraydetector, and FRC-10A fraction collector. The semipreparative LunaOmega 5 μm PS C18 100 Å (250 × 10 mm) column and Kinetex 5μm Biphenyl 100 Å (250 × 10 mm) were used as a coupled columnsystem for the separation. The bark extract of willow hybrid Tora wasdissolved in water−acetonitrile mixture (92:8) using a concentrationof 5 mg/mL. Ultrapure water−acetonitrile mixture (9:1) was used asan eluent with a flow rate of 3 mL/min. A desired fraction of interest(raffinose) was collected from 15 injections (200 μL/injection) with aretention time of 6.90−7.50 min (Figure S5) using a detectionwavelength of 210 nm.Antibacterial Activity. Four bacterial species reported as importantbird pathogenic bacteria and zoonotic pathogens17 were selected asthe test strains for this study. The strains used were Enterococcusfaecalis ATCC 29213 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 (Gram-positive)and Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 19585 and Escherichia coli ATCC25922 (Gram-negative). Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity ofboth the bark extracts and authentic pure metabolites was performedby broth microdilution assay following recommendations outlined bythe CLSI standard.18 In brief, bacteria were grown on Mueller Hintonagar for 24 h at 37 °C and resuspended in sterile normal salinesolution and turbidity of the bacterial suspension was evaluated usinga McFarland densitometer (DEN-1, BioSan, Warren MI, USA). Allwillow bark extracts were dissolved in water at a concentration of 20or 100 mg/mL. Picein, salicin, and triandrin were dissolved in water ata concentration of 20 mg/mL, (+)-catechin was dissolved in ethanolat 50 mg/mL, and (−)-epicatechin in 1:1 water/acetone at 10 mg/mL. The test samples were diluted in cation-adjusted Mueller Hintonbroth to 2 times the final concentration. Minimum and maximumcontrols with the diluent and a positive control [ciprofloxacin atminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] were also prepared. 100μL of the sample and control dilutions were transferred onto a clearsterile 96-well plate in triplicate, followed by 100 μL of the bacterialsuspension of 106 cfu/mL. No bacterial suspension was added intothe minimum control. The assay plate was incubated at 37 °C with ashaking speed of 500 rpm (PST-60HL-4 Thermoshaker, BioSan), andbacterial growth was visually assessed after 24 h. The initial screeningwas performed at a concentration of 1 mg/mL (for bark extracts) or 3mg/mL (for authentic metabolites). The selection of initial screeningconcentration was dictated by substance solubility and the amount ofsubstance available for the analysis. Dose−response assays wereperformed for compounds demonstrating strong antibacterial activity,and MICs were determined as the lowest concentration resulting inno visible bacterial growth. We used the following dilution scheme:from 1 to 0.3 mg/mL with the dilution step 0.1 mg/mL for crudeextracts and from 2 to 0.25 mg/mL with the dilution step 0.25 for(+)-catechin and triandrin. The dose−response assays were repeatedtwo times. In cases when the obtained MIC values did not match butfell within ±1 dilution, we performed a third repeat and reported theMIC value obtained in two matching experiments out of three.Statistical analysis for the antibacterial activity study is not applicableto the data sets of two independent experiments (performed intriplicate wells).Toxicological Evaluation. Acute aquatic toxicity of the willow(hybrid Karin) bark extract was evaluated with the freshwatermicrocrustacean Daphnia similis according to ABNT NBR 12713 andOECD 202.19 Solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized barkextract in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Test solutions were preparedin culture media using a maximum concentration of 0.1% of DMSO.A negative control was included in the test (0.1% DMSO). Twentyneonates (<24 h old) from 2- to 3-week old mothers were placed infour replicates for each concentration (five organisms/replicate).Tests were performed at 21 ± 1 °C under a photoperiod of 16 h lightand 8 h darkness. After 48 h, the number of immobile daphnids wasrecorded. Tests were considered valid when immobility in thenegative controls did not exceed 10%.The mutagenicity was evaluated using the Salmonella/microsomemutagenicity assay at the limit of solubility in DMSO. MicroplateAgar, a miniaturized protocol,20 was used to evaluate the mutagenicactivity of two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains (TA98and TA100). Tests were performed in the absence and presence ofthe metabolic activation system provided by Aroclor 1254-inducedSprague Dawley rat liver S9 mix (MolTox, Boone, NC) with therequired cofactors (S9 mixture) at 5% (v/v) concentration. DMSOJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry pubs.acs.org/JAFC Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08161J. Agric. Food Chem. 2022, 70, 2948−29562949was used as the negative control. Positive controls for TA98 andTA100 were 1.25 ng/μL nitroquinoline-oxide (4NQO) (Sigma-Aldrich) without S9 and 5 ng/μL 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) (Sigma-Aldrich) with S9. After 66 h incubation period, the number ofrevertant colonies was counted using a stereomicroscope. Toxicitywas evaluated by the careful inspection of the background of theplates.Statistical Analysis. For the toxicological studies, in the Daphniaacute toxicity test, data were statistically analyzed using the Hill 1 bythe logistic regression method (Origin lab) for estimating the 50%effective (immobilization) concentrations (EC50). In the mutagenicityassay, experimental data were analyzed with the Salanal program(Integrated Laboratory Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC) usinganalysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a linear regression. Thesample was considered positive when both the ANOVA (p ≤ 0.05)and linear regression provided significant responses (p ≤ 0.05).Chemical Characterization. Gas Chromatography. Roughly, 1mg of the lyophilized crude water extract was trimethysilylated with amixture of pyridine, BSTFA, and TMCS (1:4:1, v/v/v) at 70 °C forca. 1 h. Xylitol, heneicosylic acid, and betulinol were used as internalstandards to quantify the compounds of interest from the waterextracts. The trimethylsilylated analytes were separated on a HP-Icolumn (25 m × 0.2 mm, 0.11 μm film) and detected by flameionization detection (FID). A temperature of 250 °C and a split ratioof 1:30 were set for the injector. Column oven temperature [gaschromatography (GC) I, Figure S6] was maintained at 100 °C for 8min, increased first to 170 °C at 2 °C/min, and then to 310 °C at 12°C/min. Another temperature program (GC II, Figure S7) wasapplied according to a previous study.15 The two differenttemperature programs (GC I and GC II) were designed for optimalseparation and quantitation of the analytes in each case. “Mean” and“standard deviation” have been applied to calculate the average of thechemical composition of the Salix water extracts based on triplicate-independent measurements per each sample. Statistical analysis is notapplied here. Standard deviations are shown as error bars of the mean,which indicates the variance of the reported results.Quantitation of Monosaccharides by HPAEC-PAD. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed ampero-metric detection (HPAEC-PAD) was applied as an alternativemethod to quantify monosaccharides in the bark extracts as describedearlier.10NMR Spectroscopy. 1H, 13C, and 1H−13C heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) measurements were conducted using a400 MHz Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer. The samples weredissolved in DMSO-d6:pyridine-d5 (4:1).21 HSQC spectra wereacquired (spectral widths of 10.5 and 165 ppm for 1H and 13C,respectively) using a relaxation delay (d1) of 2 s, 1K data points, 128t1 increments, and 100 transients. 1H NMR spectra were acquiredusing a spectral width of 16 ppm, a d1 of 1s, and 64K data points.1,3,5-Trioxane (δC 93.1, δH 5.12 ppm) was applied as an internalstandard for the quantification of aromatic metabolites by 1H NMRspectroscopy. The following parameters were applied for 13C NMRspectroscopy: a spectral width of 236 ppm, a d1 of 2s, and 65Ktransients of 64K data points. The spectral images were processedusing Topspin 4.0 (Bruker).High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry. The high-resolution massspectrometry (HRMS) spectra were acquired using an Agilent 6350QTOF mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, USA) equipped with dualelectrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to the Agilent 1260 InfinityHPLC system (Singapore). The flow rate was 0.25 mL/min(acetonitrile/ultrapure water, 1:1), and the injection volume was 2μL. Analytes were measured in the positive ion mode, and thecapillary voltage was set to +3500 V. Drying gas flow was set to 11 L/min with a temperature of 300 °C. Nebulizer, fragmentor, skimmer,and octopole radiofrequency were set to 25 psi, 150, 65, and 500 V,respectively. Mass measurement was performed in the HRMS modewith a mass range m/z 100−1100. The mass accuracy of theinstrument using external calibration was specified to be ≤3 ppm.■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONComposition of Willow Bark Extracts. Previously, it wasfound that both temperature and time affected the extractionyield of willow (hybrid Karin) bark to some extent.10 Themajor components of the extract were glucose, fructose,triandrin, picein, and catechin, but the effect of temperatureand time on the yield of individual compounds was notdetermined. Therefore, this aspect is further studied here toassist in the selection of the optimal analytical method forquantification. However, the systematic quantification of theindividual compound under the effect of temperature and timeis out of scope of this present study. This time, extraction wasapplied to ground bark (1 mm size), which led to ca. 5 wt %units higher gravimetric yield compared to bark cut to 2 cmlength (Table S3). Obviously, the grinding of bark broke atFigure 1. Gas chromatograms of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the (a) bark extract of willow hybrid Tora (harvested on Dec 4) with the internalstandard (Xylitol, Std) and (b) “raffinose-rich” fraction of the extract (Figure S5).Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry pubs.acs.org/JAFC Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08161J. Agric. Food Chem. 2022, 70, 2948−29562950least part of the cells and shortened the diffusion timedramatically. In further experiments, the extractions were stillcarried out at 80 °C for 20 min because the significant crudewater extract yield can be achieved based on a study for willowhybrid Karin,10 although these phytochemicals for willowhybrid Klara can be extracted in water with ease at 50 °Cwithin 10 min (Table S4).To be sure about the reliability of the data, several analyticaltechniques were compared for the quantification of thephytochemicals in the extracts, although each measurementper analytic was performed once. The techniques appliedincluded GC with two different column oven temperatureprograms, HPAEC−PAD and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Slowerinitial increase in the column oven temperature (GC-I)showed a better separation of individual monosaccharides byGC (Figures S6 and S7), although the temperature ramp-uprate did not really affect the quantitation of the totalmonosaccharide content (Tables S4 and S5). In comparisonwith GC, HPAEC-PAD tended to provide 14−61% higherglucose contents and 2−26% lower fructose contents (TableS6), but the difference in the analyzed overall monosaccharidecontent was 3.3−10.2% between the methods (Tables S4 andS5). The slower oven temperature increase (GC-II) in the endof the GC analysis provided slightly better separation (FiguresS6 and S7) and higher response of the aromatic phytochem-icals (Tables S4 and S5). Results from the quantitation oftriandrin by two independent methods, GC-II and 1H NMRspectroscopy, correlated well, although the latter one provided5.0−13.9% higher contents for all hybrids except the hybridKlara (Figure S8). Based on all observations, GC-II wasselected as an accurate and simple technique for thesimultaneous quantitation of the aromatic compounds andsugars in the extracts.Knowledge on the variation in the entire chemical profile ofthe Salix bark extracts is necessary in understanding the originof their potential antibacterial activity. In addition to thepreviously reported glucose, fructose, picein, triandrin, salicin,and (+)-catechin,21−23 sucrose and trace amounts of severalneutral monosaccharides (Table S6) and glucuronic acid(Tables S4 and S5) were present in the extracts. Gaschromatograms of several extracts had an additional majorpeak close to betulinol that was used as an internal standard(Figures 1 and S9). The EI mass spectrum of this compoundshowed great similarity with the spectrum of trimethylsilylatedsucrose (Figure S10). Match with the retention time ofauthentic raffinose supported the assignment to the trisacchar-ide that has been reported to be present in willow honey(Figure 1).24To confirm the assignment, preparative HPLC was appliedto isolate a “raffinose-rich” fraction from the bark extract ofwillow hybrid Tora. The elemental composition determined byHRMS confirmed the presence of mono- (glucose andfructose), di- (sucrose), tri- (C18H32O16), and tetrasaccharides(C24H42O21) of which tri- and disaccharides were the mostdominant ones in this order (Figure 2 and Table 1). Theelemental composition of an additional component(C15H28O13) signaled the presence of a glycerol disaccharide,such as the rare sugar fuzinoside.25 A comparison between theNMR spectra of the original extract, its “raffinose-rich”fraction, and authentic raffinose confirmed its presence(Figures 3, S11, and S12).26 However, the HSQC NMRspectrum of the structurally related tetrasaccharide stachyose isvery similar to the spectrum of raffinose which might hide theweaker stachyose signals.26 However, based on HRMS, atetrasaccharide was present, which is here tentatively assignedas stachyose.Effect of Hybrid Type and Harvesting Season onPhytochemistry. Both raffinose and stachyose are known ascryoprotectant oligosaccharides that have a high response tothe cold hardening of several plants including Salix.27 In fact,the raffinose content of the bark extracts was the highest whenthe Salix stems were harvested during the winter (Figure 4).However, the seasonal effect on the content of aromaticcomponents (i.e., salicin, picein, catechin, and triandrin) wasnot as clear as the effects on sucrose and raffinose in Figure 4.Figure 2. ESI HRMS spectrum (rt: 0.877 min) of the isolated “raffinose-rich” fraction (Figure S5).Table 1.

Agric. Food Chem. 2022, 70, 2948−29562951The aromatic phytochemical composition of the Salix barkextracts (Figure 5 and Table S8) varied largely depending onthe hybrid or species. Only (+)-catechin was presentapproximately in an equal amount (15−25 mg/g) independentof the Salix hybrid. Catechin is quite unstable under neutralpH but rather stable under an acidic environment.28 Triandrinwas always present, but its content showed large variation (8−170 mg/g) between the samples, whereas picein occurred onlyin S. myrsinifolia and hybrid Karin. In comparison withtriandrin, the content of salicin was low and varied largelybetween the samples.The gravimetric extraction yield varied between 12−25%depending on the sample (Figure S14), and the assignedphytochemicals corresponded to 18−47% of the extract (TableS8). Recently, preparative chromatography was applied for theefficient fractionation of willow hybrid Karin water extract.15The unassigned fractions (ca. 50 wt %) included coloredsubstances that could possibly originate from condensedtannins.

The gravimetric extraction yields are summarized in Figure S13.Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry pubs.acs.org/JAFC Articlehttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08161J. Agric. Food Chem. 2022, 70, 2948−29562952contained several broad “background” signals at chemical shiftsthat are characteristic for polymeric condensed tannins (FigureS15).29 Condensed tannin (or proanthocyanidin) is a naturalmacromolecular polymer, with a molecular weight of 500−3000 Da, present at most vascular plants. It usually contains agroup of flavonoids that derived mostly from flavan-3-olsrepeating units and a smaller portion of saccharides.Flavonoids, polyphenol with C6−C3−C6 skeleton, areantibacterial agents against pathogenic microorganisms.30,31Therefore, this biomass colorant (rich in flavonoids) may havethe strongest antibacterial activity among the metabolites.However, this is beyond the scope of this present study.Antimicrobial Activity and Toxicological Evaluation.Hybrid selection of their bark extract is based on their differentabundance (Table S9) of bioactive chemical components.Initial screening of bark extracts (1 mg/mL) of selectedhybrids (Klara, Karin, S. myrsinofolia, Tora, and Erna) showedstrong antibacterial activity against S. aureus but not againstthree other bacterial species E. faecalis, S. typhimurium, and E.coli (Table S9). S. aureus is a Gram-positive microorganismwith widely occurring resistance to a variety of antibiotics, suchas methicillin, and is in the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by the World Health Organization.32 Activityagainst S. aureus was investigated in more detail by testing theactivity of individual metabolites (triandrin, (+)-catechin,salicin, and picein) and determining MIC values for thecompounds which inhibited bacterial growth, as well as MICvalues of selected hybrid extracts. Only triandrin (MIC of 1.25mg/mL) and (+)-catechin (MIC of 1.75 mg/mL)33 showedsignificant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, resulting inthe eradication of viable bacteria after 24 h incubation (Table2).One of the major mechanisms of AMR in bacteria ismediated by their ability to remove antibiotics from the cells.Thus, the resistant bacteria possess efficient efflux systemsknown as multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps, which couldreduce the intracellular concentrations of antibiotics to anineffective level. This also suggests that antibiotics can be moreeffective if the pump action can be inhibited.34 Although piceinand salicin did not show any inhibition against S. aureus atconcentrations up to 3 mg/mL, they may potentiate thediscovered antimicrobials (triandrin and (+)-catechin) byinhibiting toward the NorA transporter (an MDR efflux pump)of S. aureus.34 This may explain the higher inhibition efficiencyof the bark extract on the growth of S. aureus (MIC of 0.6−0.8mg/mL),35 when compared to their individual metabolites. Onthe other hand, MIC values of the extracts did not correlatewith their triandrin contents (Table 2). The MIC values of the(+)-catechin and the crude water extracts were comparable tothose of previous studies;33,35 however, the MIC of triandrinwas reported for the first time to the best of our knowledge.These results show the diverse antimicrobial activity of Salixmetabolites both from different hybrids and their individualphytochemicals.

Noacute toxicity was observed for the microcrustacean D. similis atthe limit of solubility (25 mg/L) because no statisticaldifferences in the concentration response were observedwhen the logistic regression was applied (Table S10).Additionally, the willow bark water extracts did not presentmutagenic activity in S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strainswith and without S9 at 5% because no statistical increase in thenumber of revertant per well in comparison to the negativecontrol was observed according to the ANOVA p-values(Table 3). Overall, our study has shown the promisingpotential of utilizing the willow bark water extracts in reducingthe overwhelming dependence on reliance of the syntheticantibiotics.In conclusion, the extract was nontoxic to Daphnia andnonmutagenic to bacteria and showed a high antibacterialeffect on the growth of S. aureus. No direct correlation betweenthe antibacterial activity and the chemical composition of theextracts was found. Raffinose is for the first time systematicallypurified through preparative HPLC, characterized throughGC−MS/GC-FID examination, and further verified throughGC-FID, NMR, and LC-HRMS. The bark extract compositionvaried greatly between the willow hybrids and species. Unliketriandrin and (+)-catechin, large amounts of picein werepresent in few cases only. The greatest seasonal variation wasobserved for sucrose and raffinose which were specificallypresent in samples harvested during winter. This explorationmay launch a new era for applying Salix metabolites asgenuinely novel antimicrobials to improve our resistancetoward zoonotic pathogens, not only to enhance the growthproductivity and gut health of food animals. Additional workwill be needed to fully characterize the bark extracts(particularly the flavonoid-rich tannins) and the synergisticmechanisms behind their antibacterial activity. We willinvestigate, in vivo, the effect of Salix metabolites on animalperformance and intestinal health. We aim to understand andestablish the exact mechanisms associated with bacteriologicalchanges in gut microbiota to optimize their use as effectiveantimicrobials, all of which are considered as a key step towardthe complete willow biorefinery.37,38■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT*sı Supporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge athttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08161.Profile information, preparative-HPLC chromatogram,gas chromatogram, GC−MS spectrum, and NMRspectrum of the Salix hybrids (PDF)■ AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding AuthorJinze Dou − Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems,School of Chemical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo02150, Finland; orcid.org/0000-0001-8782-3381;Email: jinze.dou@aalto.fiAuthorsPolina Ilina − Drug Research Program, Division ofPharmaceutical Biosciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universityof Helsinki, Helsinki 00014, FinlandJarl Hemming − Johan Gadolin Process Chemistry Centre, c/oLaboratory of Natural Materials Technology, Åbo AkademiUniversity, Turku 20500, FinlandKiia Malinen − Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems,School of Chemical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo02150, FinlandHeidi Mäkkylä − Drug Research Program, Division ofPharmaceutical Biosciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universityof Helsinki, Helsinki 00014, FinlandNatália Oliveira de Farias − Laboratory of Ecotoxicology andGenotoxicityLAEG, School of Technology, University ofCampinas, Campinas 13083-970, BrazilPäivi Tammela − Drug Research Program, Division ofPharmaceutical Biosciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universityof Helsinki, Helsinki 00014, Finland; orcid.org/0000-0003-4697-8066Table 3.
