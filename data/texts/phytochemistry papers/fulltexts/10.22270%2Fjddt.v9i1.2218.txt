INTRODUCTION 
Medicinal plants have been used worldwide by indigenous 
populations, playing an important role in the treatment of 
human and animal diseases. More recently, the majority of 
modern drugs have been developed from isolated 
compounds of medicinal plants, based on their 
ethnopharmacological uses/applications. The role of natural 
products on drug development has been increasing, not only 
when the bioactive compounds are directly used as 
therapeutic agents but also when they are used as raw 
material for drug synthesis, or as a base model for new 
biologically active compounds. However, validating and 
using plants as a phytopharmaceutical requires a great deal 
of basic and applied research, in order to set this resource at 
the same level of importance of conventional pharmaceutical 
products. Moreover, only about 10% of 250,000 species of 
plants estimated worldwide have been scientifically studied 
with potential use in healthcare. Also, around 60,000 species 
will probably become extinct by the year of 2050, so it is 
urgent to search for new compounds with therapeutic 
interest. Medicinal plants have remained the major sources 
of drugs; in fact many of the currently available drugs were 
derived either directly or indirectly from them. The 
approach to new drugs through natural products has proved 
to be the single most successful strategy for the discovery of 
new drugs. In the past decade, research has been focussed on 
the scientific evolution of traditional drugs of plant origin for 
the treatment of various diseases. 
Rosmarinus officinalis L. is a medicinal plant that belongs to 
the Lamiaceae family and is commonly known as rosemary. 
Besides the culinary uses due to the characteristic aroma, 
this plant is also widely employed by indigenous 
populations, where it grows wild1,2. R. officinalis is a woody, 
perennial herb with fragrant, evergreen, needle like leaves 
and white, pink, purple or blue flowers. This is a powerful 
herb that originates from Mediterrean region. It is derived 
from the latin word ros (dew) and marinus (sea) which 
means ‘dew of the sea’. Forms range from upright to trailing: 
the upright forms can reach 1.5 m (5ft) tall, rarely 2 m (6ft 7 
in). The leaves are evergreen, 2-4 cm (0.8-1.6 in) long and 2-
5 mm broad, green above and white below, with dense, 
short, woolly hair. Rosemary has a tendency to flower out-

side, its normal flowering season; it has been known to 
flower as late as early December, as early as mid-February. 
The taxonomic classification and anatomy of this plant were 
well documented and discussed by many researchers. It 
contains triterpenoids, diterpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic 
acids. Usage of herbal plants is as common as old ages. The 
current researchers are more focused on natural chemicals 
than the synthetic chemicals due to their environmental, 
economical and health benefits plants produce many 
chemical compounds for its biological activities including 
defensive mechanism against microbes, insects and 
herbivorous animals and these chemicals are called as 
phytochemicals. Herbal plants are a natural source of many 
important phytochemicals and widely used in 
pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries. A wide variety 
of herbal plants are available in the Indian subcontinent and 
they are the backbone of Indian traditional medicinal system, 
Ayurveda and Siddha3. 
Rosemary has been named the herb of the year in 2001 by 
the international herb association. It was introduced to 
Britain by the Romans and is still particularly loved today by 
the Italians and the British, who use it frequently in their 
cooking. In ancient Greece and Rome rosemary was believed 
to strengthen the memory, which accounts for its been 
known as the herb of remembrance and fidelity. Rosemary 
was an essential part of the apothecary’s repertoire during 
the Renaissance. Hippocrates, Galen, Dioscorides prescribed 
rosemary for liver problems. Rosemary is not a popular plant 
in India. It was introduced by the Europeans as a garden 
plant due to its present fragrant scented leaves. Medicinal 
plants are the native heritage with the universal importance. 
The actual amount of constituents present varies according 
to the stage of development, variety of plant, season 
harvested, origin of leaves, extraction methods. As 
accordingly, the crude extracts are used for biosynthetic 
preparations of new drugs. In ancient medical system, 
various parts of plants such as stem bark, root bark, aerial 
roots, vegetative buds, leaves, fruits and latex are used to 
cure various ailments. Herbal medicines are very much 
secured than the others. Medicinal plants are the sources of a 
large number of combinations of herbs and modern 
medicine. Indian people have an incredible passion for 
medicinal plants and they use them for a lot of health related 
applications. Approximately, 25000 plant based 
formulations are available in the ethnic medical texts. Also, 
the modern medicine contains minimum 25% drugs 
produced from plants and many others which are artificial 
drugs manufactured on original compounds isolated from 
plants. India is one of the richest medicinal herbal granaries 
in the world that is of remarkable modern application, 
ensuring health security to millions of people4. 
Rosmarinus officinalis is a species within the Rosmarinus 
(genus) and the Lamiaceae family. There are many common 
names, it is so commonly called as rosemary it is found 
throughout India, it is known for its various uses in the fields 
of medicine and agriculture. R. officinalis is distributed in 
Southern Europe, Meditterean basil, Northern Africa and 
Southern Asia. The herb has been hailed since ancient times 
for its medicinal properties, rosemary was traditionally used 
to help alleviate muscle pain, improve memory, boost the 
immune and promote the hair growth. Leaves are used as 
culinary condiments, to make bodily perfumes and for its 
potential health benefits. Flowers are considered useful for 
making of sachets. Rosemary has been found to be a 
stimulant and mild analgesic, for skin tumours4.

Rosmarinus officinalis is commonly known as Rosemary; 
Rosemary is evergreen, usually erect, bushy shrub up to 2m 
tall and wide. Stem indistinctly quadrangular finely grey 
pubescent. Leaves opposite, tufted on the branches, sessile to 
short, petiolate, blade linear, 1-5cm×1-2mm, base attenuate, 
margin entire but revolute, apex obtuse, leathery, dark 
glossy, sea green and sub glabrous above, white felted 
tomentose beneath, aromatically fragrant when crushed. 
Inflorescence Racemose, axillary 5-10 flowered, 0.5-2.5 cm 
long, terminating short lateral branches, pedicle 2-5mm long, 
calyx campanulate, 2-lipped, 5-6mm long, densely stellate 
tomentose, upper lip small and 3 dentate, lower lip 2–lobed,

lower lip 3-lobed above 7mm long, with large concave 
middle lobe; 2 anterior stamens perfect, 7-8 mm long, 
ascending under the base of the upper lip, two posterior 
stamens reduced to hardly visible staminodes, pistil with 
deeply 4-parite ovary style incurved, 1.5 cm long ending into 
2 short, unequal branches with stigma. Fruit composed of 4 
sub-globose to obovoid nut-lets, above 2mm long, glabrous 
and smooth72.   
Phytochemical studies 
The characteristic aroma of camphor4,5,6,8. The main 
constituents of the rosemary essential oil are camphor (5.0–
21%), 1,8-cineole (15–55%), α-pinene (9.0–26%), borneol 
(1.5–5.0%), camphene (2.5–12%), β-pinene (2.0–9.0%) and 
limonene (1.5–5.0%) in proportions that vary according to 
the vegetative stage and bioclimatic conditions4. Regarding 
the extracts, the phytochemicals mainly present in R. 
officinalis are rosmarinic acid, camphor, caffeic acid, ursolic 
acid, betulinic acid, carnosic acid and carnosol4,7. 
Therefore, R. officinalis is mainly composed of phenolic 
compounds, di and triterpenes and essential oils9,10. 
In traditional medicine, the leaves of R. officinalis are used 
based on their anti-bacterial activities, carminative and as 
analgesic in muscles and joints4. Also, rosemary's essential 
oils and extracts obtained from flowers and leaves are used 
Kompelly et al                                                                                                          Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(1):323-330 
ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [326]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTA
  
to treat minor wounds, rashes, headache, dyspepsia, 
circulation problems, but also as an expectorant, diuretic and 
anti-spasmodic in renal colic4,7. Polyphenols are anti-oxidant 
chemical compounds primarily responsible for the fruit 
colouring, which are classified as phenolic acids, flavonoids 
and non-flavonoids11. In addition to their antioxidant 
properties, they play a very important role in the plant 
defences against herbivores, pathogens and predators; 
therefore, they have an application in the control of 
infectious agents in humans11. In R. officinalis, the most 
common polyphenols are apigenin, diosmin, 
luteolin, genkwanin and phenolic acids (>3%), especially 
rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid3,5. 
Other major compounds common in rosemary are terpenes, 
usually present in essential oils and resins, which include 
over 10,000 compounds divided into mono, di, tri and 
sesquiterpenes, depending on the number of carbon atoms 
and isoprene groups (C5H8)11. It is possible to find in 
rosemary terpenes such as epirosmanol, carnosol, carnosic 
acid, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid (triterpenes)3,4,7. 
However, the carnosic acid, which is converted to carnosol 
by oxidation, has physicochemical, thermal and photo-labile 
properties, which can be avoided by a supercritical fluid 
extraction (low temperature operation)12. In 2014, five new 
compounds were identified in an ethanolic extract of R. 
officinalis, the officinoterpenoside A1 and A2 (diterpenoid 
glycosides), officino-terpenoside B and C (triterpenoid 
glycosides) and officinoterpenoside D 
(normonoterpenoid)13. Regarding the most studied 
compounds from R. officinalis and their biological activities, 
the increased pharmacological potential is clear for carnosic 
acid and the essential oil of rosemary. 
Pharmacological value 
Rosemary oil is used as a food seasoning14, due to its 
chemical compound constituents responsible for the anti-
bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-oxidant properties. 
Traditionally, rosemary oil has been shown to possess a 
number of applications in managing or curing many diseases 
such as inflammatory diseases15 and diabetes mellitus16. On 
the other hand, the bioactivities of rosemary extracts include 
properties such as anti-inflammatory17, anti-diabetic18, 
hepatoprotective19 and anti-microbial activity20. These 
bioactivities are related to the phenolic compound 
constituents (mainly caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and 
carnosic acid). 
Anti-oxidant activity 
The anti-oxidative activity of rosemary extracts has been 
evaluated using different solvents. In this regard, Inatani et 
al.21 reported that rosmanol, showed an antioxidant capacity 
four times higher than BRT and BRA (synthetic anti-
oxidants) in both linoleic acid and lard. In addition, this 
study reported the antioxidant activity of carnosol and 
rosmanol by TBA and ferric thiocyanate methods. They 
reported the correlation between activity and chemical 
structure as an anti-oxidant. Aruoma et al.22 studied the anti-
oxidant and pro-oxidant properties of rosemary. The main 
constituents with anti-oxidant properties are carnosic acid 
and carnosol that are responsible for 90% of the properties. 
Both are inhibitors of lipid peroxidation in liposomal and 
microsomal systems, they are good scavengers of CCl3O2 
(peroxyl radicals), reduce cytochrome c and scavenge 
hydroxyl radicals. Specifically, carnosic acid scavenges H2O2, 
but could also act as a substrate for the peroxidase system. 
The anti-oxidant properties depend on fruiting stages: the 
increase in concentration of polyphenols, which include 
carnosol, rosmarinic acid and hesperidin, during the fruiting 
stage, is directly related to the improvement of the extract 
anti-oxidant capacity. This statement is supported by 
scientific papers previously published by Cui et al.23 and 
Kontogianni et al.70, who consider lactone carnosol as the 
main property responsible for this activity. Likewise, 
rosmarinic acid and hesperidin have been cited in literature 
as important free radical scavengers24,25. One of the most 
significant aspects of the anti-oxidant activity of rosemary is 
the relationship between diterpenes and radical-scavenging 
activity. The anti-oxidant activity of rosemary through 
animal diet has been reported in additional studies by: Lopez 
Bote et al.26 with 500 mg kg−1 in broiler diets; Descalzo et 
al.27 in feed of cattle; Petron et al.28 in lamb, in pork meat29, 
turkey meat products30,31, chicken meat26, hen’s meat32,33, 
cooked sausages34. Generally, the addition of rosemary 
extract into the meat products or through animal feed 
improved the meat lipid stability. On the contrary, O’Grady et 
al.36 and Galobart et al.37 included that feeding animals with 
rosemary did not improve the lipid stability of meat or eggs. 
As previously reported, the antioxidant effect of rosemary is 
due to the polyphenols present in the leaves (mainly 
rosmarinic acid, carnosol and carnosic acid), which 
accumulate in the fatty membranes of cells where the anti-
oxidant effect is required31. 
Anti-microbial activity 
The anti-bacterial effect of rosemary has been widely 
demonstrated in several food studies: beef meatballs39, 
cooked beef40 and in pork sausage41, and the anti-bacterial 
activity of rosemary oil against E. coli, Bacillus cereus, 
Staphylococcus aureus37, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium 
perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus and 
Salmonella choleraesuis was reported. This essential oil was 
incorporated into meat reporting anti-bacterial activity 
against Brochothrix thermosphacta and Enterobacteriaceae38. 
Anti-proliferative activity 
The crude ethanolic rosemary extract has differential anti-
proliferative effects on human leukemia and breast 
carcinoma cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
was estimated at 1/700, 1/400, 1/150 and 1/500 dilutions, 
for the HL60, K562, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, 
respectively44,46,70. 
Hepatoprotectivity 
The hepatoprotective effects of the aqueous extract of the 
Egyptian rosemary against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. 
Rosemary inhibited and reduced the CCl4-induced 
hepatotoxicity in rats possibly by scavenging or blocking the 
formation of free radicals generated during CCl4 metabolism. 
These improving effects of rosemary could be attributed to 
the bioactive constituents that alleviated the deleterious 
effect of CCl4 either by the well-known scavenging action or 
the anti-oxidant properties that inhibited lipid per-oxidation, 
stabilized the reactive radicals, preserve the cellular 
integrity and restrain the severity of CCl425,43. 
Anti-cancer activity 
Many studies have reported on the anticancer mechanisms 
of Rosmarinus officinalis. Rosemary has displayed significant 
anti proliferative activities against several human cancer cell 
lines. Major compounds in the plant’s extract, such as 
carnosic acid, carnosol, and rosemarinic acid, have been 
shown to induce apoptosis within these cancer cells, possibly 
through the production of nitric oxide44-46. Carnosic acid 
appears to be the strongest promoter of apoptosis44,46. 
Rosemary extract also has intriguing anti-tumorigenic 
activity. In one study, the extract was found to strongly 
Kompelly et al                                                                                                          Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(1):323-330 
ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [327]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTA
  
inhibit skin tumorigenesis in mice by preventing carcinogens 
from binding to epidermal DNA47. This anti carcinogenic 
effect is caused by the extract’s antioxidant activity48. These 
anti proliferative and anti tumorigenic activities of R. 
officinalis can possibly be utilized in future cancer 
treatments and warrant further investigation. 
Anti-diabetic activity 
Diabetes mellitus is a growing worldwide disorder. By 2025, 
an estimated 300 million people will be diabetic, and global 
costs of treating the disease could reach US $1 trillion 
annually49. The development of diabetes is often fostered by 
high oxidative stress; pancreatic β-cells are especially 
vulnerable to reactive oxygen species, leading to decreased 
insulin secretion and higher blood glucose levels4. This 
information has prompted new diabetes treatments to focus 
on natural anti-oxidants, particularly those found in plants. 
Not surprisingly, multiple studies have identified Rosmarinus 
officinalis as a promising anti diabetic agent. Rosemary’s 
anti-oxidant properties execute several anti diabetic and 
hypoglycemic mechanisms. In one study, rosemary extract 
lowered blood glucose levels in normoglycemic, 
hyperglycemic, and diabetic rabbits. By inhibiting lipid 
peroxidation and activating antioxidant enzymes, the extract 
also promoted insulin secretion49. Rosemary was also found 
to alleviate delayed wound healing, a serious complication of 
diabetes50. These anti diabetic activities are attributable to 
the body’s improved antioxidant status after administration 
of rosemary51. 
Anti depressant activity 
The potential use of Rosmarinus officinalis as an anti 
depressant was the focus of many research articles reviewed 
for this project24. The majorities of these studies involved 
two tests that are used to model anti-depressant like effects 
in mice-the Tail Suspension Test (TST) and Forced 
Swimming Test (FST). The administration of rosemary 
continuously decreased the immobility time of mice in both 
the TST and the FST, indicating an anti-depressant like effect. 
Rosemary’s anti-depressant potential was further bolstered 
when it was found to decrease exploratory and anhedonic-
like behavior in bulb ectomized mice52. There is much 
evidence that the antidepressant activity of R. officinalis 
depends on interactions with the monoaminergic system. 
Rosemary is believed to enhance dopaminergic, 
serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic functions 
within the brain, possibly explaining its antidepressant 
effects. Rosemary has also been found to increase the 
concentration of neurotransmitters in the brains of mice53. 
Several compounds in rosemary extract and essential oil are 
responsible for its anti depressant activity, including 
carnosol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid and polyphenols53-55. 
Neuroprotective activity 
Remarkably, Rosmarinus officinalis has demonstrated 
significant neuroprotective effects against 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and 
dementia. Rosemary has displayed inhibitory activities 
against the two enzymes in the brain responsible for the 
breakdown of Acetylcholine-Cholinesterase (AChE) and 
Butyryl Cholinesterase (BChE). These anti-AChE and anti-
BChE activities are likely caused by rosemarinic acid and 
terpene compounds in the plant’s essential oil56,57. By 
increasing total choline levels in the brain, rosemary could 
attenuate not just Alzheimer’s disease, but also memory loss, 
anxiety, and depression58,59. Two more studies highlight the 
neuro-protective ability of R. officinalis. In the first, 
polyphenols present in rosemary extract were found to 
inhibit stress proteins, which play a role in the 
neurodegenerative process60. The second study concluded 
that rosemary promotes the production of Nerve Growth 
Factor (NGF), a protein vital to the growth and maintenance 
of nerve tissue. Increased NGF levels can help alleviate 
Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and other neurodegenerative 
diseases61. Both these studies clearly demonstrate 
rosemary’s growing potential as a neuroprotective. 
Anti-inflammatory activity 
Rosmarinus officinalis displayed potent anti-inflammatory 
mechanisms in several of the reviewed studies17. Rosemary 
essential oil and extract were found to significantly inhibit 
leukocyte migration in vivo62. This reduced the number of 
leukocytes (White Blood Cells) at the site of inflammation, 
resulting in an anti-inflammatory response63,64. Rosemary 
extract also inhibited other proinflammatory substances, 
such as nitric oxide and inflammation associated genes64-65. 
While carnosol and carnosic acid appear to be particularly 
important, the anti-inflammatory activity of rosemary most 
likely depends on a synergistic mechanism between many of 
its components62,63. These studies suggest that the anti-
inflammatory effect of R. officinalis is rather strong; in fact, 
the anti-inflammatory activities of pure carnosol and 
carnosic acid were found to be nine times higher than that of 
Indomethacin, a common anti-inflammatory drug agent63. 
Anti-obesity activity 
While only three studies reported anti-obesity activities of 
Rosmarinus officinalis, their findings are very noteworthy. All 
three found rosemary to effectively limit weight gain, but 
each study identified a different mechanism to explain this 
response. In one study, extracted carnosic acid was found to 
suppress adipocyte differentiation. This inhibition of 
adipogenesis can promote sustainable weight loss66. In 
another study, rosemary extract prevented weight gain by 
limiting lipid absorption in the intestine. This was made 
possible through the inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity67. 
Finally, the third study found rosemary extract to inhibit 
lipid synthesis through the suppression of Diacylglycerol 
Acyltransferase (DGAT), the main enzyme responsible for 
the production of triglycerides68. The results of all three 
studies indicate that R. officinalis has great potential as an 
effective treatment against obesity and other metabolic 
disorders66-68. 
Ulcerative colitis 
Excessive accumulation and activation of phagocytes in the 
gut may cause severe damage and may be reduced by anti-
oxidant. This study was carried out to investigate the effects 
of rosemary leaves hydroalcoholic extract (RHE) and 
essential oil (REO) in a well-defined model of experimental 
colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in 
rats. Different doses of RHE (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) and 
REO (100, 200 and 400 μl/kg) were administered orally and 
intraperitoneally (100, 400 mg/kg and 100, 400 μl/kg) to 
male Wistar rats (n=6), 6 h after colitis induction and 
continued for 5 days by intracolonic instillation of 0.25 ml 
TNBS (80 mg/kg)/ethanol 50% v/v. Wet colon 
weight/length ratio was measured and tissue damage scores 
as well as indices of colitis were evaluated both 
macroscopically and histopathologically. RHE and REO at all 
test doses used were effective to reduce colon tissue lesions 
and colitis indices while greater doses were significantly 
effective to diminish histopathologic parameters irrespective 
to the route of administration. Administration of oral 
prednisolone, Asacol (mesalazine microgranules) and 
parenteral hydrocortisone acetate were effective to reduce

colon tissue injures as well. These data suggest that RHE and 
REO are both effective to possess anti-colitic activity, and 
reinforce the use of this plant as a remedy for inflammatory 
bowel diseases in traditional medicine69.

DISCUSSION 
Rosmarinus officinalis, an evergreen perennial shrub 
commonly known as rosemary, is garnering considerable 
attention from the food and medical industries due to its 
wide array of biological activities. Rosemary has been used 
as a source of traditional medicine for centuries, but its 
potential as a natural food preservative has only recently 
been investigated. Studies have shown that the strong 
antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the plant’s 
extracts make rosemary an ideal replacement for more toxic 
artificial food additives. As concern over these potentially 
harmful additives has grown, so has the demand for natural 
preservatives such as rosemary. While rosemary is 
beginning to be used as a preservative around the globe, 
more can be done to maximize the plant’s potential. 
Additional research is needed to identify the extracts and 
essential oils of rosemary that have the most potent 
preservative activities. Toxicity levels and potential side 
effects of rosemary must also be constantly monitored. 
Assuming it remains less toxic, R. officinalis should continue 
to replace artificial additives in many preservative 
applications, thereby reducing risk to consumers. 
Rosmarinus officinalis has also displayed many intriguing 
therapeutic properties. Rosemary’s anti-microbial, anti 
depressant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-
obesity activities all have potential in the treatment against 
various diseases. However, it is the anticancer and anti 
diabetic mechanisms of rosemary that warrant the most 
attention. Oxidative stress has been shown to contribute to 
the progression of diabetes mellitus and many forms of 
cancer. It is not surprising, then, that the strong anti-oxidant 
activity of rosemary extract and essential oil represents a 
promising new strategy in the treatment of both diseases. 
The plant’s ability to promote insulin secretion in diabetic 
patients and induce apoptosis within cancer cells is 
particularly intriguing. While these initial results have been 
encouraging, more clinical studies are needed before 
rosemary can be regularly used in humans. If it continues to 
display such promising anti-diabetic and anti-cancer 
activities with few side effects, R. officinalis could eventually 
provide an innovative treatment in the fight against these 
two serious diseases. 
CONCLUSION 
Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) has displayed exciting 
potential as both a natural food preservative and a 
therapeutic agent in the literature reviewed for this project. 
The low toxicity levels and strong anti-oxidant, anti-
bacterial, and anti-fungal activities of the plant’s extract 
make rosemary an effective food preservative with fewer 
side effects than artificial additives. The strong anti-oxidant 
compounds found in its extract and essential oil account for 
many of rosemary’s biological activities, including its anti 
diabetic and anticancer mechanisms. Rosemary has also 
been found to alleviate depression, neurodegenerative 
diseases, inflammation and obesity. While the initial results 
have been encouraging, additional research is needed to 
confirm the safety and efficacy of R. officinalis as a 
preservative and therapeutic agent. More studies are 
strongly recommended to establish the mechanisms are 
involved and the active constituents which are really 
responsible for its beneficial pharmacologic actions.
