Abstract Agastache is a small genus of Lamiaceae,
comprising 22 species of perennial aromatic medicinal
herbs. In this article, we review recent advances in
phytochemical, pharmacological, biotechnological
andmolecular research onAgastache. The phytochem-
ical profile of all Agastache species studied to date is
generally similar, consisted of two main metabolic
classes—phenylpropanoids and terpenoids. In the
relatively variable essential oils, most populations of
different Agastache species contain over 50 % of a
phenylallyl compound—estragole. Also, other volatile
compounds (methyleugenol, pulegone, menthone,
isomenthone and spathulenol) were reported in various
proportions. Major non-volatile metabolites belong to
phenolic compounds, such as caffeic acid derivatives,
especially rosmarinic acid as well as several flavones
and flavone glycosides like acacetin, tilianin, agasta-
choside, and a rare dimeric malonyl flavone
(agastachin). Two unique lignans—agastenol and
agastinol—were also isolated. Terpenoids include
triterpenoids of oleanane-type (maslinic acid, olean-
olic acid and β-amyrin), ursane-type (ursolic acid,
corosolic acid andα-amyrin), and typical plant sterols,
as well as abietane-type oxidized diterpenes (e.g.,
agastaquinone, agastol, and others). The bioactivity of
various extracts or individual compounds in vitro and
in vivo include antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-
mutagenic activity, cytotoxic activity to cancer cell
lines, and anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory, anti-
atherogenic, antioxidant as well as biocidal activity to
several foodstuff pests. Biotechnological and molec-
ular studies have focused on in vitro propagation and
enhancing the biosynthesis of bioactive metabolites in
cell or organ cultures, as well as on the expression of
genes involved in phenolic biosynthesis.

Introduction
Throughout the world, hundreds of Lamiaceae (Mint
family) species are used as medicinal and aromatic
plants. Some of them are among the most popular
spices and herbs, like basil, peppermint, sage, and
many others. Here, we would like to portray one
genus—Agastache Clayt. ex Gronov.—that has sim-
ilar properties but which is not as commonly
recognized. Plants from this genus are known under
the vernacular name ‘giant hyssop’. Some of these
plants are utilized as a source of essential oil, herbal
drugs, spice, nectariferous plants in beekeeping, or as
ornamentals. Their ornamental use is actually the
most common, making giant hyssops one of a few

examples in the mint family where decorative value
appears to overshadow its potential as a medicinal
plant. Almost 16 years have passed since the last (and
only) systematic review of the Agastache genus was
published (Fuentes-Granados et al. 1998). Since then,
significant progress in biological investigations has
been made. Apart from the morphological, cytoge-
netical, taxonomic, horticultural and biochemical
research that has been previously described, several
important biotechnological and molecular studies of
Agastache species have appeared in the meantime.
As a result of increasing interest in ethnic and
traditional phytotherapeutics, many new studies have
been undertaken to examine the pharmacological
properties of these herbs, including a few Agastache
species. So far, only a few species of the genus
Agastache have been fairly represented in the phy-
tochemical and pharmacological literature. Even so,
the available data sufficiently support the prospect of
increasing use of Agastache spp. and their constitu-
ents in herbal therapy.
In the present review, we discuss recent advances
in the phytochemistry, bioactivity, molecular biology
and biotechnology of Agastache, with an emphasis on
the following species: A. foeniculum, A. mexicana, A.
rugosa, A. scrophulariifolia and A. urticifolia. How-
ever, informations about other species are also
considered upon their availability in the literature.
For a comprehensive literature overview, we ana-
lyzed the published phytochemical and pharma-
cological data available through several search engines,
such as ®SciFinder, ISI ®Web of Science, ®Scopus and
®GoogleScholar, using ‘Agastache’ as the search key-
word. We disregarded publications pertaining to
agronomy, plant pathology, ecology andother unrelated
topics (unless any phytochemical or pharmacological
data were provided in them). In a few cases, we found
publications using bibliographical data from the refer-
ence lists of newer papers to verify the cited
information. Themajor portion of the retrieved citations
came fromyears following the previous review paper of
1998 (Fuentes-Granados et al. 1998).
Botanical description
The genus Agastache belongs to the Nepetoideae—a
subfamily of the Lamiaceae (Cantino et al. 1992).
The species of Agastache can be separated into two
sections: Brittonastrum and Agastache (Lint and
Epling 1945; Sanders 1987).
Plants from Agastache genus are perennial herbs,
reaching onemeter or more in height. The stems can be
simple or branched, erect or slightly creeping, andwith
an occasionally woody stem base. Their morphology is
typical for Lamiaceae, with opposite petiolate leaves, a
four-angled stem, numerous trichomes and labiate
flowers with pink, purple, white, yellowish or orange
corolla. The base chromosome number is 9. Agastache
species are native to North America, but one species
occurs naturally in East Asia (A. rugosa). Several
species are cultivated as ornamentals, with numerous
spectacular blooming cultivars. According to the
current listing by the taxonomical Internet database
lead by the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew and the
Missouri Botanical Garden (www.theplantlist.org—
accessed 31 December 2013), the genus Agastache
encompasses the following 29 accepted taxons:
A. aurantiaca (A.Gray) Lint & Epling
A. breviﬂora (A.Gray) Epling
A. cana (Hook.) Wooton & Standl.
A. coccinea (Greene) Lint & Epling

However, the number of Agastache species recog-
nized has not been constant, and several of them have
moved taxonomical positions throughout the years
(Lint and Epling 1945; Vogelmann 1985; Sanders
1987; Fuentes-Granados et al. 1998; RBG Kew—the
plant list web-based resource, accessed 31 December
2013). In 1945, 22 taxa of Agastache were reported
(Lint and Epling 1945), divided into two sections:
Brittonastrum and Chiastandra (synonymous with
currently recognized section Agastache). Brittona-
strum was described as native to the southwestern
United States and Mexico, while Chiastandra was
described in relation to the northern part of the United
States, Canada and East Asia (Lint and Epling 1945).
Later, one more species was recognized (A. eplingi-
ana) in an extensive taxonomic study of
Brittonastrum (Sanders 1987), two more were sepa-
rated from those already established (A. pallida and
A. mearnsii), and one species was divided into two
subspecies, with two or three varieties (A. pallidiﬂ-
ora: A. p. var. greenei and A. p. var. havardii).
In 1998, Fuentes-Granados et al. enumerated 22
species of the genus Agastache which had been
previously described (Lint and Epling 1945; Vogel-
mann 1985; Sanders 1987). The placing of a species
in either of the two sections is based chiefly on
differences in stamen length and arrangement.
Although the main criterion of the subgeneric parti-
tion seems to be clear-cut, the genetic relationships
between the species indicate more complexity (Lint
and Epling 1945). Furthermore, morphological sim-
ilarities between species of the same section do not
necessarily indicate close genetic affinity (Table 1).
Analysis of isoenzyme profiles and multivariate
morphological classification have demonstrated that
both morphological features and genetic distances
between species of both sections are not consistently
greater than within each section (Vogelmann 1985;
Sanders 1987). A. rugosa appeared to be more similar
to the eastern North-American populations than to the
western North-American populations of sect. Agas-
tache (Vogelmann and Gastony 1987). Moreover,
there is less intraspecific variation in the Agastache
section than in Brittonastrum (Lint and Epling 1945).
The morphology of leaf laminas as well as stem-
types and inflorescence were described in detail in
Fuentes-Granados et al.’s review (1998) and some
earlier papers (Lint and Epling 1945; Vogelmann
1985; Sanders 1987). Generally, the leaves of plants
from the Agastache section are longer (up to 15 cm)
than those of Brittonastrum (2–6 cm). Plants from the
Agastache section have ovate laminas with a crenate-
serrate leaf margin, whereas those of Brittonastrum
are more diverse. In the latter section, the basic leaf
form is cordate-triangular, but juvenile laminas are
ovate-to-cordate and mature—cordate, ovate, nar-
rowly ovate or oblong-linear. Leaf margins are
usually crenate, sometimes entire (Sanders 1987).
The stems of plants from the Agastache section are
simple or else branched with dense spicate inflores-
cences formed at terminal apices (Lint and Epling
1945). The inflorescence of Brittonastrum plants is
basically an elongate thyrse. However, in various
species and environmental conditions, it can be either
continuous and spike-like-to-brush-like or else dis-
continuous and moniliform-to-loosely ramified, with
a lower cymose clusters often remote from the upper
(Sanders 1987). However, the latter feature can also
appear in species from the Agastache section (Fuen-
tes-Granados et al. 1998).
The morphology of Agastache and Brittonastrum
flowers is also different (Sanders 1987). A typical
Agastache section corolla is asymmetrically and
narrowly funnel-formed, and slightly two-lipped.
Two adaxial lobes are fused for about two-thirds of
their length into a shallowly concave upper lip. Two
lateral lobes are much exceeded by the upper lip.
Four stamens are exserted from the tube and included
under the greatly exceeding upper corolla lip. The
dorsal pair of stamens is longer (didynamous). In
Brittonastrum, the corolla mouth is oblique with
small lobes (less than one-quarter of the entire corolla
length). The lateral lobes are fused more to the upper
lip than to the median lobe. Stamens are included
under or shortly exerted beyond the upper corolla lip.
From the several species considered here (A.
rugosa, A. foeniculum, A. urticifolia, A. scrophular-
iifolia, A. mexicana and A. nepetoides), only A.
mexicana is a member of the Brittonastrum section.
The morphological and chemical investigations of A.
mexicana suggested a new, white flowering taxon
named A. mexicana subsp. xolocotziana Bye, Linares
& Ramamoorthy (Bye et al. 1987). Hence, A.

mexicana has been placed into the nomotypical
subspecies A. mexicana subsp. mexicana. See also

chemical differences between these two subspecies.

Phytochemistry
Agastache species—typically for Lamiaceae—are
abundant in phenylpropanoid and terpenoid special-
ized metabolites. The first group includes flavonoids,
free phenolic acids and depsides as well as lignans.
The second major group—terpenoids are contained in
volatile fractions as well as in various organs as non-
volatiles. Most of the published studies focus on
essential oil analysis. There are also numerous papers
reporting the isolation and elucidation of the structure
of various phytochemicals.
Overview of extraction, analysis and purification
methods
Determination of volatile constituents:
● Essential oil hydrodistillation using Clevenger
apparatus or pharmacopoeia distillation apparatus
(Charles et al. 1991; Mazza and Kiehn 1992;
Svoboda et al. 1995; Dung et al. 1996; Tirillini
et al. 1997; Dapkevicius et al. 1998; Kim et al.
2001a; Maruyama et al. 2002; Shin and Kang
2003; Omidbaigi and Sefidkon 2003, 2004;
Estrada-Reyes et al. 2004; Mallavarapu et al.
2004; Shin and Pyun 2004; Bruni et al. 2007;
Omidbaigi et al. 2008; Tian et al. 2009; Ebadol-
lahi et al. 2010, 2011; Omidbaigi and Mahmoodi
2010; Skakovskii et al. 2010; Gong et al. 2012a,
b; Li et al. 2013);
● Essential oil distillation–extraction (Wang 2010);
● Extraction with organic solvents: hexane, hex-
ane–EtOAc mixtures, EtOAc, EtOAc–MeOH
mixtures, MeOH, dichloromethane (Kim et al.
2001b; Shin et al. 2001; Estrada-Reyes et al.
2004);
● Extraction with diethyl ether and boiling metha-
nol followed by cold storage (−20 °C) and steam
distillation (Weyerstahl et al. 1992);
● Headspace (Mazza and Kiehn 1992; Wilson et al.
1992; Zielinska et al. 2011);
● Glass microneedles used for the determination of
secretory trichomes constituents (Tirillini et al.
1997).
Determination of non-volatile compounds
Plant material, such as aerial parts, roots and cell,
tissue and organ cultures were extracted with various
organic solvents of different polarities applied either
independently or sequentially: n-hexane, petrol,
petroleum ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl
acetate, n-butanol, acetone, ethanol, methanol (two
latter solvents also mixed with water) or water alone.
Various extraction techniques were applied: macer-
ation at ambient or elevated temperature, reflux
extraction, infusions and decoctions in hot water.
The extracts were usually dried under reduced
pressure or by lyophilization (Itokawa et al. 1981;
Ganeva et al. 1994; Lee et al. 1995, 2002, 2007,
2008; Kim et al. 1999; Molina-Hernandez et al. 2000;
Suvitayavat et al. 2004; Vera-Montenegro et al. 2008;
Xu et al. 2008; Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2009, 2011,
2013; Gonzalez-Trujano et al. 2012).
A few additional methods were used in a compar-
ative study of the extraction of several herbs,
including A. foeniculum (Dapkevicius et al. 1998):
● Deodorized acetone extract obtained by re-
extracting all the dried solid retentate remaining
after hydrodistillation with acetone under contin-
uous shaking;
● Deodorized water extracts concentrated from the
liquid retentate remaining after hydrodistillation;
● Supercritical CO2 extracts;
● Acetone extracts;
● Methanol–water extracts obtained by re-extract-
ing the plant material remaining after the acetone
extraction.

The headspace volatile organic compounds and the
essential oil were usually analyzed using the gas
chromatography mass spectrometry technique (GC–
MS). For quantitative analysis, gas chromatography
was used with a flame ionization detector (GC–FID)
(Charles et al. 1991; Mazza and Kiehn 1992; Weyers-
tahl et al. 1992;Wilson et al. 1992; Svoboda et al. 1995;
Dung et al. 1996; Tirillini et al. 1997; Kim et al. 2001;
Estrada-Reyes et al. 2004; Mallavarapu et al. 2004;
Bruni et al. 2007; Mo et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2009;
Ebadollahi et al. 2010; Omidbaigi and Mahmoodi
2010;Wang 2010;Mo andMa2011;Gong et al. 2012a;
Li et al. 2013; Lim et al. 2013). Non-volatile analysis
was usually made with reversed phase HPLC using
C18 silica columns eluted with acetonitrile/water or
methanol/water mixtures, with photometric detection.
Individual isolated compounds were identified by
routine spectroscopic methods such as 1H and 13C
NMR, UV/VIS, infrared, and mass spectrometry (RA
—Kim et al. 1999; acacetin, tilianin, agastachoside,
linarin—Zakharova et al. 1980; thymol, myrcene,
limonene, β-caryophyllene, pulegone, menthone,
isomenthone, camphor, linalyl acetate, linalool, β-
phellandrene—Skakovskii et al. 2010; acacetin, tilia-
nin, isoagastachoside, agastachin—Itokawa et al.
1981; Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2009; agastinol, agaste-
nol—Lee et al. 2002, agastaquinone—Lee et al. 1995).
The compounds were mostly purified using col-
umn chromatography on silica gel eluted with various
solvents, sometimes preceded by liquid–liquid
extraction:
● Chloroform–methanol mixture, methanol–water
mixture, chloroform–methanol mixture, methanol
(RA—Kim et al. 1999; tilianin–Hong et al. 2001;
agastinol, agastenol—Lee et al. 2002);
● Petroleum ether-acetone mixture (estragole,
methyleugenol—Li et al. 2013);
● Ethyl acetate/n-hexane gradient n-hexane/chloro-
form/methanol (for the elution of fractions)
(agastaquinone—Lee et al. 1995);
● Hexane–ethyl acetate (l-pulegone—Maruyama
et al. 2002, Estrada-Reyes et al. 2004; estragole,
triterpenoids, flavonoids—Estrada-Reyes et al.
2004).
Further purification steps included column chro-
matography on different stationary phases, like C18
silica gel or Sephadex LH-20, sometimes finalized by
preparative reversed-phase HPLC (on C18 columns).
In bioactivity or environmental-screening studies,
simple colorimetric assays were used for the deter-
mination of the total content of certain metabolite
classes, like polyphenols (with a Folin-Ciocalteu
reagent), hydroxycinnamic acids (the European Phar-
macopoeia method) and flavonoids (with aluminum
chloride) (Suchorska-Tropiło and Pio´ro-Jabrucka
2004; Ibarra-Alvarado et al. 2010).
Essential oil composition
Typically for Nepetoideae, the volatiles produced by
Agastache plants are synthesized and stored in
glandular trichomes localized in crypts on the leaf
surface. These specialized morphological structures
appear during leaf development and are fully differ-
entiated in mature organs. Apart from the glandular
trichomes, the leaf lamina of different Agastache
species is more or less covered with non-secreting
hair. In some species, like A. foeniculum, the hair
cover is particularly dense (Svoboda et al. 1995).
Depending on the species and plant organ, the oil
yield can reach above 2 % (v/w) (the specific values
are given in Table 2) (Charles et al. 1991; Svoboda
et al. 1995; Omidbaigi and Sefidkon 2004; Omidbaigi
et al. 2008; Omidbaigi and Mahmoodi 2010). In most
of the studies the essential oil was obtained by the
hydro-distillation of aerial parts, either all together
(herb) or separated into leaves and inflorescences
(Charles et al. 1991, Svoboda et al. 1995; Dung et al.
1996, Omidbaigi and Sefidkon 2003, 2004; Mallav-
arapu et al. 2004; Omidbaigi et al. 2008; Ebadollahi
et al. 2010; Omidbaigi and Mahmoodi 2010; Gong
et al. 2012a, 2012b; Li et al. 2013).
The content of essential oil in the herb of different
Agastache species depends upon the time of harvest
as well as on the environmental conditions or
methods of cultivation (Omidbaigi and Mahmoodi
2010; Omidbaigi et al. 2008; Omidbaigi and Sefidkon
2004; Suchorska-Tropiło and Pio´ro-Jabrucka 2004;
Svoboda et al. 1995). For example, the highest oil
yield from A. mexicana, and A. rugosa was at the
beginning, whereas from A. foeniculum in the middle
of blooming period (Suchorska-Tropiło and Pio´ro-
Jabrucka 2004). A. rugosa and A. scrophulariifolia
grow well and give a higher yield of essential oil in
cooler summer temperatures. Conversely, A. foenic-
ulum and A. urticifolia prefer warmer conditions,
otherwise they do not bloom and produce only
396 Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416
123
negligible amounts of oil (Svoboda et al. 1995; Rudik
2013).
Moreover, plants from five Agastache species—A.
foeniculum, A. mexicana, A. rugosa, A. scrophularii-
folia, and A. urticifolia (Svoboda et al. 1995)—
produced significantly more essential oil during the
flowering phase than during vegetative growth. The
yield decreased again before senescence time.
The sowing time is also an important factor
influencing both the quantity and quality of essential
oil from A. foeniculum (Omidbaigi and Sefidkon
2004). Early sowing (March) was advantageous over
later months (May, July) resulting in higher yields
(2 %) and estragole content (92 %). The same
research group determined the positive effect of
nitrogen fertilization, which could improve the
essential oil yield by up to 2.88 % (at 100 kg N/
ha). The moderate irrigation of fields in the vicinity
of Tehran (Iran) was also beneficial (the highest yield
was ca. 2.3 %), but this treatment does not need to be
equally useful for areas with less arid conditions
during summer (Omidbaigi et al. 2008; Omidbaigi
and Mahmoodi 2010).
Although the composition of volatiles from the
Agastache species is relatively variable, some of the
constituents are usually predominating or else com-
prise a substantial fraction (Figs. 1, 2, 3). However,
there are some discrepancies in the results of
particular reports on several species as regards the
stability of composition and the influence of envi-
ronmental or hereditary factors.
Two main classes of volatile compounds are—
phenylpropanoids and terpenoids. The latter comprise
more abundant monoterpenes (hydrocarbons and
oxidized) and sesquiterpenes, usually present only
in small amounts.
Estragole confers the most typically-described
anise-like aroma to the plants and essential oils of
A. rugosa, A. foeniculum and A. mexicana (Fuentes-
Granados et al. 1998). Estragole (syn.: methyl
chavicol, p-allylanisol, 4-metoxyallylbenzene) is usu-
ally the most abundant constituent (18.6 % to over
98 %) in A. rugosa and A. foeniculum aerial parts
(Fujita and Fujita 1973; Charles et al. 1991, 1992;
Mazza and Kiehn 1992; Weyerstahl et al. 1992;
Wilson et al. 1992; Svoboda et al. 1995; Dung et al.

2004; Skakovskii et al. 2010; Wang 2010; Zielinska

other Agastache species (A. mexicana, A. mexicana
subsp. xolocotziana and A. scrophulariifolia) estrag-
ole was reported in various proportions (from absent
to over 86 %) (Svoboda et al. 1995; Estrada-Reyes
et al. 2004; Suchorska-Tropilo and Pio´ro-Jabrucka
2004). Other phenylpropene volatiles are also present
in varying amounts in Agastache. There are popula-
tions and individuals that are distinct in their essential
oil compositions from the most commonly described.
For example, the closest biosynthetic relative of
estragole—methyleugenol—was a main compound

(over 85 %) in some specimens from Japan (Fujita
and Fujita 1973), China (Li et al. 2013), and in
Korean accessions (Chae et al. 2005). The latter
authors suggest the existence of five chemotypes,
based on the analysis of specimens of various
geographical origins, cultivated in similar conditions:
1—the typical estragole-containing one (distributed
throughout the species range), and four others
(limited in their occurrence to one province)—with
major constituents of headspace volatiles being: 2—
menthone, 3—menthone and pulegone, 4—methyl-
eugenol, and 5—methyleugenol and limonene. In A.
rugosa, essential oil samples from Western China,
Gong et al. (2012a, b) reported large amounts (48.8
and 19.2 %) of p-menthan-3-one ((−)isomenthone),
estragole (20.8 and 29.5 %) and monoterpenes
(8.8 %). Estragole was not detected in the essential
oil of A. mexicana cultivars or A. scrophulariifolia,
while the samples were rich in pulegone, at 75.3 and
45.2 % respectively (Svoboda et al. 1995; Estrada-
Reyes et al. 2004). A. foeniculum can also contain up
to 19.6 % (E)-anethole, as the second most abundant
compound after estragole (59.5 %) in directly-sam-
pled (with microneedle) secretory trichomes (Tirillini
et al. 1992). However, anethole and other phenylall-
yls were usually detected in Agastache sp. only as
minor compounds (Fuentes-Granados et al. 1998;
Zielin´ska et al. 2011). In comparative analyses of 15
A. foeniculum populations, those of them with a low
estragole content were high in sesquiterpenoid spath-
ulenol (10.5–49.5 %) accompanied by various
amounts of bornyl acetate (Charles et al. 1991).
Moreover, these accessions also had a markedly
lower essential oil content (0.07–0.36 %) than
estragole-rich ones (0.80–2.45 %). The significance
of such relationships has not yet been clarified, but it
could relate to some environmental (rather than
hereditary) factors. Interestingly, sesquiterpenes (δ-
cadinol, β-caryophyllene and spathulenol) were also
predominant in A. nepetoides, analyzed during the
same study and likewise poor in essential oil
(0.18 %). One of the volatile monoterpenoids that is
produced in a higher proportion by different species
of Agastache is pulegone. It was reported in large
amounts in the essential oil of A. rugosa (13.4–
50.8 % (Svoboda et al. 1995; Maruyama et al. 2002;
Mo et al. 2009; Mo and Ma 2011), A. foeniculum
(22.6 %), A. scrophulariifolia (45.2 %) (Svoboda
et al. 1995) and A. mexicana subsp. xolocotziana
(80 %), but not in A. mexicana subsp. mexicana
(Estrada-Reyes et al. 2004).
Major volatiles are usually accompanied by less
abundantmonoterpenes (e.g., d-limonene, α-pinene, β-
pinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpineol, linalool, thymol,
menthofuran) and sesquiterpenes (e.g., β-caryophyl-
lene, carvacrol, germacrene B, germacrene D) (Polak
and Hixon 1945; Fujita and Fujita 1973; Charles et al.
1991; Mazza and Kiehn 1992; Weyerstahl et al. 1992;
Wilson et al. 1992; Tirillini et al. 1997;Maruyama et al.
2002; Omidbaigi and Sefidkon 2003; Mallavarapu
et al. 2004; Zielinska et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013).
Recently, several sesquiterpenoids (elixene, γ-muuro-
lene, viridiflorol, τ-muurolol), previously unknown
from this genus, have been reported in the essential oil
of A. rugosa aerial parts obtained by hydrodistillation
(Li et al. 2013). In a volatile fraction obtained by
simultaneous distillation–extraction,β-muurolenewas
present in a considerable amount, in 1.42 % of the total
volatile fraction (Wang 2010). The analysis of essen-
tial oils from the leaves and flowers ofA. foeniculum,A.
rugosa and putative hybrids between A. rugosa and A.
foeniculum was reported by Charles et al. (1991) who
examined 19 different accessions (11 of A. foeniculum,
four of A. rugosa and four of A. rugosa x A. foeniculum
putative hybrids). In seven samples from A. foenicu-
lum, neither menthone nor isomenthone were detected.
The other four contained a low percentage of isom-
enthone (0.14, 0.17, 0.88 and 1.12 %). By contrast,
isomenthone (0.31 % to 3.33 %) was present in A.
rugosa and putative hybrids between A. rugosa and A.
foeniculum. These hybrids were identified by the leaf
and inflorescence morphology (Charles et al. 1991).
However, in another study on four populations of A.
foeniculum, the content of isomenthone was more
diverse, ranging from 0 to 37.1 % (Svoboda et al.
1995).
Infection by the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)
caused alteration in the composition of A. foeniculum
essential oil (Bruni et al. 2007). The most significant
differences were observed in the content of estragole,
isomenthone, pulegone and limonene. The concen-
trations of limonene and isomenthone increased,
respectively, from 2.8 to 12.0 %, and from 27 to
43.9 %, whereas estragole and pulegone decreased
from 16.2 to 3.2 %, and from 31.2 to 18.7 %. A
significant quantitative decline of the oil yield
(3.5 ml/kg—healthy plants, 0.4 ml/kg—infected
plants) was also observed (Bruni et al. 2007).

Phenolic compounds
Caffeic acid derivatives—especially rosmarinic acid
and several glycosylated flavonoids are the most
abundant non-volatile phenolic metabolites in differ-
ent Agastache species (Fig. 4). The content of both
flavonoids and phenolic acids depends on the plant
organ and the ontogenetic phase, and also on external
factors such as biotic and abiotic stress and environ-
mental conditions.
Flavonoids
One of the typical flavones reported in Agastache is
an acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone)
glycoside—tilianin (acacetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyrano-
side) present in the aerial parts and roots of A.
rugosa and A. mexicana (Itokawa et al. 1981; Zou
and Cong 1991; Tuan et al. 2012; Hernandez-Abreu
et al. 2013). This compound appears to be more
representative for A. mexicana than for A. rugosa.
The content of tilianin in A. mexicana aerial parts
measured in various methanol extracts was over
8 mg/g of dried herb (Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2011).
A. rugosa contains much lower amounts of tilianin,
reaching 6.33 μg/g d.w. in flowers and even less in
other organs (2.18 μg/g in leaves, 0.49 μg/g in stems,
and 0.14 μg/g in roots) (Tuan et al. 2012). However,
Hong et al. (2001) were able to isolate almost 50 g of
pure tilianin from 30 kg of herb (yield of about

123
1.65 mg/g), which is still a significantly lower amount
compared to the yield of A. mexicana. Other flavo-
noids detected in these two species belonged mainly
to various subclasses of aglycones, such as hespere-
tin, apigenin, salvigenin, kaempferol and quercetin,
as well as (+)-catechin in A. mexicana (Estrada-
Reyes et al. 2004; Suchorska-Tropiło and Pio´ro-
Jabrucka 2004; Ibarra-Alvarado et al. 2010), while
apigenin, acacetin and 4′,5-dihydroxy-3,3′,7-trimeth-
oxyflavone were in A. rugosa (Zakharova et al. 1980;
Ishitsuka et al. 1982; Suchorska-Tropiło and Pio´ro-
Jabrucka 2004).
Glycosides other than tilianin were also obtained
from the aerial parts of A. rugosa: linarin (7-O-
rutinoside of acacetin) and agastachoside (6´´-O-
acetyl-7-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-5-hydroxy-4′-meth-
oxyflavone) (Zakharova et al. 1980). Itokawa et al.
(1981) were able to isolate not only two previously
described flavonoids—acacetin (285 mg from1 kg of
herb) and tilianin (46 mg), but also two new
compounds—210 mg of isoagastachoside (2´´-O-
acetyl-7-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-5-hydroxy-4′-meth-
oxyflavone) and 19 mg of a quite unique malonyl
diglucosylflavonoid, named ‘agastachin’ (di-(6´´-ac-
acetin-7-glucosyl) malonate). A. pallida (Lindl.) Cory
var. pallida (identified by the authors as A. barberi
(B.L. Rob.) Epling from Brittonastrum section, was
analyzed for surface flavonoids in a comparative
study of Nepeta sp. and related genera. In this plant,
four flavones were detected—luteolin, acacetin, cirsi-
maritin (5,4′-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone) and
isothymusin (5,8,4′-trihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflav-
one) (Jamzad et al. 2003). No quantitative data
were provided, however.
Different contents of flavonoids were observed in
the aerial parts of A. rugosa, A. mexicana, and A.
foeniculum, at three different times of harvest during
blooming (Suchorska-Tropiło and Pio´ro-Jabrucka
2004). A high content of flavonoids (apigenin,
quercetin) was observed at the beginning of the
flowering period or else at full bloom, while their
concentration declined as senescence set in. The
largest amount of apigenin (1.62 mg/g) was reported
for A. foeniculum and the smallest (0.17 mg/g) for A.
rugosa at the beginning of blooming. At full bloom,
there was also a significant amount of quercetin
(1.97 mg/g) in A. foeniculum. The content of total
hydroxycinnamic acids was not dependent on the
term of harvest.
Phenolic acids and lignans
While low concentrations of flavonoids like acacetin
and tilianin were reported in A. rugosa, RA content
observed during the same experiment was markedly
higher (Tuan et al. 2012). The highest amount of RA
was detected in flowers, where its content was
48.43 μg/g d.w., as well as in roots (30.97 μg/g)
and leaves (22.14 μg/g). The lowest content of RA
was reported in stems (9.14 μg/g). Janicsak et al.
(1999) compared rosmarinic and caffeic acid contents
in 96 Lamiaceae taxa, including three Agastache
species. The RA level was over four times higher
than that of caffeic acid in all three species, and was
as follows: A. mexicana—0.64 versus 0.15 mg/g, A.
urticifolia—0.30 versus 0.05 mg/g, and in A. foenic-
ulum—0.27 versus 0.06 mg/g of rosmarinic and
caffeic acids, respectively.
From the entire plant of A. rugosa, two lignans—
agastinol and agastenol—were isolated and charac-
terized (Lee et al. 2002). Both compounds are built of
three aromatic moieties (two phenylpropanoid and
one benzoyl) substituted by three hydroxy- and two
methoxy- groups in the same positions. Agastenol is
(7′R,8′S)-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-(hydroxy-3-meth-
oxybenzylidene)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)tet-
rahydrofuran-3-yl-methyl ester, whereas agastinol is
a derivative with a saturated bond between carbons 7
and 8—(8S,7′R,8′S)-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-(4-
hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methox-
yphenyl)tetrahydrofuran-3-yl-methyl ester.
Non-volatile terpenoids and sterols
From A. rugosa roots, several new diterpenoids
(examples in Fig. 5) were isolated and identified,
such as a red-colored nor-abietanoid agastaquinone
(Lee et al. 1995), and other oxidized abietanoids:
agastol, dehydroagastol, isoagastol (Han 1987; Zou
and Cong 1991), agastanone, and methylagastanol
(Han 1987; Lee et al. 1994).
A. rugosa roots also contain several pentacyclic
carboxylated and hydroxylated triterpenoids (Fig. 5)
of oleanane-type (maslinic acid, oleanolic acid, 3-O-
acetyl oleanolic aldehyde), ursane-type (corosolic
acid) and the sterols β-sitosterol and daucosterol (Han
1987; Zou and Cong 1991; Estrada-Reyes et al.
2004). An ursane-type structure was also represented
by ursolic acid isolated from aerial parts of A.
Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416 401
123
mexicana with a 0.33 % yield (Verano et al. 2013).
Both oleanane (β-amyrin) and ursane (α-amyrin)
triterpenoids were isolated from A. foeniculum aerial
parts, together with numerous sterols and stanols
(campesterol, campestanol, sitosterol, stigmasterol,
stigmastanol: Fig. 5) (Ganeva et al. 1994; Zou and
Cong 1991). Given the ubiquitous presence of both
pentacyclic triterpenoids and sterols in plants, they
can also be expected in other Agastache species, but
there are no qualitative or quantitative data available
so far.
The seed oil from A. rugosa studied for fatty acid
composition consisted of 91 % unsaturated fatty
acids, of which 52 % were C18:3 (linolenic acid),
27.5 % were C18:2 (linoleic acid) and 11.5 % were
monounsaturated C18:1 (oleic acid) acids (Zakharov
et al. 1988).
As in every green plant, several carotenoids are
also present in Agastache. Their quantitative analysis
was performed in A. foeniculum and A. rugosa by
means of RP-HPLC using a C30 column. β-Carotene
was the most abundant followed by xanthophylls—
lutein in amounts comparable to β-carotene and three
less abundant—zeaxanthin, violaxanthin and anther-
axanthin. A. rugosa contained larger amounts of each
detected carotenoid—499.2 versus 260.9 μg/g of β-
carotene and 277.1 versus 189.7 μg/g of lutein (Chae
et al. 2013).
Bioactivity of individual species as medicinal
plants
Of the three most important medicinal species, A.
rugosa is the main object in most of the published
bioactivity data (Table 3). A. rugosa is the only
species native to East Asia, and it is an important
herbal drug in Chinese, Korean and Japanese tradi-
tional medicine. As such, it has been frequently
studied for various pharmacological activities in both
in vitro and animal models.
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), there is
an ambiguity as to the identity of Agastache rugosa
as a herbal drug. The pinyin name—‘huoxiang’

(藿香)—meaning Agastachis herba, can refer either to
Agastache rugosa or to Pogostemon cablin (Blanco)
Benth. (as Pogostemonis herba, ‘Guang huoxiang’).
The latter herb, also known as ‘patchouli’, originates
from the south-east Asia (Malaysia and Indonesia), and
is commonly used as a substitute for Agastache rugosa
due to the similar functions defined by the TCM
(Holmes 1997; Chen et al. 2008). Similarly, in
traditional Japanese phytotherapy, both herbs are
utilized under the name ‘Kakko’ (Itokawa et al.
1981). In fact, the chemical composition (and typical
scent) of these plants is quite distinct (Holmes 1997;
Hu et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2013). According to TCM
theory, ‘huoxiang’ is classified among aromatic, damp-
dissolving herbs. It is said to dispel damp, release
‘exterior’ and ‘summer-damp’, relieve nausea and
vomiting, and cure fungal infections. The taste and
thermal properties of ‘huoxiang’ are pungent (acrid)
and slightly warm, and the channel affiliations enter
spleen, stomach and lung. The essential oil ofA. rugosa
is used against fever, headache, stomach pain, morning
sickness (combined with Scutellaria) and other gas-
trointestinal disorders (Dung et al. 1996; Lee et al.
2004; Hou and Jin 2005).
A. mexicana has been used in Mexican folk
medicine for the treatment of hypertension, stress
and anxiety (Cano Asseleih 1997; Ibarra-Alvarado
et al. 2010; Gonzalez-Trujano et al. 2012). Other
North American species are also used as botanical
drugs and food. Their usage by Native American
people was summarized in the previous review
(Fuentes-Granados et al. 1998). Briefly, most of
applications refer to both the aerial parts and roots of
A. foeniculum as a remedy against cough, fever and
heart conditions, as well as externally in treating
burns. Also, A. nepetoides leaves are used by Cayuga
externally for treating burns (from poison ivy) and
itching. Other folk medicinal species include: A.
urticifolia, used in Nevada against swelling, gastric
disorders and colds, A. pallidiﬂora used by the
Navajo for the treatment of coughs and fevers, and
A. scrophulariifolia roots, used by the Meskwaki as a
diuretic decoction.
Antimicrobial activity
Antimicrobial activity is among the most frequently
reported properties of essential oils from different
medicinal plants. Agastache is no exception. However,T

the strength of antibacterial and antifungal activity was
rather moderate in all the studied species.
Estragole isolated fromA. rugosawasmore efficient
against human pathogenic fungi as a pure compound
than as a crude essential oil. The antifungal activity of
estragole was proven against Aspergillus niger, A.
ﬂavus, Trichoderma viride,Candida albicans,C. utilis,
C. tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichophyton
mucoides, T. tonsurans, and Blastoschizomyces capit-
atus (Shin 2004; Shin and Kang 2003). The minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) obtained for purified
estragole was 2.5mg/ml for estragole and 5.0mg/ml or
more for the essential oil. These results are similar to
those obtained from other Lamiaceae species, like
Mentha spicata and Ocimum sanctum (MIC 2.5 and
5 % v/v, respectively), whereas the antimicrobial
activity of Cymbopogon sp. (Poaceae) essential oils
was reported to be approximately two orders of
magnitude higher (MIC at 0.06 %) (Bansod and Rai
2008).
Despite these barely noteworthy values, interesting
interactions were demonstrated between A. rugosa
essential oil and pure estragole and two reference
fungicidal antibiotics – the ketoconazole and ampho-
tericin B. FIC indexes with ketoconazole were 0.19
for estragole and 0.16 for A. rugosa oil against B.
capitatus, and 0.28–0.50 against Candida sp. (clearly
indicating a synergistic interaction). In contrast,
amphotericin B and estragole were antagonistic
against Candida sp. (Shin and Pyun 2004).
A. foeniculum essential oil tested against Aspergil-
lus sp. and Fusarium solani was markedly weaker
than Iranian thyme (Thymus kotschyanus) and garden
savory (Satureja hortensis) oils (Ownagh et al. 2010).
Agastache oil had detectable fungistatic activity only
at the highest concentrations—1 and 2 mg/ml,
whereas thyme and savory oils were fungicidal even
below 125 μg/ml. In brief, we can conclude that the
existing data are not in favor of popular claims about
the strong antimicrobial properties of essential oils
from either Agastache or other, related herbs.
Antiviral activity
4-Methoxycinnamaldehyde from A. rugosa essential
oil was reported to express antiviral activity against
the human respiratory syncytial virus (Wang et al.
2009). This compound effectively inhibited the
cytopathic effect of the respiratory syncytial virus
in a human larynx carcinoma cell line (IC50 of
0.055 μg/ml and a selectivity index of 898.2). It was
able to inhibit viral entrance by interfering with viral
attachment (IC50 of 0.06 μg/ml) and internalization
(IC50 of 0.01 μg/ml). Moreover, 4-methoxycinnam-
aldehyde at 0.1 μg/ml had a high cytoprotective rate
(90 %), while the same dose of Ribavirin (a prodrug
used as a control substance) saw no activity of this
kind. However, we must note that the 4-methoxycin-
namaldehyde used in this study was purchased from a
chemical company as a standard substance and was
not obtained from A. rugosa. The authors mention
this compound as an active principle of A. rugosa
essential oil. This assumption was based on indirect
citations from earlier publications, where phenyl-
propanoids such as estragole and cinnamaldehyde
derivatives were studies as attractants of rootworm
beetles (Metcalf and Lampman 1989). Hence, it is
hardly possible to conclude that essential oil form A.
rugosa can indeed become a practical source of this
antiviral compound. In our own research using the
GC–MS method on volatiles from this plant, 4-
methoxycinnamaldehyde was never detected (Zi-
elin´ska et al. 2011).
An efficient anti-picornavirus compound was iso-
lated from the leaves of A. rugosa. It was isolated and
investigated under the code name Ro-09-0179 by a
Japanese subsidiary of Roche (Ishitsuka et al. 1982).
Chemically, it is 4′,5-dihydroxy-3,3′,7-trimethoxyf-
lavone, also known as ‘pachypodol’, a tri-O-methyl
ether of quercetin. This highly lipophilic flavonol
selectively inhibited several human pathogenic RNA
viruses, such as rhinovirus, coxsackievirus and
poliovirus, acting on viral plus-strand RNA replica-
tion (at average MIC90 of 0.3 μg/ml) (Ishitsuka et al.
1982). It specifically targets the Golgi complex and
inhibits the processes associated with retrograde
transport (Sandoval and Carrasco 1997).
Whether or not this promising compound has real
therapeutic value and will be introduced as a drug or
lead structure cannot be predicted at the moment.
HIV is another RNA human virus targeted by A.
rugosa. Methanol extract, and from that isolated RA,
inhibited HIV integrase enzymatic activity in vitro
(IC50 of RA was 10 µg/ml) (Kim et al. 1999).
However, it is rather difficult to expect the actual
clinical relevance of RA as an anti-HIV compound.
Its common occurrence in various plants and broad
spectrum of activities renders it more of a model
Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416 405
123
structure for further experiments on antiviral mech-
anisms than as an applicable preventive phytophar-
maceutical.
Anti-mutagenic and cytotoxic properties
Essential oil from the flowers of A. rugosa was
reported to express anti-mutagenic activity in a dose-
dependent manner when tested in Chinese hamster
ovary AS52 cells. The AS52 cell line is a specially
designed, genetically engineered, hypermutating
in vitro system for testing mutations related to
oxidative stress. The crude oil was more active (14,
68 and 75 % inhibition of mutagenicity at concen-
trations 0.2, 0.6 and 1.0 g/l, respectively) than any of
the three individual components (estragole −11, 16
and 38 %; limonene 21, 30 and 43 %; anisaldehyde 8,
49 and 63 %). Interestingly, the less abundant
constituent of the oil—anisaldehyde was more potent
than the two major compounds, estragole and limo-
nene (Kim et al. 2001a). In the same study, the oil
was relatively less cytotoxic to human liver cell
cultures, and was inhibiting just below 12 % of the
untreated cell growth rate. On the other hand, a
prominent inhibition of cancer cell line growth was
observed, as well as the rapid augmentation of T and
B cells’ proliferation induced by the crude oil, which
was not obtained by any of the three individual
components. It is not possible to conclude from these
results whether a synergy exists between the three oil
components or whether the observed effects are
caused by other minor, more active compounds.
A cytotoxic effect towards several cancer lines
(lung, ovarian, melanoma, CNS and colon cancer)
was also demonstrated by agastaquinone—a non-
volatile diterpenoid from A. rugosa roots (Lee et al.
1995). The efficacy expressed as ED50 differed for
each cell line from 1.8 μg/ml (for neuronal cancer
cells) to 12.8 μg/ml, whereas cis-platin ED50 was
0.5–1.0 μg/ml.
Interestingly, two lignans from the same plant—
agastinol and agastenol—caused quite different
effects in leukemia cells U937, in which protection
against etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed
(Lee et al. 2002). Agastenol activity was close to the
standard anti-apoptotic agent—pyrrolidine dithiocar-
bamate (IC50 11.4 μg/ml and 8.3 μg/ml, respectively)
—whereas agastinol was considerably less effective
(IC50 15.2 μg/ml). Although anti-apoptotic activity
had been tested on a malignant cell line, it should be
explored further as being potentially useful in
degenerative and aging-related disorders.
The above results indicate the very promising
potential of A. rugosa constituents in chemopreven-
tion, which was demonstrated by in vitro cell-based
assays. However, more investigations (including
in vivo ones) are needed to confirm such properties.
In particular, some minor but more active compounds
from both essential oil and non-volatile fractions
should be considered.
Antioxidant activity
Given the significance of Agastache sp. in traditional
phytotherapy and economic botany in different
regions, one might expect at least several papers
describing a once very fashionable antioxidant activ-
ity. Quite surprisingly, unlike for many other related
food and medicinal plants, little has been published
about it.
Certainly, it can be assumed that the content of
such potent antioxidants as RA and polyhydroxylated
flavonoids should contribute to this type of activity.
In this regard, a comparative mechanistic study using
at least several complementary assays would be of
particular interest. It should encompass different
Agastache species and compounds isolated from
them, followed by an attempt to elucidate the role
of the individual constituents in the extracts’
properties.
In one of the few in vivo studies that have been
published so far, a TCM preparation containing
essential oil from A. rugosa was remarkably efficient
in alleviating heat stress symptoms. In pigs kept at
40 °C, the herbal treatment reduced the malonyldi-
aldehyde level and restored SOD and GPx activity to
the control level. In a cell culture experiment
involving separated components of the TCM prepa-
ration, the essential oil of A. rugosa herb was among
the most efficient agents (at 100 and 200 μg/ml) in
improving antioxidant status after heat stress, but the
differences were not significant (Guo et al. 2011).
Another in vitro cell-based system in which A. rugosa
has been improving an antioxidant marker is the
standard monocyte/macrophage line RAW264.7 (Oh
et al. 2006). Here, a concentrated decoction (hot
water extract, lyophilized and dissolved at 28 %
concentration) efficiently induced the expression of
406 Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416
123
HO-1—one of the isoforms of heme oxygenase (HO).
This effect was concomitant with decreased hydrogen
peroxide cytotoxicity upon A. rugosa extract treat-
ment. The suggested mechanism involves the protein
kinase G pathway, evidenced by the use of PKG
inhibitors, which partially counteracted the A. rugosa
extract’s cytoprotective activity. However, the con-
tribution of direct H2O2 scavenging is also possible.
Unfortunately, nothing is known about the particular
extract constituents that may be responsible for this
effect. According to Oh et al. (2006), it could be
attributed to tilianin, but the authors did not check its
content nor did they perform any standardization of
the extract. Water extraction would most likely yield
other phenolic compounds, such as caffeic acid
derivatives, which could contribute to both direct
antioxidant and heme oxygenase-activating mecha-
nisms. The ability to scavenge reactive oxygen
species—such as hydroxyl radicals—was also dem-
onstrated in a screening study of 25 traditional
Chinese herbs, among which a tincture (ethanol
macerate) from Agastachis herba was moderately
active with an EC50 of 4.4 µg/ml (Wang et al. 2006).
Interestingly, Agastache extract was least reactive in
a total polyphenol test (29.3 mg/g gallic acid
equivalents) of those with an EC50 was below
10 µg/ml. Bearing in mind the inaccuracy of a ‘total
content of…’ approach in bioactivity studies, it can
be speculated that, in A. rugosa, there are other
compounds at work, not just Folin-Ciocalteu reagent-
reducing agents.
Cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory effects
Tilianin is frequently regarded as a major bioactive
compound, especially in two of the most popular
species—A. rugosa and A. mexicana. Some studies
have been performed using isolated tilianin, whereas
in others it was a phytochemical marker in various
extracts or fractions.
Both tilianin and extract from A. rugosa had a
positive effect on the early stages of atherosclerosis
pathophysiology (Hong et al. 2001). In experiments
with mice on a high cholesterol diet, addition of 1 %
of A. rugosa methanol extract reduced the total
plasma cholesterol levels (from 1065 mg/dl down to
986 mg/dl). The cholesterol content of VLDL was
lower, too, but the change was not statistically
significant (Hong et al. 2001).
Treatment with tilianin (0.05 % in the diet)
resulted in the reduction (to 56.6 %) of the lesion
area in the aortic sinuses of hyperlipidemic mice.
However, the results showed no significant differ-
ences between tilianin treatment and a high
cholesterol diet for the tested groups in terms of total
cholesterol and HDL levels. Also, the triglyceride
content was lower after tilianin supplementation in
the tested groups of animals, although the results
were not statistically significant (Nam et al. 2005).
However, pretreatment with tilianin significantly
suppressed (80 and 74 % at 10 and 100 μmol,
respectively) the TNF-α-induced expression of vas-
cular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Hong et al.
2001). In murine peritoneal macrophages, tilianin
inhibited NF-κB activation in a concentration-depen-
dent manner (1–10 μmol), causing a decrease of pro-
inflammatory cytokines’ (TNF-α and IL-1β) mRNA
levels (Nam et al. 2005).
Tilianin was also obtained from A. mexicana,
which is actually a more abundant source of it. The
antihypertensive properties of A. mexicana used in
folk herbal medicine in Mexico are attributed to
tilianin content (Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2009). In a
comparative study of various solvent extracts pre-
pared from herbs dried at different temperatures,
vasorelaxant ex vivo activity correlated with the
amount of tilianin (Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2011).
However, the tilianin potency in relaxing rat aortic
contractions was significantly weaker than the refer-
ence drug carbachol (EC50 104 µg/ml and 0.075 µg/
ml, respectively).
The mechanisms of hypotensive and vasorelaxant
properties involve the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway and
potassium channel (Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2009). A
hypotensive effect on both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure was confirmed in vivo using a spontaneously
hypertensive rat model in which the ED50 was
53.51 mg/kg body weight (compared to captopril
30 mg/kg) (Hernandez-Abreu et al. 2013). In the same
study, no toxicity was found in the mouse model up to
the dose of 1 g/kg, whichwarrants further investigation
at the clinical level. However, the overall efficacy of
using A. mexicana as an anti-hypertensive remedy can
be disputed, as demonstrated by the study of aqueous
decoctions from10 herbs (Ibarra-Alvarado et al. 2010).
Of the seven herbs that evoked relaxation, A. mexicana
extract was the second weakest (24.9 % relaxation of
Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416 407
123
pre-contracted rat aortic segments), whereas four of
them (Psittacanthus calyculatus, Dracocephalum mol-
davica,Prunus serotina,Chiranthodendron pentadact-
ylon) reached more than 60 % (Ibarra-Alvarado et al.
2010). This result actually agreeswith those previously
mentioned, where aqueous extracts were poor in
tilianin. Thus, the most popular method for preparing
herbal tea is rather unlikely to be efficient against
cardiovascular conditions.
Neurological activities
Three different solvent extracts of A. mexicana subsp.
xolocotziana exhibited anti-nociceptive activity, dem-
onstrated in an animal study using rats and mice
(Gonzalez-Trujano et al. 2012; Gonzalez-Ramirez
et al. 2012). In a set of complementary tests, hexane,
ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from macerated
inflorescences were compared. As a result, all the
extracts diminished nociception in experimental ani-
mals. Differences in the extracts’ polarities were
reflected by their composition and the kind of induced
pain that was reduced in each test. Ethyl acetate extract
(containing significant amounts of ursolic acid)was the
most efficient in reducing behavioral responses to pain
induced by formalin, especially in the inflammatory
(second) phase, while hexane extract (non-polar com-
pounds, like pulegone and oleanolic acid) decreased
reactions to heat-induced pain. However, the inflam-
mation symptoms caused by formalin were inhibited
mainly bymethanol extract, which is rich in flavonoids
such as acacetin and tilianin. Acacetin, present in
methanol extract (14.9 mg/g), showed the highest anti-
nociceptive activity (ED50 of 2 mg/kg) while that for
diclofenac was 12 mg/kg and that for ursolic acid was
3 mg/kg. Spasmolytic response was also observed for
acacetin at a concentration of 3.5 µmol. Furthermore,
the same papers report a lack of gastric toxicity with
high doses (1 g/kg body weight) of extracts. The same
extracts protected gastric mucosa against lesions
caused by the oral administration of absolute ethanol.
This study suggests a possible application of a complex
preparation from this herb in alleviating various pain-
causing disorders, and confirms the typical ethnome-
dicinal use of A. mexicana in such conditions.
Likewise, (R)-(+)-pulegone from the essential oil
of A. rugosa (syn. A. formosana) also exhibited anti-
nociceptive activity against heat- and chemically-
induced pain in mice, as well as CNS-depressing and
anticonvulsant effects (de Sousa et al. 2011). It is not
known what the cellular mechanisms of such activity
are, but some structural resemblance to menthol (a
widely-used monoterpene targeting several mediators
in pain receptors, including kappa-opioid) could
guide further research into pulegone and Agastache
essential oil (Kamatou et al. 2013).
The aqueous extract of A. mexicana leaves exhib-
ited antidepressant-like activity (Molina-Hernandez
et al. 2000). The results of three different tests (an
Elevated plus-maze test, a forced swimming test and
an open field test) revealed the anxiogenic-like effect
of A. mexicana extract rather than anxiolytic-like
activity. In the elevated plus-maze test, A. mexicana
water extract reduced open-arms exploration; the
results of the forced swimming test also showed no
antidepressant-like effect of the extract (12.0 mg/kg
body wt.), tested on rats’ behavior using pentylen-
etetrazole (15 mg/kg body wt.) and desipramine
(32 mg/kg body wt.) as control substances. However,
when it was administrated together with desipramine,
it increased the antidepressant-like effect of the latter,
similar to the effect of pentylenetetrazole and desi-
pramine co-administration. The open field test
revealed no sedative effect of water extract of A.
mexicana at the doses used. Again, the study is in
partial agreement with traditional folk indications for
this plant, but it also argues against its uncritical use
as an anxiolytic remedy.
Biocidal activity
Somehow distinct from above described pharmaco-
logical and preventive properties are the pesticidal
activities of various substances from the Agastache
species. Some of the results presented below indicate
the real applicative potential of as environmentally
friendly, biodegradable crop- and foodstuff-protec-
tion products.
A. rugosa methanol extract obtained by maceration
exhibits insecticidal activity against stored products
pests, such as the beetle species Lasioderma serri-
corne (infesting tobacco products) (Kim et al. 2003a)
as well as Sitophilus oryzae (rice weevil) and
Callosobruchus chinensis (bean weevil) (Kim et al.
2003b).
The insecticidal properties against various stored
product-infesting beetles were also evidenced by A.
foeniculum essential oil. The pests efficiently targeted
408 Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416
123
by estragole and 1,8-cineole-rich oil included: L.
serricorne (saw-toothed grain beetle), Oryzaephilus
surinamensis L. (a major pest of oilseeds, such as
nuts, sunflowers and other foodstuffs), the red flour
beetle (attacking mainly ground starch materials)
Tribolium castaneum Herbst, and the lesser grain
borer Rhyzopertha dominica F. (a pest of cereal
grains) (Ebadollahi 2011; Ebadollahi et al. 2010,
2013). A. rugosa has also been suggested as one of
the plants that may serve as an alternative source of
mite control fumigants for Dermanyssus gallinae De
Geer, an important blood-sucking poultry ectopara-
site causing losses in flocks of egg-laying hens (Kim
et al. 2007).
A. rugosa essential oil was also efficient in killing
Meloidogyne incognita—a root-knot nematode. How-
ever, the tested plant represented a chemotype with
over 50 % methyleugenol and just 8.55 % estragole
(Li et al. 2013). Weak nematicidal activity was also
exhibited by A. rugosa essential oil against the
Pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus
(Andres et al. 2012). A. mexicana methanol extract
tested against parasitic flatworm (Fasciola hepatica)
in a screening study on 19 herbal species from
Mexico did not show any fasciolicide properties
(Vera-Montenegro et al. 2008). With regard to crop
protection, even the attractant properties of estragole
and other phenylpropanoids from Agastache, could
be utilized as semiochemical bait ingredients for
controlling diabroticide rootworm beetles (Metcalf
and Lampman 1989).
Herbal drug formulae
‘Huoxiang’ (Agastachis herba) is one of the 50
fundamental herbs used in TCM. It can be utilized as
a single drug or as an ingredient in the multicompo-
nent formulations most commonly used by TCM and
other East Asian traditional phytotherapy systems
(Table 4).
One noteworthy example of a multidrug formula
containing A. rugosa is Gan-lu-xiao-du-dan, used in
chronic hepatitis. This drug, consisting of 10 herbs,
has been among the 10 most popular traditional
Chinese medicines prescribed in Taiwan for hepatitis
(Chen et al. 2008).
Another example of a Chinese patent medicine
containingA. rugosa leafwater extract isQiweiBaizhu
Powder (QWBZP). Other ingredients in QWBZP
include the roots of Panax ginseng, Atractylodes
macrocephala, Pueraria lobata, Saussurea costus,
Glycyrrhiza uralensis and a mushroom—Poria cocos
(Wu et al. 2010). This herbal preparation is effective
against HRV (human rotavirus) infection and has been
studied in baby mice who suffered from diarrhea. In
this study, QWBZP extract stimulated the gene tran-
scription of several interleukins and IFN-γ in intestinal
mucosa epithelial cells, as well as modulated CD8 T
cell subset density. The effect of the preparation was
comparable to the standard antiviral drug Ribavirin.
There is also a traditional Korean formula—called
‘Sopoongsan’—which contains A. rugosa among 12
ingredients. Sopoongsan is composed of water or

ethanol extracts from various plant species (besides
A. rugosa, these are Nepeta japonica, Glycyrrhiza
uralensis, Panax ginseng, Cnidium ofﬁcinale, Peuce-
danum japonicum, Dendrobium nobile, Angelica
koreana, Citrus unshiu, Magnolia ofﬁcinalis), one
mushroom species (Poria cocos) and one insect
species—silk moth (Bombyx mori). This oriental
medicinal prescription has been reported to exhibit
anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-allergy and
anticancer activity on human skin (Lee et al. 2007).
In Thailand, one of the folk herbal drug formulae
used for the treatment of stomach discomfort is Ya-
hom. It contains the entire plant of A. rugosa among
16 other plant substances (Suvitayavat et al. 2004).
The ability of this formula to inhibit gastric acid
secretion was evidenced in rats treated with histamine
or carbachol (a synthetic acetylcholine derivative).
Ya-hom treatment decreased pepsin and protein
secretory rates and inhibited histamine-induced gas-
tric mucosal blood flow. The effect was observed in a
time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Ya-
hom enhanced visible gastric mucus secretion. The
above effects support the use of this preparation
against stomach discomfort (Suvitayavat et al. 2004).
The research on composite preparations is not as
advanced as on individual herbs or phytochemicals,
due to its complexity and difficulties in reliable data
analysis. However, the results obtained to date
suggest the important contribution of A. rugosa to
therapeutic properties of such preparations widely
used in Asian phytomedicine.
Biosynthesis of active compounds
The molecular level of the biosynthesis of specialized
metabolites of Agastache has so far been considered
in only two published articles, both using A. rugosa.
The earlier one (Maruyama et al. 2002) reported
cloning and the functional expression of an enzyme
responsible for the production of a monoterpene
(limonene), while the more recent one (Tuan et al.
2012) described the expression of several key genes
for early, committed steps of the biosynthesis of
phenolic compounds.
The d-Limonene synthase gene from A. rugosa
was cloned using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
based on the highly conserved sequences among
terpene synthases (TSs) (Maruyama et al. 2002).
Most of the synthase genes that had previously been
discovered in various species of the Lamiaceae
family encoded for the l-limonene synthases, and
only one—from Schizonepeta tenuifolia—for the d-
enantiomer (Maruyama et al. 2002). A. rugosa is a
proper model for the characterization of d-limonene
synthase, since the plant produces d-limonene and its
downstream biosynthetic derivatives l-pulegone and
l-isomenthone. The complete A. rugosa limonene
synthase gene (Ar-lms) is a sequence of 2,077
nucleotides, and contains a 1,839 bp translated region
encoding 613 amino acids. The deduced amino acid
sequence contains a putative plastid-targeting frag-
ment at its N-terminus. The recombinant A. rugosa
limonene synthase gene was functionally expressed
using an in vitro cell free-transcription/translation
system. The recombinant protein yielded d-limonene
as a single product of the enzymatic reaction from
GPP (geranyl pyrophosphate). A. rugosa limonene
synthase showed a high homology to the synthases
(d- and l-limonene synthases) of closely-related
species from the same plant family, indicating only
a few amino acids’ residues that are the responsible
for the stereochemistry of the enzyme. The highest
homology (87.3 %) was found with the d-limonene
synthase from Schizonepeta tenuifolia, and the
molecular weight (60 kDa) of both proteins was
identical. The deduced amino acid sequence of the d-
limonene synthase gene from A. rugosa, exhibits a
relatively high homology to the l-limonene synthase
of other Lamiaceae species, such as: Mentha spicata
(70.8 %), M. longifolia (70.6 %), Perilla frutescens
(62.8 %) and P. citriodora (62.7 %). The comparison
between d- and l-limonene synthase amino acid
sequences from several Lamiaceae species indicated
11 amino acid residues (four aromatic and seven
acidic) as candidates for controlling the stereospec-
ificity of the enzymatic reactions. The transcription of
the genes involved in the early steps of phenylprop-
anoid biosynthesis was examined in A. rugosa using
quantitative real-time PCR (Tuan et al. 2012). The
expression patterns of these enzymes (phenylalanine
ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase
(C4H), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone
synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI)) were
correlated to the RA and tilianin contents in different
organs.
The cDNA of two genes encoding the enzymes
(chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase) involved
410 Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416
123
in the biosynthesis of tilianin in A. rugosa were also
isolated and characterized (Tuan et al. 2012). CHS
and CHI have demonstrated a high homology with
respect to the enzymes of other species. For instance,
the A. rugosa CHS amino acid sequence has a 95 %
identity and 98 % similarity with Perilla frutescens
CHS (Lamiaceae), a 95 % identity and 98 %
similarity with Solenostemon scutellarioides CHS
(Lamiaceae), a 93 % identity and 96 % similarity
with Misopates orontium CHS (Plantaginaceae), and
a 92 % identity and 96 % similarity with Mazus
pumilus CHS (Phrymaceae). The results of homology
analysis indicated four A. rugosa amino acid residues
defined for the active sites (Cys 164, Phe 215, His
303 and Asn 336) that are conserved in all the
identified chalcone synthases. The A. rugosa chal-
cone isomerase was highly homologous to Perilla
frutescens CHI (79 % identity and 88 % similarity),
Scutellaria baicalensis CHI—Lamiaceae (78 and
89 % similarity), Camelia sinensis CHI—Theaceae
(75 % identity and 88 % similarity), and Dianthus
caryophyllus CHI—Caryophyllaceae (74 % identity
and 87 % similarity). In the A. rugosa CHI, four
residues were found (Thr 60, Tyr 118, Asn 125 and
Ser 202) that had already been known as active sites
of chalcone isomerases.
The comparative analysis of the gene transcription
level of biosynthetic enzymes and the content of
secondary metabolites (acacetin, tilianin and RA)
showed the constitutive expression of the genes in all
organs. The highest transcript levels of ArPAL and
Ar4CL were found in leaves, whereas ArC4H, ArCHS
and ArCHI reached their highest expression in
flowers. In roots, all five genes were expressed at a
relatively low level (Tuan et al. 2012). These results
reveal a complex regulation mechanism of the
biosynthesis of A. rugosa flavonoids (acacetin, tilia-
nin) and RA. The highest expression (= transcript
accumulation) of A. rugosa PAL and 4CL in leaves as
well as C4H in flowers corresponded to a relatively
high content of RA in those plant organs. Yet, a
significant amount of RA was present in the roots,
where the transcript levels of PAL, C4H and 4CL
were low. Mechanisms for the allocation of specific
metabolites and metabolite fluxes within the plant
body require more studies, which should focus
especially on more downstream biosynthetic enzymes
and genes, as well as on possible transport between
tissues and organs.
Agastache in in vitro cultures and the production
of secondary metabolites
Plant in vitro cultures have been applied mainly to A.
rugosa and only rarely to other species (two reports
on A. foeniculum) for such purposes as micropropa-
gation (Mazur and Reshetnikov 2005; Kayani et al.
2013; Zielin´ska et al. 2011) and as a model system for
studying the biosynthesis regulation of volatile
(Menghini et al. 1992; Shin et al. 2001; Zielin´ska
et al. 2011) and non-volatile specialized metabolites,
as well as the efficient production of desired
compounds such as RA (Mazur et al. 2008; Xu
et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2013).
Different organ and tissue cultures were initiated,
including callus from various explants, suspension
cell cultures and organs (shoots and roots). Hairy
roots were also induced by transformation with
Agrobacterium rhizogenes.
For the in vitro shoot multiplication of A. rugosa,
6-bezylaminopurine was the favored cytokinin for
inducing a morphogenetic response, and stem nodal
segments were the optimal explants for forming
multiple shoots (Mazur and Reshetnikov 2005;
Zielin´ska et al. 2011). Furthermore, the total shoot
number per explant was higher when the proliferation
medium was supplemented with a natural auxin
(indole-3-acetic acid) rather than a synthetic auxinic
herbicide (picloram) (Zielin´ska et al. 2011).
A micropropagation protocol using shoot multi-
plication from nodal explants, followed by rooting
and acclimation, was also established for A. foenic-
ulum (syn. A. anisata) (Kayani et al. 2013). As with
A. rugosa, the best performance (eight shoots per
explant) was achieved on a BA- and IAA-supple-
mented MS medium. Great diversity was observed in
the headspace volatile metabolites’ profiles in A.
rugosa shoot cultures (Zielin´ska et al. 2011). The
composition of the volatiles emitted from the shoots
growing on media supplemented with exogenous
plant growth regulators was significantly different
from the intact plant phytochemical profile. Under
in vitro conditions, monoterpenes such as limonene,
pulegone, menthone and isomenthone predominated,
whereas estragole was present only in trace amounts.
The estragole content in in vitro-germinated seed-
lings and intact plants was significantly higher (21
and 95 %, respectively). On the other hand, the
content of individual monoterpenes also varied
Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416 411
123
between different hormonal treatments. For example,
pulegone constituted 12.2–92.7 % of the total head-
space volatiles analyzed by SPME–GC–MS,
isomenthone from 0.1 to 26.4 %, and α-pinene
(which was absent from conventionally grown plants)
from 1.6 to 25.9 %. These results show that in vitro
conditions can greatly influence the proportions
between phenylallyls and monoterpenes, as well as
between different monoterpenes (Zielinska et al.
2011). In contrast, the shoot cultures of A. foeniculum
produced mainly estragole but only traces of another
volatile phenylpropanoid—trans-anethole. The cul-
ture media’s supplementation with the precursor of a
general phenylpropanoid pathway—shikimic acid—
enhanced the concentration of methyl chavicol, and
several pigments (i.e., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b
and carotenoids). No direct correlation between
estragole content and pigment concentration was
observed (Menghini et al. 1992).
In a suspension cell culture of A. rugosa initiated
from a leaf-derived callus maintained in the dark,
hydrocarbons and sesquiterpenes were mostly iden-
tified, whereas elicitation with methyl jasmonate or
jasmonic acid (both at 100 µM) and illumination with
white light resulted in more monoterpenes and a low
amount of estragole (0.58 %) (Shin et al. 2001). The
results of another study (Kim et al. 2001b) also show
that non-differentiated cells differ in the volatile
metabolite production profile. In the suspension
cultures also obtained from leaf calluses,
3-hydroxy-2-butanone was the most abundant com-
pound, followed by 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-oxazoline,
1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 1,3-butanediol. Estragole
and other typical compounds of the species were not
detected. In plants regenerated via in vitro cultures,
the content of secondary metabolites (such as total
phenolics, flavonoids, acacetin and tannins) also
deviated from conventionally grown plants (Mazur
et al. 2008).
A. rugosa suspension cultures maintained on
media containing 2,4-D (0.5 mg/l) and kinetin
(0.1 mg/l) produced only low amounts of RA (Kim
et al. 2001c). The highest content of RA (slightly
exceeding 0.4 mg/g d.w.) was obtained on the
eighteenth day during the stationary phase of the
culture in the cells, but not in the culture medium.
Better results for RA production in suspension
cultures of A. rugosa were obtained by treatment
with benzothiadiazole combined with a yeast elicitor.
The experiments with elicitation enhanced the pro-
duction of RA in the suspension cells by a factor of
11.4, but the maximum content of this compound
reached only 5 mg/g of dry weight. The benzothia-
diazole alone had no effect on RA production.
However, in later experiments similar suspension
cultures were able to accumulate much higher
quantities of RA. The best cell growth (7.0 g/l) and
RA production (10.7 mg/g d.w.) were observed on a
MS medium supplemented with BAP (0.1 mg/l) and
with 2,4-D (2 mg/l). A slightly higher content for the
RA (11.5 mg/g d.w.) was achieved after culturing the
suspension cells on B5 (Xu et al. 2008).
In the most recent report, the elicitation of cell
cultures with methyl jasmonate (50 µM) resulted in a
more than five-times higher accumulation of RA, up
to 36.58 mg/g (Kim et al. 2013), which was similar to
the value obtained—for example—in Lavandula vera
(33.2 g/l d.w.) (Georgiev et al. 2004).
A metabolomic and transcript analysis of the key
biosynthetic genes encoding the enzymes for early
committed steps in phenylpropanoid metabolism,
such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase (ArPAL),
cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (ArC4H), and 4-coumarate:
coenzyme-A (CoA) ligase (Ar4CL), was published
recently by Kim et al. (2013). The experiment using
A. rugosa cell cultures elicited with methyl jasmonate
demonstrated that both phenolic acids (p-coumaric,
p-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic, rosmarinic) and precur-
sors for the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway
(such as aromatic amino acids and shikimate) were
induced as a response to MeJA treatment. The
increased RA accumulation in the elicited cells might
be due to the activation of the phenylpropanoid genes
ArPAL, ArC4H and Ar4CL, whose transcripts were
increased by a factor of 9.2, 7.8 and 7.4, respectively
(Kim et al. 2013). Hairy roots were induced by the
infection of the leaves and stem sections of A. rugosa
with the Agrobacterium rhizogenes B1000 strain. The
maximum biomass growth of 14.1 g/l in a basal liquid
MS medium was achieved after 2 weeks of culture. In
the hairy root cultures, the RA content reached
116.3 mg/g dry weight after 14 days of culture (Lee
et al. 2008). It was significantly higher than the best
results obtained from cell cultures and the roots of A.
rugosa. The efficiency of this system is comparable
to other representatives from Lamiaceae, like Hyss-
opus ofﬁcinalis, Ocimum basilicum, Salvia
miltiorrhiza and S. ofﬁcinalis, usually reaching
412 Phytochem Rev (2014) 13:391–416
123
between 5 and 15 % of dry weight (reviewed by Park
et al. 2008).
Closing remarks and future outlook
All the above-mentioned findings suggest the impor-
tance of A. rugosa for East Asian traditional medicine,
which can be expected to extend to other regions,
similar to the already more popular herbs from
Lamiaceae. Two American species—currently more
common as ornamentals—should also be considered as
prospective phytomedicines. For this to occur, more
research is needed, both on whole crude drugs and on
purified fractions and individual compounds.
The role of individual components in the determi-
nation of medicinal properties is yet to be elucidated
and the mechanisms of action verified. This also
applies to multi-herb formulas (most commonly
administered in traditional medicine) in order to
understand the contribution of each constituent as
well as any potentially synergistic or additive
relationships.
Another question concerns how genetic diversity,
already existing in the form of many ornamental
varieties, affects phytochemical composition and
medicinal properties, as exemplified by the case of
A. mexicana subspecies (Estrada-Reyes et al. 2004).
Issues relating to the diversity and variability of
essential oil composition and yield must be resolved
as a prerequisite for proper quality management and
standardization procedures. In this respect, the bio-
technological approach may become the appropriate
solution. It applies equally to the composition of non-
volatile phytochemicals, such as tilianin and other
flavones, phenolic acids, rare diterpenoids and trit-
erpenoids. The latter two groups—except for ursolic
acid—have not been sufficiently studied in terms of
their bioactivity or the possibility of obtaining
applicable amounts for pharmaceutical use. These
compounds are also promising as biological pesti-
cides, especially in the protection of stored crops
attacked by pest invertebrates.
In the near future, we will most likely witness a
flurry of publications dealing with various aspects of
bioactivity and molecular phytochemistry in Agas-
tache. We hope that this review will inspire more
researchers to consider those beautiful and healthy
plants worth studying, as well as funding agencies in
supporting such research.
