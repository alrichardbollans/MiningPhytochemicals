Additionally, we also consulted some books on Chinese medicine.Results: To date, 227 secondary metabolites have been isolated from H.sampsonii, including polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs),benzophenones, xanthones, flavonoids, naphthodianthrones, anthraquinonesand aromatic compounds. These metabolites exhibit various biologicalactivities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-depressant, anti-oxidant,anti-viral and anti-bacterial effects. PPAPs are considered the main activemetabolites with rich biological activities. Despite being known as rich sourceof PPAPs, the full extent of H. sampsonii biological activities, including theirpotential as PDE4 inhibitors, remained unclear. Since, previous studies havemainly been based on structural identification of metabolites in H. sampsonii,and efficacy evaluations of these metabolites based on clinical applications of H.sampsonii lack sufficient data. However, current evidence suggest that PPAPs arethemost likelymaterial basis for efficacy. From the limited information available sofar, there is no evidence of potential safety issues and the safety data are limited.Conclusion: Collectively, this review provides a comprehensive overview of thebotany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and safety of H.sampsonii, a valuable medicinal plant in China with various pharmacologicalactivities.

Ethnomedicinal plants, which haveclinical evidence of efficacy and safety, play an important role in drugdiscovery and development (Cragg and Pezzuto, 2016; Anand et al.,2019; Choudhari et al., 2020). The Hypericum genus (Guttiferae)boasts over 460 species that are distributed worldwide, with theexception of arctic and desert regions and most tropical lowlands.(Committee, 2007). Some species are widely used in official medicinethroughout the world, such as Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John’swort) (Stojanovic et al., 2013). However, some endemic species ofHypericum have traditionally been used as folk medicine orethnomedicine in East Asia, particularly in China (Zhang et al.,2020). Hypericum sampsonii Hance (known as “Yuanbao Cao” inChinese), which is used as a traditional medicine in south ofChangjiang River, has been commonly used as a folk medicinewith functions of traumatic bleeding, enteritis, dysentery, and acutemastitis (Gong, 2014; Xie et al., 2021).Recent years have shown, growing interest of researchers in thechemical constituents and pharmacological effects of H. sampsonii.Previous chemical investigation of H. sampsonii reports a series ofmetabolites including polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols(PPAPs), benzophenones, flavonoids, xanthones,naphthodianthrones, anthraquinones, and aromatic compounds(Xie et al., 2021). The previously reported literatures haverevealed that H. sampsonii possesses multiple biologicalproperties, including anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive,antitumor, antidepressant, antimicrobial, antiviral, andantioxidant activities (Tian, 2015; Xie et al., 2021). Accordingly,in the present srudy, we have attempted a pharmacological analysisof the whole plant H. sampsonii to understand the primary target ofinflammation and to validate the ethnomedicine reports due to itsnumerous pharmacological activities and traditional claims of anti-inflammatory properties in the intestinal tract (Lin et al., 2022).However, biological activities and molecular mechanisms ofconstituents in H. sampsonii have not been fully explored, and acomprehensive and systematic review of this plant is lacking. Thepresent study will not only provide motivation to the growinginterest in recent years for a better understanding of theindication-discovery strategies but also assist the concept of drugrepurposing in the treatment of many other related clinicalconditions that may direct guide towords future research plan.In this review, the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry,pharmacological action, and safety of H. sampsonii have beensummarized along with discussion over future direction andfocus of H. sampsonii in the field of pharmacology.2 Materials and methodsThe relevant information was collected from various searchengines: Web of Science, SciFinder, PubMed, CBM, CNKI, GoogleScholar, etc. Other literature sources, i.e., classic books of Chinese herbalmedicine were also screened to get the maximal information on thisplant. The keywords used included H. sampsonii Hance, botany,phytochemistry, pharmacological activity, traditional uses, safety, andother related words. The plant namewas also checked withWorld FloraOnline (WFO (2023): Hypericum sampsonii Hance. Published on theInternet; http://www.worldfloraonline.org/taxon/wfo-0000728267.Accessed on: 04 February 2023).3 BotanyAccording to World Flora Online, this name of H. sampsoniiHance (Figure 1) of Hypericaceae family has been accepted, withother four synonyms includingHypericum electrocarpumMaxim,H.electrocarpum f. parvifolium R. Keller, Hypericum esquirolii H. Lév,and Hypericum oshimaense R. Keller, in the genus Hypericum(family Hypericaceae). As a folk medicine, various vernacularnames of H. sampsonii have been known in China, such asHezhang Cao, Shangtianti, Dahuanhun, etc (Table 1).H. sampsonii, which look like gold ingot (Yuanbao in Chinese) bythe connate perfoliate leaves, is a perennial herb with a height ofapproximately 0.2–0.8 m. The stem is erect and glabrous, withslender and short fibrous roots. The upright stem is cylindroid, andthe upper part is branched. The shape of leaves is oblong to lanceolate oroblanceolate, (2–) 2.5–7 (8) cm long, (0.7–) 1–3.5 cmwide, and the apexis obtuse or rounded, sessile, with entire margins. Leaves are arranged inopposite and basally completely connate, green above and light greenbelow with dense marginal black glands. The leaf midrib passes throughthe leaf apex, and both sides have four lateral veins oblique upward; thevein network is fine and sparse. Its inflorescences like corymbose,terminal, which form into the cylindrical panicle; the bracts andbractlets are linear-lanceolate or linear, 4 mm long, with anacuminate apex. The flowers are 6–10 (−15) mm in diameter, nearlyFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Sun et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1247675oblate, and cup-shaped at the base; the buds are ovate with an obtuseapex. The pedicel is slender and 2–3mm long; the sepals are oblong tooblong-spatulate or oblong-linear with 3–7 (–10) mm in length and1–3mm in width; the petals are light yellow, ovate, persistent, about 4–8(−13) mm long and 1.5–4 (−7) mmwide, with marginal sessile or nearlysessile black glands. There are three stamens, each containing10–14 stamens; the anther is light yellow with black glands. Theovary is ovoid to narrowly conical, three-celled, and about 3 mmlong; the style is 3, about 2 mm long, separated from the base. Thecapsule is ovate with a length of 6–9 mm and covered with yellowish-brown glands; seeds are small long ovate, about 1 mm long withyellowish-brown. The fluorescence duration is from May to June andthe fruiting period is from July to August. The whole plant is collected insummer or autumn, dried, and used for medicinal purposes (EditorialCommittee of Flora of China, 1990; Xie, 2014; Li et al., 2019).H. sampsonii not only favors a warm and humid environment butalso tolerant to cold and drought. This plant is usually living on hillsides,roadsides, scrub, grassland, fields, and ditches, with an altitude of0–1,200 m. It is commonly distributed in the south of the YangtzeRiver and Taiwan in China, and is also found in Japan, Northern VietFIGURE 1Photographs of H. sampsonii: the whole plant (A), the lateral view of connate perfoliate leaves (B), and medicinal material (C).TABLE 1 Vernacular names of H. sampsonii in China.Area Name Ref.Jiangxi Xiangsi, Dengtai, Shuanghehe, Duiye Cao, Daduiye Cao, Pai Cao, Duijing Cao, Sanxuedan Wu, 1963; Zhang et al.

According tothe Gu Shang Zhong Cao Yao Shi Yong Tu Ce (Li et al., 2019), thefresh herb is often processed by pounding or grinding and used totreat traumatic injuries, gouty arthritis, and finger sores. Inaddition to external application, the whole plant is generallymade into a decoction and taken orally for the treatment ofrheumatic arthralgia, hemoptysis due to pulmonary trauma,stranguria due to hematuria, dysmenorrhea, and aphthousulcers, etc. As a common folk medicine, the medicinal uses ofH. sampsonii are documented in many local medicinal classics(Table 2). For example, Hunan Yaowu Zhi recorded that the wholeplant of H. sampsonii can be used to treat diarrhea.H. sampsonii was also widely utilized as ethnomedicine bynational minorities in China. In Sandu Shui Autonomous Countylocated in the south of Guizhou Province of China, the botanicaldrug was commonly used as the liquor fermentation starter by theShui people. Besides the edible value, this wild plant also possesses awide range of medicinal values and can be used to treat irregularmenstruation, leucorrhea, dysentery, and fever (Hong et al., 2015b).Furthermore, it was often used as an herbal tea to treatgynaecopathia by the Yao minority (Jin et al., 2018). H.sampsonii was also the medicinal plant traditionally used byMulam people in Guangxi Province. It was mainly used to treatinternal hemorrhage, abnormal menstruation, dysmenorrhea, andbleeding wound (Hu et al., 2020). According to the ethnobotanicaldata collected from the Maonan minority,H. sampsonii was used forthe treatment of traumatic injury, pain, indigestion, chestcongestion, and acute icteric hepatitis (Hong et al., 2015a; Xianget al., 2018).Additionally, the whole plant of H. sampsonii is most frequentlyreported as a traditional treatment for various diseases. Commonly,two processing methods (internal use and external application) areused before clinical use or self-medication. Firstly, it is processed byremoving impurities and non-medicinal parts together withauxiliary materials such as honey and alcohol. Subsequently, thedried or fresh herb is often made as a decoction for oraladministration to treat various diseases. Furthermore, in thesecond step, the dried herb can be ground or freshly pounded,and applied to the affected area for external use.5 PhytochemistryChemical investigation of theHypericum species include a seriesof phloroglucinol derivatives, naphthodianthrones, xanthones,flavonoids, and other phenols and terpenoids (Zhang et al.,2020). Of these, phloroglucinol derivatives are the mainsecondary metabolites. H. sampsonii is a rich source of naturalproducts with diverse chemical structures. To date, a total of223 metabolites including polycyclic polyprenylatedacylphloroglucinols (PPAPs), benzophenones, xanthones,flavonoids, bisanthraquinones, and anthraquinones have beenseparated and identified from H. sampsonii (SupplementaryFigure S10).5.1 Polycyclic polyprenylatedacylphloroglucinols (PPAPs)Phloroglucinols, a type of natural products showing strongoxidizing properties, variable stereochemical structures, and awide range of pharmacological activities, are decorated withisoprenyl and hydroxyl groups which are substituted at multiplepositions on the benzene ring or fused together to form a ring (Xiaoand Mu, 2007). PPAPs were highly oxygenated acylphloroglucinolderivatives which decorated with complicated side chains. In thepast decades, PPAPs have received extensive attention due to theirconsiderable structural diversity and remarkable biological activities(Yang et al., 2018). Biogenetically, all PPAPs which are derived froma common biosynthetic pathway via different cyclizations of the lesscomplex monocyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols, aregenerated via three main biosynthetic pathways (Yang et al.,2018). Interestingly, this special class of phloroglucinols has beenexclusively isolated from the plants of family Guttiferae (Clusiaceae)and mainly from the genera Hypericum and Garcinia. Up toDecember 2022, 116 PPAPs comprise the major family ofmetabolites identified from H. sampsonii (Tables 3, 4, 5). All ofthe PPAP profiles are generated via three major biosyntheticpathways and may be divided into three groups according totheir different scaffolds. Group I are the bicyclic polyprenylatedacylphloroglucinols (BPAPs) with major bicyclo [3.3.1]nonane-2,4,9-trione core and related seco-BPAPs. Group II include thecaged PPAPs with adamantane (tricyclo [3.3.1.1]decane) andhomoadamantane (tricyclo [4.3.1.1]undecane) skeletons. GroupIII contain other biosynthetically related derivatives whichderived from direct cyclizations of monocyclic polyprenylatedacylphloroglucinols (MPAPs).5.1.1 Bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols(BPAPs)The bicyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (BPAPs) withmajor bicyclo [3.3.1] nonane-2,4,9-trione core and related seco-BPAPs (1–32, Table 3) include 32 BPAPs in which the acyl group islocated at the C-1 or C-3 position. In 2000, BPAPs (SampsonionesK-M, 27-29) were first discovered in the ethanolic extract of theaerial parts of H. sampsonii (Hu and Sim, 2000). Since then, BPAPshave been increasingly explored from the roots, fruits, and aerial partof H. sampsonii.5.1.2 Caged PPAPs with adamantane orhomoadamantane skeletonsIt is noteworthy that H. sampsonii is a rich source of cagedPPAPs, and about 64 adamantane- and homoadamantane-typederivatives with adamantane (tricyclo [3.3.1.1]decane) andhomoadamantane (tricyclo [4.3.1.1]undecane) (33–96,Table 4) have also been isolated from this plant. As early as1998, Hu and Sim isolated two caged PPAPs (sampsoniones Aand B, 85–86) from the aerial parts of H. sampsonii (Hu and Sim,1998). Subsequently, they discovered sampsoniones C-J (87–94)(Hu and Sim, 1999a; b, 2000). A few years later, sampsonionesFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Sun et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1247675Q-R (95–96) were isolated from the root of H. sampsonii (Xiaoet al., 2007). Since then, a large number of studies of caged PPAPswhich were isolated from H. sampsonii have been reported,primarily focusing on its structure diversity with anunprecedented carbon skeleton. The tetracyclo[6.3.1.1(3,10).0(3,7)]tridecane skeletons and biogeneticallyrelated congeners, such as 28,29-Epoxyplukenetione A (33)(Zhu et al., 2014), hyperisampsins A-G (43–49) (Zhu et al.,2014), hyperisampsins N (50), and hyperisampsins O (51)(Zhu et al., 2017a), hypersampsones A-E (52–56) (Lin andWu, 2003), hypersampsones L-S (60–66) (Zeng et al., 2012b),and hypersampsonones A-G (68–74) (Zhang et al., 2016).5.1.3 Other PPAPsA total of 20 other PPAPs such as spirocyclic PPAPs withoctahydrospiro-[cyclohexan-1,5′-indene] core and complicatedTABLE 3 Bicyclic Polyprenylated Acylphloroglucinols (BPAPs) isolated from H. sampsonii.No. Compound name Molecular formula Molecular weight Part of the plant Ref1 7-Epiclusianone C33H42O4 502.70 Root Xiao et al.

In 2011,a novel prenylated aromatic lactone (sampsone A, 107) wasisolated from the aerial parts of H. sampsonii (Xin et al.,2011). Soon afterwards, six new acylphloroglucinol derivatives,(sampsonols A-F, 108–113), were discovered from the aerialparts of H. sampsonii (Xin et al., 2012). In 2014, four newdecarbonyl PPAPs, (norsampsones A-D, 102-105), wereisolated from the 60% EtOH extract of the aerial parts of H.sampsonii (Tian et al., 2014c). Recently, three nor-polycyclicpolyprenylated acylphloroglucinols with a tetracyclic 6/5/5/6 ring system, (Hypersampones A-C, 114-116), which showeda lipid-lowering activity, were isolated from H. sampsonii.(Huang et al., 2022).5.2 BenzophenonesNatural benzophenone derivatives have attracted extensiveattention due to their unique structures and extensive biologicalactivities. In accordance with the literature, benzophenones, mainlyincluding simple benzophenone derivatives (SBDS) andpolyprenylated benzophenones (PPBS), may be the precursors ofsome xanthones (Kitanov and Nedialkov, 2001). Currently, there are33 benzophenones isolated from H. sampsonii (SupplementaryFigure S4; Table 6). Among them, two pairs of racemic PPBS,(±)-sampsonin A-B (117–120) were chirally separated from H.sampsonii (Tian et al., 2017a). In addition, seven benzophenonederivatives sampbenzophenones A-G (140–146) were isolated fromthe aerial parts of H. sampsonii (Zhu et al., 2016a).TABLE 4 (Continued) Caged PPAPs isolated from H. sampsonii.No. Compound name Molecular formula Molecular weight Part of the plant Ref71 Hypersampsonone D C39H52O6 616.84 Aerial part Zhang et al.

In addition, the discrepancy in xanthonesactivity depends on the substituents on the aromatic rings.In 1985, Chen MT and Chen CM isolated hyperxanthone (178)from the whole plant of H. sampsonii, and firstly discovered 2-hydroxy-3.4-dimethoxyxanthone (164) and isomangiferin (179) inthe genus Hypericum (Chen and Chen, 1985). Further study on theconstituents in the whole plant of H. sampsonii, Hong et al. alsoisolated two xanthone sulfonates, 1,3-dihydroxy-5-methoxyxanthone-4-sulfonate (158) and 1,3-dihydroxy-5-O-β-D-glucopyranosylxanthone-4-sulfonate (159) (Hong et al., 2004). Thereported metabolites and structures of xanthones are shown inSupplementary Figure S5; Table 7.5.4 FlavonoidsFlavonoids, including flavanols, biflavonoids, and commonflavonoids, constitute an important class of metabolites in H.sampsonii. To date, twelve flavonoids have been isolated andidentified from H. sampsonii (Supplementary Figure S6; Table 8).According to the documents, we have found that structures of thesemetabolites are generally based on the structure quercetin (193), inwhich the groups usually substitute at the 3- and 3′- positions, whileall of saccharide groups located at C-3 in flavonoid glycosides.5.5 NaphthodianthronesNaphthodianthrones, one out of the most biologically activesubstances inH. sampsonii, are mainly represented by hypericin andpseudohypericin (Supplementary Figure S7; Table 9). Hypericin(199), the active metabolite isolated from the flowers and fruitsof H. sampsonii, is considered the characteristic constituent for theidentification of this plant (Zeng et al., 2002). Subsequently,pseudohypericin (200) was isolated from the aerial parts of H.sampsonii (Zheng, 2005).5.6 AnthraquinonesAnthraquinones found in H. sampsonii generally include twotypes of single anthraquinones and bisanthraquinones. As shown inSupplementary Figure S8, compounds 201–204 are singleanthraquinones, while compounds 205–207 arebisanthraquinones. The chemical structures of anthraquinonesare listed in Table 10.TABLE 5 Other PPAPs isolated from H. sampsonii.No. Compound name Molecular formula Molecular weight Part of the plant Ref97 Hyperhexanone A C39H54O6 618.86 Aerial part Zhu et al.

The antinociceptive potential carriedout using acetic acid-induced writhing responses in mice andhot-plate test suggested that extracts of H. sampsonii effectivelysuppressed the writhing symptom and increased the pain thresholdof mice. Also, the anti-inflammatory effect was investigated usingdimethyl benzene-induced acute ear edema and carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats. Besides, the anti-inflammatoryactivity have been demonstrated by the reduction of acute earedema induced by dimethyl benzene and carrageenin-inducedpaw oedema (Pei et al., 2004). A study of our group toinvestigate the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms ofH. sampsonii (HS) in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-inducedulcerative colitis (UC) mice model (Lin et al., 2022). Theseresults indicate that HS distinctly alleviated DSS-stimulated UC-like lesions symptoms as evidenced by a significant recovery frombody weight, colon lengths, and histological injuries of colons.

Simultaneously, the colonicmRNA expression levels of IL- 1β, IL-17, iNOS and COX-2 were allsignificantly suppressed by HS in a dose-dependent manner.Furthermore, HS restored the protein expression of tightjunction-associated protein (ZO-1 and occluding). Further studieshave also reported that HS can significantly inhibit the protein levelof PDE4 and reduced the expressions of PKA andphosphorylated CREB.Experimental evidence has emerged to indicate that PPAPs areone of the major constituents required for anti-inflammatory effects.Since, it has been reported that a series of compounds isolated fromH. sampsonii, including hyperattenin C (3), otogirinin D (12),hyperisampsin I (15), hyperisampsin J (16), sampsonione L (28),hyperattenin G (38), hypersampsone O (63), hypersampsonone A(68), sampsonione A (85), and sampsonione B (86), were found tohave significant PDE4D2 inhibitory activity (Zhang et al., 2016).PDE4D2 is one of the subtypes of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4),which can specifically hydrolyze cAMP and participate in variousphysiological responses, and is a promising drug target forinflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.TABLE 13 (Continued) The biological activities of H. sampsonii.BiologicalactivitiesExtracts/compounds Models PositivecontrolResults RefAntimicrobial Root extract MDR S. aureus Norfloxacin MIC = 64 μg/mL Xiao et al.

In addition to PPAPs, other compoundssuch as benzophenone, xanthones, flavonoids, anthraquinones, andphenols, are also stated to possess anti-inflammatory properties(Chen et al., 2020).Besides, benzophenone derivatives have also been shown to beimportant in the anti-inflammatory effects of H. sampsonii.Recently, our group investigated the therapeutic effect andpotential mechanisms of 4-geranyloxy-2,6-dihydroxybenzophenonel (4-GDB, 133) on DSS-inducedulcerative colitis in mice (Wang et al., 2023). This study showedthat intragastric administration of 4-GDB (20 mg/kg/day) for 8 dayssignificantly attenuated colonic injury, reduced the expression ofinflammatory mediators, and improved colonic barrier function inmice with colitis. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro experimentsindicated that 4-GDB could activate cAMP/PKA/CREB and inhibitthe NF-κB pathway. Collectively, 4-GDB may be a potential agentfor treating UC by regulating the cAMP/PKA/CREB and NF-κBpathways.6.2 Antitumor activityThe antitumor activity ofH. sampsonii has been evaluated in variouscancer cell lines in vitro including A375, MDA-MB-231, SHSY-5Y, andSiHa cell lines (Chen et al., 2020). Studies have suggested that regulationof subcellular localization of retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR-α) is apotential method to induce tumor cell apoptosis. Zeng et al. have foundthat H. sampsonii extracts can induce the translocation of RXR-α fromthe nucleus to the cytoplasm, and promote the apoptosis of NIH-H460,MGC-803, and SMMC-7721 (Jin-Zhang et al., 2006). Besides, theethanol extract and the chloroform fraction especially weredemonstrated for apoptosis-inducing and antitumor properties viainhibiting RXR-α transcription (Han et al., 2007).Moreover, the antitumor effect has also been documented for a panelof natural products in H. sampsonii, such as 7-epiclusianone (1) (Saleset al., 2015), sampsonione A (85) (Hu and Sim, 1999a), sampsonione I(93) (Hu and Sim, 1999a), mangiferin (181) (Mei et al., 2021),naringenin (192) (Memariani et al., 2021), quercetin (193)(Murakami et al., 2008; Dajas, 2012) and rutin (198) (Imani et al., 2021).6.3 Antidepressant activityDepression is a common mental disorder characterized bysyndromes like depressed mood, hopelessness, and even thoughts ofsuicide. Clinical studies have demonstrated that H. perforatum L. (St.John’s Wort), a member of the Hypericum genus, has significantantidepressant impacts. The extract of this plant was introduced intothe market as an antidepressant in Germany in 1988, and became thepreferred phytomedicine for the treatment of depressive disorder inEuropean and American regions. Intriguingly, previously reportedstudies have also isloated an antidepressant active metabolitehyperforin rom H. perforatum and its also present in H. sampsonii(Zheng et al., 2003).In 2003, the ethanol extracts ofH. sampsonii were demonstrated fora significant antidepressant effect on the behavior despair animal models(Wan et al., 2003). It was believed that the total flavonoids of H.sampsonii showed antidepressant activity in the hypothermiaexperiments induced by reserpine and the forced swimming test. Instudies utilizing the forced swimming test, tail suspension test, and open-field test, H. sampsonii extracts, HTX fraction, and mangiferin (181)induced a significant reduction in immobility, and the antidepressantmechanism of HTXmight be related to neurotransmitters (Gong, 2014).The antidepressant properties of H. sampsonii have been attributed tovarious phytochemical constituents, such as hyperforin (6), hyperoside(194), and hypericin (199) (Nahrstedt and Butterweck, 2010; Bridi et al.,2018). However, the precise mechanism of action for the antidepressantcapacity of this plant remains indistinct.FIGURE 2Graphical summary of the compounds and pharmacological activities of H. sampsonii.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org19Sun et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.12476756.4 Antiviral activityPrevious studies have suggested that the extracts and severalcompounds of H. sampsonii have antiviral activity. For instance,the chloroform and n-butyl alcohol fractions as well askaempferol (189) were shown to possess antiviral activityagainst avian influenza virus H5N1 in the Madin DarbyCanine Kidney (MDCK) screening experiment (Yin, 2014).Besides, Lin and Wu found that hypersampsone A-F (52–56,9) isolated from H. sampsonii exhibited anti-HBV activity on theMS-G2 cell line (Lin and Wu, 2003). In addition, the antiviralactivity has been reported for hypericin (199) andpseudohypericin (200) against herpes simplex virus types1 and 2 and HIV-1 in vitro. Hypericin (199) has alsoexhibited activity against HCV, murine cytomegalovirus(MCMV), Sindbis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, and novelduck reovirus (Barnes et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2022).6.5 Antimicrobial activityPlants belonging to the Hypericum genus are a crucial sourceof antimicrobial compounds (Marrelli et al., 2016). Previousevidence indicated that the antibacterial activity has beendemonstrated for hyperforin (6) and quercetin (193) againstStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcuspyogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheria, etc (Barnes et al.,2001; Nguyen and Bhattacharya, 2022). In studies using MDR S.aureus strain SA-1199B to determine the antibacterial effect of H.sampsonii, the MIC of the petroleum ether extract of the root wasup to 64 μg/mL (Xiao et al., 2007). Moreover, 7-epiclusianone (1)induced potent antibacterial activity against SA-1199B with aMIC of 4 μg/mL, while MIC of the positive control (norfloxacin)was 32 μg/mL (Xiao et al., 2007). In other antibacterialexperiments, some PPAPs including sampsone A (107) andhypericumxanthone A (174) were shown to exhibit goodantibacterial activity on Methicillin-resistant S. aureus(MRSA), with MIC values of 32 μg/mL and 16 μg/mLrespectively (Xin et al., 2011).6.6 Antioxidant activityReactive oxygen species (ROS), the important substancesreleased from neutrophils, play a part in cell signaling andhomeostasis. It is, however, important to note, that theoverproduction of ROS can initiate the inflammatory cascadeand subsequent cell damage as well as tissue dysfunction underoxidative stress (Chen et al., 2009). Research revealed that H.sampsonii showed antioxidant capacity by regulating the contentof oxidase (GSH and SOD) (Chen et al., 2009). It has also beenreported that the ethyl acetate extract of H. sampsonii couldalleviate oxidative stress as indicated by reversing the abnormallevels of CAT, GSH, MDA, and SOD in mice with colitis (Linet al., 2022). Additionally, the antioxidant activity of mangiferin(181) from H. sampsonii was assessed by means of the DPPHradical scavenging assay with an IC50 value of 35.48 μM (DungNguyen et al., 2021).7 SafetyMany ancient classics and medicinal books have recordedthat the clinical administration dosage of H. sampsonii should be9–15 g for dried herb or 30–60 g for fresh herb. To furtherdetermine the safety of therapeutic doses of H. sampsonii, aprevious study by Lin et al. (2022), fed mice with the ethylacetate extract at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. After 14 days ofobservation, there was no morphological abnormality inmajor organs, indicating that the ethyl acetate extract of H.sampsonii showed no toxicity. Although the toxicity studies andthe wide range of edible and medicinal values of H. sampsoniimay provide a preliminary reference for its high safety in clinicalapplication; however, the potential toxicity cannot be completelyexcluded.According to the Chinese Materia Medica, morphological andmicroscopic examinations as well as physicochemical identificationshould be used to control the quality ofH. sampsonii. Meanwhile, forits medicinal application, it is should also contain hypericin (199)and flavonoids (Editorial Board of Chinese Materia Medica, 1999).Yet, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) identification and contentdetermination as well as other analytical methods have not beenemployed to control the quality of this plant, indicating a lack ofquality standard despite its extensive folk utilization. Besides, there isno indication of potential safety issues. Therefore, further researchwork is essentially required to meet these standards.8 Conclusion and perspectivesAs a common botanical drug for the treatment of dysentery,enteritis, and irregular menstruation in folk,H. sampsonii is safe andeffective. It is a versatile plant with a complexity of phytochemicalsand remarkable pharmacological actions. In this paper, we reviewedthe botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacologicalactivities, and safety of this species for the first time. It wasfound that more than 220 chemicals have been isolated andidentified from this plant, including PPAPs, benzophenones,xanthones, flavonoids, naphthodianthrones, anthraquinones, andaromatic compounds, among others. Among the identifiedcompounds, PPAPs are the most abundant compounds withnovel structures as well as up-and-coming biologicalcharacteristics, such as PDE4 inhibitory activity. Although,accumulating studies have shown the progress in theunderstanding of its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor,antidepressant, antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties.However, further studies should focused on the isolation of newcompounds and biological screening tests in vitro from H.sampsonii. Yet, it is also important to mention that empiricalpharmacologic studies are insufficient to validate the claimedhealing properties.It is noteworthy that H. perforatum L., the most familiarspecies of the Hypericum genus, has been extensivelyinvestigated due to its medicinal values and was listed in theChinese Pharmacopoeia in 2015. Nevertheless, H. sampsonii hasnot yet been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, whichpotentially prevents in-depth research to a large extent.Taken together, the current pharmacological research on H.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org20Sun et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1247675sampsonii remains in infancy, and other aspects such as safetyevaluation and quality control standards are scanty. This reviewprovided a systematic overview of this plant based on theavailable research while not comprehensive. Therefore,further studies including pharmacological mechanismsin vitro and in vivo, structure-activity relationship appraisal,safety evaluation, and quality standards should be done. Moreemerging studies may reveal the scientific connotation of thetraditional application and lay the foundation for thedevelopment and utilization of H. sampsonii.Author contributionsZS: methodology, writing—original draft, writing—review andediting, funding acquisition, supervision.
