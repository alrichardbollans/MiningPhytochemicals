(COMPOSITAE) TISSUE CULTURES1 KAREN WICKHAM,2 ELOY RODRIGUEZ,3 AND JOSEPH ARDITTI Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, California 92717 Roots, stems, petioles, and leaf blades of mature plants of Parthenimn hysterophoms and callus cultures derived from explants of these organs from aseptically grown seedlings were screened for the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Parthenin was not detected in roots but was present in callus cultures from all sources. Coronopilin was detected only in petioles and leaf blades and callus cultures derived from these organs. These findings suggest that synthesis of parthenin and coronopilin is not limited to the glandular trichomes. Introduction Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Compositae), a plant indigenous to the Americas, has spread to Australia and India, becoming an aggressive weed. It contains the sesquiterpene lactone, parthenin (fig. 1), a constituent which causes allergic contact dermatitis in humans and is toxic to livestock (TOWERS et al. 1977). Because of the wide spectrum of biological activity exhibited by parthenin and related sesqui-terpene lactones, we developed a tissue culture method for studying its biosynthesis and localization. Material and methods SEED GERMINATION.- Seeds of Parthenium hy-sterophorus were sterilized with saturated calcium hypochlorite solution (WILSON 1915) containing 2- 5 drops of T ween 80 by shaking vigorously for 5 min and rinsing three times with sterile distilled water. Hoagland's solution (HOAGLAND and ARN ON 1938), solidified with 13 g agar/ liter and autoclaved, was used as the germination medium. Erlenmeyer flasks (125 ml), each containing SO ml medium and three or four seeds, were employed as culture vessels. The cultures were maintained under 22 ± 2 C, illumi-nated with 3 mW/ cm2, and 18-h photo periods were provided by a combination of Gro Lux 40-W fluores-cent tubes and 25-W incandescent bulbs. TrssUE CULTURE.-Two media, Heller's (HEL-LER 1953) and MS (MURASHIGE and SKOOG 1962) were modified (table 1) by the addition of GAa, two auxins (NAA and 2,4-D), and three cytokinins (BAP, kinetin, and 6-DMAP) . The minerals, vita-mins, sugars, and agar were autoclaved. Hormones (stock solutions in 95% ethanol) were added to the 1 Abbreviations used: BAP = benzylaminopurine; 2,4-D = dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; 6-DMAP = 6-dimethylamino-purine; GA3 = gibberellic acid; HPLC = high performance liquid chromatography; MS= Murashige-Skoog medium; NAA = naphthalene acetic acid; TLC= thin layer chroma-tography. 2 Undergraduate research project in phytochemistry and plant physiology. 3 Address for reprint requests.

Each tissue-medium combination was repli-cated 15 times. EXCISION OF EXPLANTS.- Cotyledons were ex-cised from newly germinated seedlings. Leaf blades, roots, stems, and petioles were removed from 30-150-day-old plants. The leaf blades were cultured intact. After removal of petiole stubs, stems were sectioned into ca. 5-mm sections. Roots were cut into ca. 2.5-cm lengths. ExTRACTION.-Callus, roots, stems, leaf blades, or petioles were ground in chloroform and filtered (RODRIGUEZ 1976). If the filtrate contained water as well as CHC'3, the aqueous fraction was evaporated in vacuo to an oil. Components of the oil were moni-tored by TLC (silica gel G developed with ben-zene: acetone, 4: l, vol/vol). Individual components were visualized with iodine vapor and/ or concen-trated H2S01/ CcS04 (50:5, vol/wt) and 0.5 g vanil-lin dissolved in a solution of 9 ml EtOH and 0.5 m H2S0 4 (PICMAN, RANIERI, and TOWERS 1980). Au-thentic samples of parthenin and coronopilin were cochromatographed with extracts (fig. 1).

Merck 5765), dried, and applied to the top of a microcolumn. E lution was with hexane, benzene, and increasing amounts of ethyl acetate and methanol. Four frac-tions were collected for analysis by TLC and HPLC. TLC.-Two-dimensional chromatography of leaf, petiole, and callus extract, following preparatory chromatography, established the presence of small amounts of coronopilin and parthenin (PrcMAN et al. 1980). HPLC.- The yellow oil from the ethyl acetate fraction was dissolved in nanograde acetonitrile, filtered through a FH Millipore filter (0.5 µm pore size), and injected in a Waters Associates liquid chromatograph with a Model 440 absorbance detec-tor set at 254 nm. The mobile phase was acetoni-trile: water (30: 70, vol/vol) using a C.s Bondapak Waters Associates column. T he retention time was compared with standard solutions of authentic sam-p les of sesquiterpene lactones, parthenin, corono-pilin, and ambrosin (fig. 1, table 2).

TrssuE CULTURE.-None of the explants produced calli on Heller's medium. Callus formation did occur on MS. Hormone combinations influenced the nature and growth of these calli (table 1). Callus formed more readily from mature plant tissues than from those of young seedlings and cotyledons (table 1). Roots formed on callus derived from 1- 2-mo-old seedlings. Shoots and roots were produced on callus derived from 5-mo-old plants. After 5 wk of culture, rapidly growing calli started to turn brown. Transfer to a new medium generally accelerated the browning and frequently caused death. Growth was slow following subculture of older calli. Friable callus was always formed from root ex-plants. At 0.1 mg/ liter 2,4-D callus initiation, root development, and the appearance of shoots were enhanced by cytokinin concentrations of 0.1 or 0.5 mg/liter (table 1: media nos. Al, Bl, Gl, and Hl).4 A combination of kinetin and BAP, each at 0.1 mg/ liter, increased callus formation and growth (table 1: medium no. El). Increasing the 2,4-D concentration to 0.5 mg/ liter did not promote callus growth (i.e., increase in volume), even at • Numbers correspond to tissues. cytokinin levels that appeared optimal (table 1: media nos. J l, Kl, Ll, Ml, Nl, 01, Ql). When the concentration of 2,4-D was 0.1 mg/ liter, some cul tu res tended to form roots (table 1: media nos. Al, Bl, Cl, El, Gl, Hl). Higher con-centrations of the auxin suppressed this tendency (table 1: media nos. Ll, Ml, Nl, 01, Ql) . Roots produced by callus masses were very short and covered with hairs. They usually reverted back to callus (table 1: media nos. Al, Bl, Cl, El, Gl, Hl, Jl). On media containing NAA, 6-DMAP, and/ or GAa, the roots became long, thickened, and did not revert (table 1: media nos. Dl, Fl- F4, Il, 14). Root production on all tissues was enhanced bv 6-DMAP. Callus from stem explants developed ~ost rapidly when auxin levels exceeded the concentration of either BAP or kinetin (table 1: media nos. K4, Q4). The addition of equal amounts of BAP and kinetin also promoted callus development in some instances (table 1: media nos. C4, E4, N4, 04). At higher levels of 2,4-D, the combination of auxin and BAP stimu-lated growth of callus (table 1: media nos. K4, M4) . When the concentration of 2,4-D was equal to that of the cytokinin, callus was initiated but failed to grow (table 1: medium no. B4). Leaf blade callus developed most rapidly when the auxin level equaled or exceeded that of BAP (table 1: media nos. B3, C3, K3, 03). The same was true for callus derived from petioles (table 1: media nos. B2, C2, E2, G2, K2, M2, N2, 02, Q2) . Callus 438 BOTANICAL GAZETTE (DECEMBER initiated from both leaf and petiole explants failed to grow rapidly when the cytokinin concentration was greater than that of the auxin (table 1: media nos. P2, P3). Addition of equal amounts of BAP and kinetin promoted development of callus from both explant sources if auxin concentration equaled or exceeded that of either cytokinin (table 1: media nos. C2, C3, E2, E3, 02, 03). Explants from leaf, petiole, and stem tissues re-sponded to hormone combinations similarly, but their calli differed in appearance. Leaf callus was always friable and uniformly pale green. Stem callus was frequently firmer, nonuniform in color, and spread in concentric circles. Friability increased in direct proportion to increasing hormone levels. Peti-ole callus appeared more like that derived from stems when it developed on a cut end. When it emerged from the side of the petiole, it resembled leaf-derived callus. Stems, petioles, and leaf blades contained substan-tial amounts of parthenin. Only petioles and leaf blades contained coronopilin (table 2). The chro-matographic evidence (table 2) suggested the pres-ence of parthenin (.fig. 1) in nearly all calli regardless of explant origin or culture medium except for media nos. Bl and B4. An unknown polar compound, Ua (table 2), was detected in extracts of all calli and plant tissues. Compound Ua was always present in the callus in greater quantities than parthenin. The reverse was true for all plant tissues from which calli were derived, but parthenin was usually absent in roots (table 2) . Peak heights suggested that the quantities produced were different. Generally the calli produced a larger array of compounds than plant tissues. Two additional unknown compounds (Ub and Uc) were detected in callus tissues. Only Ub was found in roots of 116-day-old plants. The Ub and Uc were not detected with certainty in any other tissues or organs; Ub was more polar than parthenin, whereas Uc was less so. The polarity of Uc was intermediate between coronopilin and ambrosin. A fourth unknown, Ud, was detected in 75% of the callus tissues derived from leaf blades, 67% of those obtained from petioles, and 75% of those cultured from root explants (table 2). Ambrosin was not detected in any tissue. Discussion Callus cultures derived from young Parthenium hysterophorus tissues tend to produce roots (table 1); those derived from older tissues produce roots and shoots. In contrast, explants from young leaves of Phalaenopsis (Orchidaceae) produce a larger number of protocorm-like bodies (i.e., shoots) than those from older ones (TANAKA, HASEGAWA, and Gor 1975). Young shoots of Sequoia sempervirens (T axo-diaceae) produce callus more readily than older ones (E. A. BALL and D. M. MORRIS, personal communi-cation) . Callus of Salpiglossis sinuata (Solanaceae) derived from older leaves undergoes organogenesis more readily than that from younger ones (LEE et al. 1977). These reports suggest that the tendency to produce roots or shoots from callus may not depend on the age of the tissue used as a source of explants. Callus initiation from P. hysterophorus stem ex-plants is better with 2,4-D than with NAA (table 1) . The reverse is true for Garica papaya (Caricaceae) (ARORA and SINGH 1978) and Araucaria araucana (Araucariaceae) (BENIEST and DEBERGH 1976). Or-chid cultures respond differently to various auxins (ARDITTI 1977), as do tobacco, peas, rice, and barley (SEKIYA, YASUDA, and YAMADA 1977). The reasons for these differences are not entirely clear, and that specificity of auxin acceptors, degradation, and mo-lecular structure may be involved (SEKIYA et al. 1977). High auxin/ cytokinin ratios favor callus induction from stem, leaf blade, and petiole explants of P. hysterophorus (table 1). Similar responses have been obtained with stem explants of Dioscorea alata (Dio-scoreaceae) (MANTELL, H AGUE, and WHITEHALL 1978), Manilwt esculenta (Euphorbiceae) (PARKE 1978), and A . araucana (BENIEST and D EBERGH 1976), as well as with leaf tip cultures of Laeliocat-tleya and Epidendmm (Orchidaceae) (CHURCHILL, BALL, and ARDITTI 1973). On the other hand, low auxin/ cytokinin ratios stimulate callus initiation from leaf blade explants of Phalaenopsis (TANAKA et al. 1975), Peperomia 'Red Ripple' (Piperaceae) (HENNY 1978), Anthurium andraenum (Araceae) (PIERIK 1976), and Ficus lyrata (Moraceae) (DE-BERGH and DE WAF.L 1977), as well as from petioles of Phoenix dactylifera (Palmae) (EEUWENS 1978). Initiation and growth of callus derived from P. hysterophoms root explants is enhanced by a low (1: 5) auxin/ cytokinin ratio. Roots of Bryophyllum calycinum (Crassulaceae) require somewhat higher (1: 1 or 1: 2) ratios (ROBBINS and HERVEY 1978). Hence, with the possible exception of stems, there seems to be no clear pattern regarding the effects of auxin/ cytokinin ratios on root and stem formation in callus cultures or even a requirement for the latter. An interesting point in connection with cytokinins is the contrast between the effects of 6-DMAP and BAP or kinetin on root growth: 6-DMAP induces long thick roots; the others do not. Phytochemical investigations of economically im-portant plants in tissue culture have provided a wealth of information relating to biosynthesis, me-tabolism, and compartmentalization of natural prod-ucts, indicating that they produce a greater diversity of constituents than intact plants (REINERT and BAJAJ 1977). In our investigation, P. hyslerophorns callus cultures and mature plants differ in their terpenoid chemistry. Roots of mature plants do not accumulate the pseudoguaianolide sesquiterpene lac-1980] WICKHAM ET AL.-PARTHENIUM HYSTEROPHORUS 439 tones (table 2). Calli derived from stems, roots, petioles, and leaves all produced parthenin, while petioles and leaves also contained coronopilin and a series of unknown constituents. Differences in chemical content of calli derived from the same explant were brought about by media composition. The greatest number of unidentified metabolites is produced by the root callus, which also contains parthenin. This is of interest since previous reports have implied that sesquiterpene lactones are synthesized in glandular trichomes. Our findings suggest that these compounds may be pro-duced elsewhere (e.g., chloroplasts [GoODWlN 1967]) and possibly transported into trichomes. However, the possibility that sesquiterpene lactones are pro-duced in trichomes cannot be ruled out because volatile monoterpenes are synthesized in these struc-tures (LOOMIS and CROTEAU 1966).
