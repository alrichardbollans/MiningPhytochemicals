These plants exhibit wideadaptability and strong stress resistance, thriving in warm, moistenvironments with deep, fertile, well-drained soil (pH 5.5–6.5) andan annual average temperature above 10°C. Ehretia species grow invarious habitats, from tropical forests to dry regions, showcasingresilience compared to less adaptive genera like Myosotis (Mandaland Joshi, 2014; Retief and VanWyk, 2001; Shukla and Kaur, 2018).The genus includes only tree or shrub species (http://www.iplant.cn/). Various parts of the Ehretia plants-roots, leaves, flowers, barks,fruits, and heartwoods-are used in herbal medicine and consumed asfood (Li et al., 2010a; Lim et al., 2023; Hadjichambis et al., 2008; Zaraet al., 2012). In folklore, Ehretia species were employed asethnomedicine to treat a variety of cough, inflammation,swellings and syphilis, et al. (Iqbal et al., 2005). Notably, somespecies such as Ehretia corylifolia, E. longiflora, E. macrophylla, E.thyrsiflora, and E. tsangii are recognized for their antipyretic anddetoxifying properties in traditional Chinese medicine (Zeng andZeng, 1994). The bitter tea known as “Kudingcha” in Chinese hashistorically been made locally using the leaves of E. thyrsiflora (Heand Liu, 1992). “Tsaang gubat” also known as E. microphylla, ispresently included in the Philippine National Formulary and isrecognised by the Department of Health as one of the toptherapeutic plants recommended in the nation (Legaspi andBagaoisan, 2020).According to literatures, more than 100 compounds have beenidentified from Ehretia genus. These compounds includingflavonoids, phenylpropanoids, simple phenolics, benzoquinones,triterpenoids, fatty acids and so on (Chien et al., 2012; Le et al.,2021; Li et al., 2009; Yamamura et al., 1995; Yoshikawa et al., 1995).The extracts and compounds of Ehretia species exhibited a range ofbioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic, hepatoprotective,analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer,antihemolytic, anti-arthritic, wound healing effects, etc (Harneet al., 2021; Jan et al., 2023; Kaur et al., 2019; Kaur et al., 2022;Memon et al., 2022; Panja et al., 2020; Rangnathrao andShanmugasundaram, 2019; Waheed et al., 2019).To date, only two review articles focus on the genus Ehretia, withthe most recent one occurring 6 years ago (Li et al., 2010a; Shuklaand Kaur, 2018). This review aims to provide a comprehensiveoverview of the botany, ethnomedicinal values, phytochemistry,pharmacology, toxicology, clinical studies, cultivation, andcommercial value of the genus Ehretia (Mitsi and Echeverría,2024). Due to the genus’s diversity, only species with provenmedicinal characteristics will be highlighted. Additionally, thisreview addresses the limitations of current research and suggestsdirections for future studies, offering insights to guide upcomingresearch on Ehretia species.2 Ethnomedicinal uses of genus EhretiaThe Flora Reipubae Popularis Sinicae categorizes all plants in thegenus Ehretia as either trees or shrubs (Table 1) (EditorialFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359Committee of the Flora of China, 1985). This genus ispredominantly found in southern Asia, China, Africa, North andSouth America (Figure 1). In China, twelve species and one variantare identified, primarily in provinces south of the Yangtze River,with additional occurrences in southern Gansu, Henan, Shaanxi,and Qinghai. It is only known that 12 species of the genus areutilized in traditional medicine (Table 2). Rich folklore medicalapplications for Ehretia plants include treatments for syphilis,eczema, stomach disorders, cough, diarrhea, and chest pains(Arenas et al., 2013; Mncwangi et al., 2012; Torane et al., 2011;Waheed et al., 2019). The Ehretia genus also contributessignificantly to forest ecosystems as a source of food for birdsand insects due to its fleshy drupes and nectar-rich flowers.Unlike invasive or fast-spreading members of Boraginaceae (e.g.,Heliotropium indicum), Ehretia species are generally regardedas ecologically harmonious, adding to their conservationimportance.Among the earliest species in the Ehretia genus is E. acuminata,which has been traditionally used to treat fever, tongue sores, diarrhea,and other ailments in China and India (Choudhury et al., 2012; Shuklaet al., 2019b; Wang and Huang, 2005). The leaves of E. thyrsiflora (syn.E. acuminata) serve as one of the sources for Kudingcha, a bitter teapopular in southern China (Li et al., 2009). In Nigeria, folk medicineutilizes the leaves of E. anacua to cure diabetes (Abimbola et al., 2021).E. asperula, endemic to northern Vietnam, has a history of use intreating cancer, liver cirrhosis, and hepatitis (Hoang et al., 2021; Le et al.,2021). The small tree E. cymose is predominantly found in thesecondary jungles and savannas of Africa. Its fruits are black, ovoidto spherical, measuring 2–6 mm in length, and the leaves are oval inshape (Sarkodie et al., 2015). In several parts of Ethiopia, the leaves of E.cymose are traditionally employed to treat feverish illnesses,rheumatism, headaches, and measles (Figure 2) (Alemayehu et al.,2015; Ashagrie et al., 2023; Fassil and Gashaw, 2019; Ogundajoet al., 2016).Folk medicine for alleviating swelling often utilizes the bark of E.dicksonii (Xu et al., 2022). For respiratory conditions such as sphagitis,amygdalitis, and coughs, the fruit of E. macrophylla-identified as thesame species as E. dicksonii-along with herbal tea, serves as traditionalremedies (Deng et al., 2020; Liu, 2003). E. laevis, a deciduous shrubnative to tropical regions of Asia and Australia, is recognized for itssignificant therapeutic value in traditional medicine (Velappan andThangaraj, 2014). In Uttarakhand and other sub-Himalayan regions ofIndia, the herbal medicine is used to treat jaundice (Rangnathrao andShanmugasundaram, 2019). Its utilization can be traced back to ancientmedical systems, including Ayurveda and Siddha (Sharma et al., 2021).The plant uses its inner bark for sustenance and nutrition. This plant’sleaves can be used to cure headaches, skin conditions, and ulcers. Thisplant’s fruit is frequently used to treat lung and spleen ailments, urinarytract issues, astringent, deworming, diuretic, analgesic, and expectorantconditions (Joshi and Wagh, 2019).Carmona retusa (syn. E. microphylla) is a striking shrub reachingheights of 1.5–4.0 m, characterized by its glossy, coarse, dark greenleaves. In addition to medicinal uses, certain species like E. microphyllaare also cultivated for ornamental purposes and bonsai (Aarthi et al.,2014; Mageswari and Karpagam, 2015; Mageswari et al., 2012). E.microphylla is particularly significant in the Philippines and India,especially within the Ayurvedic and Siddha medical traditions (Chopraet al., 1956; Selvanayagam et al., 1996). A leaf infusion serves as a teaalternative and cough suppressant for conditions involving bloodydischarge and diarrhea (Ali et al., 2019; Yuvaraja et al., 2021). InSiddha Materia Medica, it is used to treat leprosy, sexually transmittedinfection-related dermatitis, chronic dysentery, infertility, and toxicdiarrhea in children (Kudera et al., 2021). Additionally, the root actsas an antidote for vegetable poisoning and treats syphilis and cachexia(Aarthi et al., 2014).In Zimbabwe, various compounds from E. obtusefolia areutilized to cure infertility in women, menstrual cramps, stomachspasms, sore throats, and children’s teething pain (Jan et al., 2023).E. philippinensis, endemic to low- and medium-altitude forests inthe Philippines, is known for its stem bark and leaves that aid intreating certain inflammatory processes (Simpol et al., 1994). Thesmall deciduous tree or shrub E. rigida, also known as the “puzzlebush,” has its stems usedmedicinally by the Zulu people, and its fruitis edible (Steyn, 1998).E. tinifolia, an evergreen tree native to Mexico and theUnited States, can grow up to 25 m. Its small, round, fragrantyellow fruit is commonly consumed, while the bark aids woundrecovery, and the flowers and leaves can alleviate symptoms ofbloody vomiting (Hadjichambis et al., 2008; Pío-León et al., 2012b;Lim et al., 2023; Pío-León et al., 2012a). In conclusion, variousFIGURE 1Geographical distribution of Ehretia species plants in the world(Cite from http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org).TABLE 1 Morphological features of Ehretia genus (Flora of China).Part FeaturesLeaf Leaves petiolate, entire or serrate at marginFlower Inflorescences corymbose or paniculate-cymose.

Consequently, these species warrant furtherbiological and chemical investigation.3 PhytochemistryOne hundred and one compounds were identified from Ehretiagenus, including flavonoids, phenypropanoids, simple phenolics,benzoquinones, triterpenoids, sterols, fatty acids and othercompounds (Figures 3–9). These compounds have been identifiedin a variety of Ehretia species, including the fruit, roots, leaves, andbark (Table 3). Certain chemicals exhibited numerous bioactivitiesboth in vitro and in vivo.3.1 FlavonoidsFlavonoids and their derivatives comprise the primary compoundsof the Ehretia species. More than 16 compounds, including flavonoidsand its glucoside (1–13, 15), a flavanonol (14) and a flavanol (16) havebeen identified from leaves ofE. thyrsiflora, E.Asperula, E. ovalifolia andfruits of E. macrophylla. Flavonoid glycosides comprise a diverse rangeof sugars, including glucose (Glc), galactose (Gla), arabinose (Ara) andrhamnose (Rha). Compounds 9–11 amd 14 have two different sugars.Ovalifolin (15) is a new isopentenyl flavonoid got from E. ovalifolialeaves (Khattab et al., 2001). (+)-Catechin hydrate (16) is a flavanolidentified from the fruit of E. macrophylla (He, 2018). Each of themcontains only hydroxyl groups and lacks methoxyl groups on theiraromatic rings.3.2 PhenypropanoidsThis genus is rich in phenypropanoids (17–37), which usuallyshow C6-C3 carbon skeleton. The compounds can be categorizedinto phenylpropionic acids and lignans and got from the fruit,leaves and bark of Ehretia species. Compounds 17–22 are thesimple phenylpropionic acids. Ehretiate (23) is a new trans-icosanyl sinapate that has been isolated from the root of E.longiflora (Chien et al., 2012). Rosmarinic acid (27) is an esterof caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid that possessesa diverse range of activities (Ijaz et al., 2023; Petersen, 2013;Petersen and Simmonds, 2003). The Labiatae and Boraginaceaefamily contain the greatest concentration of rosmarinic acidTABLE 2 Record of the traditional uses of some Ehretia species (http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org).Accepted name Synonym name Common name Traditional use ReferencesEhretia acuminata R.Br Ehretia thyrsiflora var.latifolia NakaiEhretia serrata Roxb.Ehretia ovalifolia HasskKudingcha (China)Puna (Pakistan); Koda;Pudila; NaraTo cure fever, sores on tongue, dysentery Choudhury et al.

Three novel compounds were obtainedfrom the dried whole plant of E. obtusifolia: trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl-2-O-p-coumaroyl β-D-glucopyranoside(24), methyl 2-O-feruloyl-1α-O-vanillactate (25) and caffeicanhydride (29); Ehletianol C (34), buddlenol B (35) and ethyllithospermate (36) are lignans containing 3 phenylpropanes (Leet al., 2021; Yoshikawa et al., 1995). Four phenylpropanesconnected by C-C and C-O-C bonds combine to generate thelignan known as lithospermic acid B (37) (Li et al., 2009).3.3 Simple phenolicsThe novel phenolic compounds, called ehletianols A and B (38and 39), were separated from the bark of E. ovalifolia and containtwo sugars (Yoshikawa et al., 1995). Simple phenolics with carboxylor ester groups are compounds 40–44. The root of E. longiflorayielded ehretiamide (45), a novel phenolic containing acetyl group(Chien et al., 2012). Ehretioside B (46) is a new phenolic whichconnected with a cyanomethylene acid group (Simpol et al., 1994).FIGURE 2The pictures of fruits, leaves and flowers of some Ehretia species plants.FIGURE 3The structure of flavonoids from Ehretia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359Simple phenolics containing an isopentene or aldehyde groupinclude prenylhydroquinone (47), 4-hydroxy-3-prenylbenzoic(48), proglobeflowery acid (49) (Chien et al., 2012).3.4 BenzoquinonesSeven benzoquinones dimeric prenylbenzoquinone moietieswere identified in the aerial portions of E. microphylla, the rootbark of E. buxifolia, and the root of E. longiflora. The absoluteconfiguration of three novel compounds-microphyllone (51),ehretianone (56) and ehretiquinone (57)-was determined usingX-ray crystallographic analysis (Agarwal et al., 1980; Chien et al.,2012; Selvanayagam et al., 1996). Compounds 52–55 are thecongeners of microphyllone (51) (Yamamura et al., 1995).3.5 Triterpenoids and sterolsTo now, only 3 types of triterpenoids (ursulane type,oleanane type and lupinane type) were reported from theEhretia genus. These are all common triterpenoids, except forFIGURE 4The structure of phenylpropanoids from Ehretia species.FIGURE 5The structure of simple phenolics from Ehretia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359FIGURE 6The structure of benzoquinones from Ehretia species.FIGURE 7The structure of triterpenoids and sterols from Ehretia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359ehretiolide (62) (Chien et al., 2012). Ehretiolide (62) is a newursulane type triterpenoid containing the O-(E)-4′-methoxylcinnamoyl and lactone groups. Additionally, theGC-MS detected every sterol with the exception of thedaucoster (75), which was determined by TLC (Li et al., 2010b).3.6 Fatty acidsThis genus has been observed to contain 17 fatty acids. Fatty acidesters make up the majority of these molecules, with fatty alcoholsmaking up the minority.FIGURE 8The structure of fatty acids from Ehretia species.FIGURE 9The structure of other compounds from Ehretia species.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359TABLE 3 Compounds from different parts of Ehretia genus by different identification methods.No. Compounds Species PartsusedIdentificationmethodsRef.Flavonoids1 Kampferol E. thyrsiflora Leaves 1D NMR; ESIMS Li et al.

A novelpyrrolizidine, 7-O-(p-methoxybenzoyl)-retronecanol (94) hasbeen isolated from E. aspera leaves (Suri et al., 1980). Ehretine(95) is a new alkaloid which having a cyclohex-2-en-1-one moiety(Chien et al., 2012). Simmondsin (96), ehretioside A1 (97),ehretioside A2 (98), ehretioside A3 (99) are four cyanoglucosideswhich were isolated from E. philippinensis bark (Simpol et al., 1994).4 Biological activity4.1 Antioxidant activityThe ethyl acetate (EA) extracts from the bark of E. acuminataexhibited potent antioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 22 μg/mL,26 μg/mL, and 140 μg/mL for ABTS, DPPH, and NO radicalscavenging assays, respectively (Table 4). In comparison, thestandard ascorbic acid (AA) had IC50 values of 28 μg/mL, 30 μg/mL, and 175 μg/mL, respectively. This suggests that the bark of thisplant possesses significant health benefits due to its antioxidantproperties, as supported by previous research (Kaur et al., 2019). TheEA extract from the fruit of E. acuminata also demonstrated strongfree radical scavenging capacity, as reported by Shukla group, withIC50 values of 40 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, and 380 μg/mL for ABTS,DPPH, and NO assays, respectively. For the same assays, thestandard AA had IC50 values of 23 μg/mL, 27 μg/mL, and230 μg/mL, respectively (Shukla et al., 2019b). Notably, the EAextract from the leaves of E. acuminata exhibited the highestantioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 90 μg/mL, 99 μg/mL, and250 μg/mL for ABTS, DPPH, and NO assays, respectively (Shuklaet al., 2019a). In vitro antioxidant and radical scavenging assaysconducted on E. serrata fruits and leaves revealed that the EAfraction of the leaf extract exhibited the highest activity. This isattributed to its high phenolic content. Additionally, the EA fractionof the fruit extract showed the highest lipid peroxidation value,followed by the leaf fraction. Significant free radical scavengingpotential was also observed in the chloroform (CH) and 1-butanolicfractions of the leaf extract (Zara et al., 2012). R28 cells were used toevaluate the protective effects of phytochemicals and ethanolicextracts from E. asperula leaves against oxidative stress-inducedretinal cell loss and excitotoxicity. The results indicated that both70% and 95% ethanolic leaf extracts enhanced cell viability underthese conditions. Furthermore, methyl rosmarinic acid (26) androsmarinic acid (27) were particularly effective in preventing retinalcell death and increasing ROS levels in cells exposed to glutamate/BSO-induced excitotoxicity/oxidative stress. These findings suggestthat E. asperula leaves may have therapeutic potential for treatingretinal degeneration (Le et al., 2021).The high phenolic content of E. macrophylla peel extracts is akey factor contributing to their remarkable antioxidant activity, asevidenced by PSC and ORAC values of 859.85 ± 70.32 μmol vit. Cequiv./g and 2877.01 ± 163.80 μmol trolox equiv./g, respectively (Lu,2016). According to Huma, there was a notable reduction in DPPHafter 60 min (94.1%) in the stem bark extract of E. serrata and30 min (85.01%) in the fruit extract of E. obtusifolia at the dosagelevel of 1,000 μg/mL (Huma, 2019).

The EA fractiondemonstrated strong antioxidant activity, with higher ORAC andPSC values compared to methyl caffeate (21) (He, 2018).Ehretiquinone (57), isolated from the root of E. longiflora,inhibited superoxide formation generated by N-formyl methionylleucyl phenylalanine (fMLP) with an IC50 value of 0.36 ± 0.03 μM(Chien et al., 2012).4.2 Anti-diabetic activityThe antidiabetic potential of various bark extracts of E.acuminata was evaluated in vitro using α-amylase and α-glycosidase inhibition assays. Among the tested extracts, only theCH extract demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against bothenzymes, with IC50 values of 43.35 μg/mL for α-amylase and42.90 μg/mL for α-glycosidase. These findings suggest that E.acuminata bark contains bioactive compounds with promisingantidiabetic property (Kaur et al., 2022). In a separate study,researchers investigated the effects of an aqueous extract of E.anacua leaves on alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Histologicalexamination of pancreatic tissues revealed that blood glucoselevels were significantly higher in diabetic rats compared to thecontrol group. Treatment with the aqueous extract at doses of 50,100, and 200 mg/kg reduced blood glucose levels and preservedpancreatic histoarchitecture. Microscopic examination of pancreatictissue showed significant architectural damage in the alloxan-treatedgroup, while the plant extract-treated group exhibited normalarchitecture. This indicates that the extract mitigates alloxan-induced toxicity. These results support the use of the extract as adietary supplement with hypoglycemic and antidiabetic activities forfunctional foods (Abimbola et al., 2021). The bioactive compoundsin E. cymosa leaves were also studied for their antidiabeticproperties. Methanol and EA fractions exhibited statisticallysignificant inhibition (P < 0.05) against α-amylase (IC50:2.11 mg/mL and 2.75 mg/mL, respectively) and α-glucosidase(IC50: 0.66 mg/mL and 0.60 mg/mL, respectively). Additionally,the methanol fraction inhibited α-amylase through a competitivemechanism and α-glucosidase through a noncompetitivemechanism. These findings suggest that E. cymosa leaves containbioactive compounds with therapeutic potential for diabetestreatment (Ogundajo and Ashafa, 2017). Antihyperglycemicefficacy of a 70% ethanolic fraction of the whole E. cymosa plantwas investigated in vivo using Sprague Dawley rats. Additional exvivo experiments were performed to determine the modulatoryeffects on the absorption of glucose in the intestines. Irrespectiveof the dosage, the extract substantially decreased the fasting bloodglucose level and equally reduced the amount of glucose absorbed bythe rat intestinal sacs. The findings validate the conventionalapplication of E. cymosa extract as a pharmaceutical treatmentfor diabetes in susceptible mice (Sarkodie et al., 2015). Phenoliccompounds from E. macrophylla fruit exhibited effectivehypoglycemic activity by inhibiting α-glucosidase and α-amylase,increasing glucose consumption and glycogen accumulation, andreducing G6Pase and PEPCK activity. Thus, E. macrophylla fruitshave the potential to enhance human health as metabolites infunctional foods, offering further health and economic benefitsTABLE 4 (Continued) Bioactivities attributed to the species of Ehretia genus.Bioactivities Species PartsusedExtract and/orcompoundsResults ReferenceModulation of gutmicrobiotaE. macrophylla Fruit Polysaccharide (EWMFP) The effects on human gut microbiota werestudied using an in vitro fermentation modelsimulating human colon micro-ecosystem.

(2012)Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org17Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359(Deng et al., 2020). E. tinifolia extracts showed no inhibitory effecton lipase but selectively inhibited α-glucosidase and α-amylase(Monroy-García et al., 2021). Sequential Soxhlet extraction of E.acuminata leaves yielded both nonpolar and polar extracts, whichwere evaluated for antidiabetic potential using spectrophotometricanalysis. The CH extract had the highest antidiabetic activity, withan IC50 ranging from 260 to 265 μg/mL (Shukla et al., 2021).4.3 Analgesic and anti-inflammatory activityThe volume of the paw edoema was substantially reduced in thecarrageenan- and formalin-induced rat paw edoema methods whenthe paw edoema was generated by the herbal hydrogel containingthe methanol extract of E. laevis leaves (HEL3). HEL3 exhibited78.75% and 79.51% inhibition, respectively, compared to thestandard indomethacin, which showed 80.24% and 81.12%inhibition at 360 min. HEL3 demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties (Memon et al.,2022). The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatoryproperties of the methanol extract of E. tinifolia (ETME) wereelucidated. ETME significantly increased total GSH levels anddecreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and NO production.Additionally, ETME reduced the production of pro-inflammatorycytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in response to LPS. Thestudy’s results suggest that ETME may be capable of protectingKupffer cells from NF-κB and MAPKs, as well as LPS-inducedoxidative stress and heightened inflammatory responses can bemitigated through the activation of the antioxidant pathwayinvolving Nrf2 and HO-1 (Lim et al., 2023). Thespectrophotometric technique was employed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of the leaf extracts (PE, CH, EA, EOL, andaqua) of E. acuminata. Shukla group reported that the EA extractexhibited the most potent anti-inflammatory activity (Shukla et al.,2021). When tested in vitro with hen egg albumin, the EA andethanol extracts of E. acuminata bark shown potent anti-inflammatory properties (IC50 values of 170 μg/mL and 172 μg/mL, respectively). According to the findings, the bark of E.acuminata contains chemicals that show promise as probableanti-inflammatory agents (Kaur et al., 2022). Compound 77,extracted from E. dicksonii, demonstrated a 43% inhibitory effecton TPA-exposed inflammation in the ears of mouse whenadministered at a dose of 500 μg. Compounds 78, 80, 81, 86 and84 exhibited potent activity with, IE500 μg of 32%, 19%, 39%, 63%,and 79%, respectively (Dong et al., 2000). Acetic acid-inducedwrithing and hot plate experiments, carrageenan-induced pawedoema, and cotton-pellet-exposed granuloma models wereemployed to evaluate the analgesic and anti-inflammatoryproperties of E. cymosa leaves. The findings of this investigationsubstantiate the conventional application of E. cymosa in themanagement of a diverse array of inflammatory and painfulconditions. Specifically, the 80% methanol, aqueous, EA, and CHextracts of the plant demonstrated substantial analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (Ashagrie et al., 2023). The four distinctsolvents (EA, n-butanol, CH, and PE) were used to extract thecompounds that were shown to be effective from the dried fruit of E.macrophylla after 70% ethanol was used. Strong anti-inflammatoryactivity was demonstrated by the EA and CH fractions, with IC50values for preventing NO release of 19.10 ± 0.31 μg/mL and 19.48 ±0.25 μg/mL, respectively.Methyl caffeate and methyl rosmarinate, two compounds thatwere extracted from E. macrophylla, showed better anti-inflammatory properties than the other four fractions; thesecompounds notably reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, andiNOS at 2 μg/mL and 1.25 μg/mL, respectively (He, 2018).Jyothirmai group demonstrated that the CH, methanolic, andaqueous extracts of E. laevis exhibited significant anti-inflammatory efficacy by reducing paw volume at varyingconcentrations (Jyothirmai et al., 2016). With the exception ofstem bark, E. serrata demonstrated a highly significant analgesiceffect at all dose levels (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg) over a 60-minperiod. The stem bark of E. obtusifolia exhibited highly significant(P < 0.01) results at all concentrations after 60 min. The anti-inflammatory effects of E. serrata and E. obtusifolia were found to behighly significant (P < 0.01) at all concentrations, including100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg, after two and 3 h(Huma, 2019).4.4 Hepatoprotective activityThe hepatoprotective effect of the hydroalcoholic (70% ethanol)and EA fractions of E. laevis flowers were evaluated using Wistarrats. Both extracts demonstrated significant dose-dependentprotection against alterations in serum aspartate ASAT, ALAT,ALP, and TP at oral doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg. Additionally,they provided dose-dependent protection against liver tissuemodifications, such as necrosis, fatty degeneration, and lymphaticinfiltration, induced by paracetamol. The EA fraction exhibitedsuperior activity compared to the hydroalcoholic extract. Thesefindings suggest that E. laevis extracts have promising potentialas preventive treatments for liver damage (Rangnathrao andShanmugasundaram, 2019). Similarly, the CH and EA extracts ofE. microphylla significantly protected rats from paracetamol-induced liver toxicities. Elevated levels of SGOT, SGPT, ALP,triglycerides, and total cholesterol in paracetamol-induced liverinjury were effectively reduced by pretreatment with E.microphylla extracts (CH and EA, 200 mg/kg), comparable tosilymarin (100 mg/kg). In summary, E. microphylla extractsdemonstrated substantial hepatoprotective benefits in the contextof paracetamol-induced liver injury in rats. The hepatoprotectiveproperties of E. microphylla may be attributed to the presence offlavonoids and phenolic compounds (Yuvaraja et al., 2021).4.5 Muscle relaxant andantispasmodic activityThe bark extracts of E. acuminata exhibited concentration-dependent increases in intestinal motility in experimentalanimals. These extracts also demonstrated antispasmodic,analgesic, and muscle relaxant activities at 300 mg/kg, with noobserved acute toxic effects in tested mice. Specifically, theantispasmodic activity was measured at 11 ± 1, 9 ± 1, and 11 ±1; analgesic activity at 10 ± 1, 16 ± 1, and 11 ± 1; and muscle relaxantactivity at 6 ± 1, 5 ± 1, and 5 ± 1. This study provides significantFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org18Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1526359evidence supporting the pharmacological use of E. acuminata as ananalgesic, antispasmodic, and muscle relaxant (Jan et al., 2023).Additionally, the methanolic extracts of the fruit, stem bark, andleaves of E. serrata and E. obtusifolia were evaluated forantispasmodic activity in Swiss albino rodents. The methanolicextract of the stem bark showed highly significant results (P <0.01) at concentrations of 200 and 300 mg/kg. E. obtusifoliaexhibited enhanced smooth muscle relaxation at low doses. Thehighly significant (P < 0.01) activities of the leaf (200 and300 mg/kg), fruit (300 mg/kg), and stem bark extracts (allconcentrations) scientifically validated their ethnopharmacologicaluse as antispasmodic agents (Huma, 2019).4.6 Antibacterial activityThe antibacterial potential of phytoconstituents was examinedby assessing their ability to disrupt bacterial cell permeability andinhibit bacterial growth. The methanolic extract of E. serrata leavesdemonstrated effective antibacterial activity against five testedbacteria, with ZOI ranging from 10.3 to 29.0 mm. The MICvalues ranged from 0.8 to 5.1 mg/mL (Waheed et al., 2019). TheCH, methanolic, and aqueous extracts of E. laevis exhibitedexceptional antibacterial efficacy against both gram-positive andgram-negative bacteria, with the methanolic fraction showing themost potent activity (Jyothirmai et al., 2016). Two compounds,prenylhydroquinone (47) and ehretiquinone (57), were isolatedfrom the methanolic fraction of E. longiflora root. Thesecompounds exhibited antitubercular effect inhibit Mycobacteriumtuberculosis strain H37Rv, with MIC values of 26.2 and 25.0 μg/mL,respectively (Chien et al., 2012). The ethanol extract of E. acuminataleaves exhibited the most extensive ZOI (12–18 mm) against variousfood poisoning bacteria (Shukla et al., 2021). The agar diffusionassay revealed that the 70% ethanolic fraction of the entire plant of E.cymosa inhibited P. aeruginosa, E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. aureus(Sarkodie et al., 2015). The extract exhibited inhibitory effect againstP. aeruginosa, E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. aureus (Sarkodie et al., 2015).The methanolic extract of E. serrata leaves exhibited a substantialantibacterial zone (7 mm) at a dosage level of 1,000 μg/mL, incontrast to the reference drug’s (31.5 mm). The leaf extract of E.obtusifolia exhibited a more potent antibacterial zone (7 mm) thanthe reference medication (30.2 mm) at a dosage level of 1,000 μg/mL(Huma, 2019).4.7 Anticancer activityThe leaves of E. laevis were utilized to synthesize sphericalsilver nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 25 to 35 nm.These nanoparticles exhibited potent anticancer activity,demonstrating high stability in solution and significantcytotoxicity. Specifically, the median lethal concentrations(LC50) for HeLa and MCF-7 cells were 12.7 μg/mL and14.5 μg/mL, respectively (Panja et al., 2020). The effectivecompounds were extracted from E. macrophylla fruit by 70%ethanol, and then extracted with four different solvents. The EAand CH fractions exhibited significant anti-proliferation activityin tested dosage. Methyl caffeate (21) demonstrated strongeranti-proliferation effect on Caco-2 cells (EC50 = 132.73 ±18.19 μM), while EC50 value of methyl caffeate onHepG2 cells (EC50 = 48.35 ± 0.61 μM) (He, 2018). E.microphylla (extract of leaves with flower buds) showed asignificant and highly selective antiproliferative effect oncancer cells (Kudera et al., 2021). At a concentration of 50 μg/mL, the CH extract of E. microphylla leaves inhibited MCF-7 andA-549 cancer cell lines by 85.55% and 77.93%, respectively. TheDAPI staining method was employed to investigate themechanism of cell death, which revealed alterations in nuclearmorphology in MCF-7 cell lines in the form of distinct changesthat were observed during the staining process (Sharma et al.,2022). The extract of the fruit of E. macrophylla showed dose-dependent antiproliferative activity, possibly influenced by thesynergistic and additive effects of individual phenolics (Denget al., 2020). Both E. tinifolia and Sideroxylon lanuginosumMichaux (Sapotaceae) exhibited antiproliferative activitiesagainst HeLa, HT-29 and MCF-7 cells (Monroy-Garcíaet al., 2021).4.8 Antihemolytic activityThe antihemolytic properties of the leaf extracts (PE, CH, EA,ethanol, and aqua) of E. acuminata were assessed usingspectrophotometric technique. The EA extract demonstrated themost potential for antihemolytic activity, with an IC50 of 90 μg/mL(Shukla et al., 2021). It was demonstrated that E. tinifoliapolyphenols had the ability to reduce hemolysis (IC50 = 58.55 ±2.4 μg/mL) (Monroy-García et al., 2021).4.9 Anti-arthritic activityThe methanolic extract of E. laevis leaves (500 mg/kg) in miceprevented paw edoema from increasing by 60% and by 56%, as perVelappan and Thangaraj (Velappan and Thangaraj, 2014).4.10 Wound healing activityWith healing times ranging from 7 days to a maximum of66 days, E. laevis leaves show considerable healing properties in bothinfected and non-infected, chronic and fresh wounds. Theseproperties become more effective as one ages. According to thestudy, the patient’s immune status remained unaffected because noantibiotics were administered (Thakre et al., 2016). The study alsoshowed that the CH fraction of the EtOH extract of E. Laevis has thesame wound-healing properties as Povidon iodine ointment inwistar rats (Harne et al., 2021). In 5% and 10% concentrations,the alcoholic extract ointment of C. retusa root, stem, and leaveswould be able to stimulate wound healing activity. Swiss albino micewere employed to test the effectiveness of wound healing. Theointment prepared from different fraction showed significanteffectiveness in wound contraction and faster wound closurecompared to the standard Nitrofurazone (0.2%) ointment. As aresult, the wound healing study demonstrated that C. retusa isavailable in facilitating wound closure (Mageswari et al., 2012).Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org19Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.15263594.11 Anti-amoebic activityThe leaves of Ampalaya (Momordica charantia L.) and TsaangGubat (E. microphylla) were processed to create a lyophilizedaqueous extract. Against Entamoeba histolytica, tsaang gubat andampalaya leaves did not show any anti-amoebic activity. In reality,they promoted the development of amoebae at all dose levels. TheIC50 of the extracts of tsaang gubat and ampalaya leaves was greaterthan 500 μg/mL at 24, 48, and 72 h. These findings contradict theconventional application of these herbal medicines to alleviatediarrhoea (Maramba-Lazarte et al., 2020). The leaves of E. laeviswere used to create the synthetic silver nanoparticles, whichdemonstrated larvicidal activity and efficient methylene blue dyedegradation. The nanoparticles were also extremely stable insolution and active. After being treated for 72 h, it killed 70% ±10.24% of Culex quinquefasciatus larvae at a dosage of 25 μg/mL.Within 8 h, the nanoparticles reduced Congo red by approximately85% at a concentration of 200 μg/mL. Furthermore, when exposed tosunlight, the produced nanoparticles may function as a waterpurifying agent (Panja et al., 2020).4.12 Lipoxygenase inhibitory activityCompounds 77, 81, 84 and 86 isolated from the fresh leaves andtwigs of E. dicksonii exhibited inhibitory effect against soybeanlipoxygenase at a concentration of 10 μg/mL (Dong et al., 2000).Compounds 24–27 and 29 demonstrated concentration-dependentinhibition of lipoxygenase, with Ki values ranging from 0.85 to57.6 μM. Compounds 26 and 27 were the most potent, having Kivalues of 0.85 μM and 1.0 μM, respectively. Compounds 25–27 and29 exhibited noncompetitive inhibition, whereas compound 24 wasclassified as an uncompetitive inhibitor of lipoxygenase (Iqbalet al., 2005).4.13 Modulation of gut microbiotaA new polysaccharide called EWMFP was effectively isolated andidentified from E. macrophylla fruit by Xu group. The impacts on thegastrointestinal microbiota of humans were investigated using anin vitro fermentation model that reproduces the micro-ecosystem ofthe human colon. With a molecular weight of 12.45 KDa, EWMFP ismade up of fourmonosaccharides and is better than inulin at preservingmicrobial diversity. By the end of fermentation, EWMFP produces ahigher concentration of butyrate than inulin and can modify thecomposition of gut microbes in a different way. Differing routesmay lead to differing compositions of short chain fatty acids (SCFA)during fermentation between EWMFP and inulin. According to theirresearch, EWMFP may have a new role as a prebiotic in controllingcolonic health (Deng et al., 2020).4.14 Other activitiesErhetianone (56), which was isolated from a methanolicpreparation of the root bark of E. buxifolia, has been shown tohave antisnake venom activity against the venom of Echis carinatusin rodents. The antisnake venom effect of compound 56 wasdetermined by calculating the LD50 of E. carinatus venom inmice that was administered subcutaneously (Selvanayagam et al.,1996). It was discovered that the butanolic and EA extracts of E.philippinensis bark exhibited anti-histamine releasing activity(Simpol et al., 1994). The objective of this work was toinvestigate the impact of E. microphylla on the quantity ofovarian surface follicles, relative weight of the ovaries and uterus,and folliculogenesis in female Wistar albino rats. Hematologyrequired the removal of the uterus and ovaries. The findingsshow that 1,000 mg/kg of powdered E. microphylla increased thelevels of FSH, LH, and estradiol significantly. Additionally, increasedfolliculogenesis was found along with increased ovarian and uterineweight. As a result, the results point to a noteworthy stimulatingeffect on female reproductive function that might improve adultfemale rats’ fertility (Aarthi et al., 2012).5 ToxicologyThe alcoholic extract from E. microphylla leaves did not exhibitany chromosome-fragmentation generating activity in themutagenicity or genotoxicity assays (Balboa and Sylianco, 1993;Legaspi and Bagaoisan, 2020). Only one report on acute oral toxicityfor E. laevis adheres to the OECD recommendation of 423. All of themethanolic extracts from the fruits, stems, and foliage in thisinvestigation were determined to be safe at a dosage of2,000 mg/kg (Sharma et al., 2021; Velappan and Thangaraj,2014). The safety and effectiveness of E. laevis and E. microphyllaextracts and fractions for a range of illnesses are not adequatelysupported by the few and inadequate toxicity reports that arecurrently available. Moreover, there is a dearth of information inthe literature regarding this genus’s toxicity.6 Clinical studiesThe tsaang gubat tablets contains a 10% leaf aqueous extract thathas been shown to be both safe and efficacious in the treatment ofgastrointestinal and biliary colic pain. In a Phase II clinical trialconducted in Pila and Victoria, Laguna, the formulation wasadministered to five male patients who were diagnosed withacute colic due to lax bowel movements. The following effectswere observed after the treatment: (1) all patients reportedexperiencing relief from intestinal spasms or colic, and (2) theonset of colic relief typically occurred 20–30 min after thedosage. Efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability of the tsaang gubattablet at a dose of 150 mg/kg were comparable to those ofdicycloverine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg in Phase II clinical trialsconducted at the Tarlac Provincial Hospital. The patients were110 outpatients with acute mild, moderate, or severe biliary colic.The laboratory tests conducted subsequent to the administration ofthe tsaang gubat tablet did not reveal any abnormalities, and thepatients reported no adverse effects (Legaspi and Bagaoisan, 2020).It has been registered with the Philippine Food and DrugAdministration, is currently listed in the Philippine NationalFormulary and has been licensed to a limited number of localpharmaceutical enterprises.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org20Jiang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.15263597 Cultivation and commercial valueIn recent years, there are more and more reports about thecultivation of this genus with the development and utilization ofsome plants of Ehretia genus. It is mainly divided into threecultivation methods. The first one is seed cultivation. The plant fruitbegins in ripe and can be collected centrally when the fruit changes fromgreen to orange-red or yellow. The fruit was peeled and stratified afterharvest. The seeds are sprouted and sown when the soil thaws in thefollowing spring. The other two methods are root and branch cottage(Huma, 2019; Zhou, et al., 2012). As a kind of Kudingcha, the leaves of E.thyrsiflora have great commercial value as a health tea in China (WangandHuang, 2005). Furthermore, Tupipa (the fruit ofE.macrophylla) hasbeen developed as a new food in Hengnan County, China, to promotelocal economic development and help rural revitalization. Up to now,the county planting area of more than 30,000 mus and the sales ofTupipa products reached 100million yuan in 2023 (http://lyj.hunan.gov.cn/). E. tinifolia produces small, globe-shaped yellow drupes measuringup to 8 mm in diameter. These fruits have a sweet taste and have beenutilized as both food and medicinal plants in various regions of Mexicoand the United States (Monroy-García et al., 2021). E. microphylla isconsidered the most promising species for large-scale production and isused extensively in traditional Philippine medicine. Based on thefindings of early experiments, recommendations were made on thecultivation, harvesting, and storage (where applicable) of vegetativepropagation (Mageswari and Karpagam, 2015). Some plants ofEhretia genus are often used as herb medicine, food, street tree andyard planting, so the cultivation and commercial value of this genus havecertain reference value.8 Conclusion and perspectivesThe biology, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology,toxicity, clinical studies, cultivation and commercial value of the Ehretiagenus were summarized in this paper. This genus is widely distributedacross various regions, with some species being particularly diverse. Ithas been extensively utilized in traditional medicine and food practices.Although there are commonalities in medicinal applications, these varysignificantly depending on the species and geographical location. In fact,Ehretia species are used to treat skin conditions, pain and inflammation,and digestive issues in many different countries. Numerouspharmacological activities, including the antioxidant, anti-diabetic,and anti-inflammatory characteristics, have been studied in vivo andin vitro in several species. While most studies have concentrated oncrude extracts, certain active compounds have also been evaluated.There is evidence that flavonoids and phenylpropanoids haveantioxidant properties.In Asian countries, ethnic populations employ E. leavis asmasticatories. Undiscovered wound-healing properties have beenshown by E. leavis. The finest aspect is that it produces a lot ofmaterial without requiring the plant to be uprooted since its leavesare effective. Indian scientists have conducted several studies to enhancethe germination of multifunctional trees such as E. leavis. To learn moreabout the characteristics of the genusEhretia, molecular studies have alsobeen conducted on a few species. E. tinifolia has recently been the subjectof study that indicates beneficial responses against cardiovascularillnesses, atherosclerosis, and diabetes problems (Panja et al., 2020).However, many questions remain regarding our comprehensiveunderstanding of the Ehretia genus, necessitating further research. First,given their historical applications, certain species warrant more in-depthinvestigation. Notably, E. microphylla is extensively used in China, India,and the Philippines to treat gastrointestinal and biliary colic, diarrhea,spasms, and inflammation. Studies on this species’ antispasmodicactivity have revealed its antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antibacterial,anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, and wound-healingproperties. These findings may lead to the discovery of novelbioactive compounds. Therefore, additional research should focus ontraditionally used plants that have been overlooked but offer clearbenefits. Second, despite limited documentation of traditional usagefor most species within this genus, abundant resources allow forcontinued scientific exploration into these species.Thirdly, despite the fact that extracts from a number of Ehretiaspecies have shown strong activity, comparatively few of the chemicalscausing these effects have been found in relation to the number ofpharmacological investigations that have been carried out. For instance,E. anacua is said to exhibit strong anti-diabetic effects in vivo; yet, thisplant’s secondary compounds have not been found. Therefore, bio-guided isolation should be used to identify the bioactive compoundsfrom these species. Moreover, there is a great chance of finding novelactive chemicals in the genus Ehretia because of its high degree ofendemism. Lastly, although systematic study is still lacking, research onthis species focuses mostly on the investigation of its chemicals andbiological activity. Establishing quality standards and conducting morecomplete investigations are vital for future studies to guarantee theintegrity and efficacy of the findings pertaining to this genus. It isrecommended to add techniques or approaches that can address thesegaps in the future research (e.g., metabolomics, high-throughputscreening, HPLC-MS). Furthermore, some of the literatures are nothigh-level papers, and the experimental data can only be usedfor reference.In conclusion, further research is required because thephytochemistry and pharmacology of the Ehretia genus have notbeen thoroughly examined. To date, 101 compounds have beenidentified from this genus, with phenylpropanoids being the mostactive class. Rosmarinic acid showed different strong activity in thisgenus. Several species’ medicinal potential has been highlighted bynumerous biological investigations, providing a strong basis for furtherinvestigation. It is imperative that further research be carried out in vivowith suitable dosage levels and controls. To guarantee safety andeffectiveness, the side effects connected to the effective doses shouldalso be thoroughly assessed. Given the rich resource base and significantmedical value of this genus, continued research is warranted. This papercontributes scientific value to the ongoing development of the genus.Author contributionsSJ: Writing–original draft, Writing–review and editing. MW:Writing–original draft.
