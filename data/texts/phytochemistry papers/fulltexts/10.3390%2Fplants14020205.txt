However,scientific research on this genus remains limited, highlighting the need for a comprehensivereview of its chemical composition and pharmacological characteristics. This review com-piles existing knowledge on Chiliadenus species, focusing on their secondary metabolites,such as flavonoids, terpenes, and essential oils, as well as associated biological activi-ties. The findings show that the traditional therapeutic properties of Chiliadenus are wellsupported by reported pharmacological activities in previous studies, emphasizing thepotential of this genus for the development of new therapeutic agents. However, thelack of comparative studies among Chiliadenus species and the scarcity of in vivo stud-ies and clinical trials hinder the full realization of its therapeutic potential. Specifically,comparative studies could be key to identifying species with unique chemical profilesand understanding how variations in secondary metabolite composition may influencetheir pharmacological activities. This work highlights the urgent need to expand researchin these areas to validate the pharmacological properties of Chiliadenus species for theirapplication in modern medicine.Keywords: Chiliadenus; Jasonia; folk medicine; bioactive compounds; biological activities1. IntroductionNatural products have persisted as an inexhaustible source of bioactive moleculeswith a structural diversity that far exceeds that of conventional synthetic compounds.Throughout history, these compounds have played an essential role in the discovery of newand interesting drugs, as their complex chemical structures—often unsuspected—haveproven to be highly effective in the treatment of numerous diseases. In fact, it is estimatedthat more than 50% of the medicines approved in recent decades are directly or indirectlyderived from natural products, underlining the importance of exploring the world’s florato identify new chemical entities with therapeutic potential [1].The ability of natural products to interact selectively with specific proteins has beenone of the key factors that make them so valuable in drug discovery. In contrast to syntheticcompounds, natural products tend to exhibit greater molecular rigidity and structuralcomplexity, resulting in more specific and potent biological interactions. In addition, therichness in carbon and oxygen atoms of these molecules, together with a lower contentof nitrogen atoms and halogens, suggests a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, withfewer adverse effects and better bioavailability. In this context, ethnopharmacology, asPlants 2025, 14, 205 https://doi.org/10.3390/plants14020205Plants 2025, 14, 205 2 of 42a discipline that studies the traditional use of medicinal plants, has established itselfas an indispensable tool to guide the search for new drugs. The correlation betweentraditional uses and modern pharmacological activities is remarkable; one study foundthat 80% of plant-derived compounds used therapeutically have therapeutic indicationsconsistent with their ethnopharmacological use. This finding highlights the validity oftraditional knowledge as a starting point for pharmacological research and the importanceof systematically documenting and analyzing ancestral medicinal practices [1].The Asteraceae family, with more than 25,000 species distributed globally, stands outas one of the most prolific botanical families in terms of the production of bioactive com-pounds. Many of the species are widely used in traditional medicine and have been animportant source of bioactive compounds that have led to the development of pharmaceu-ticals. One of the most notable examples is artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone extractedfrom Artemisia annua, which revolutionized the treatment of malaria. In addition, otherspecies have been shown to possess a wide range of therapeutic properties, includinganti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, antiprotozoal, hepatoprotective, wound-healingand antitumor properties, among many others [2]. Today, the Asteraceae family remains aninvaluable source of chemical biodiversity, with great potential for the advancement of newindustries, supported both for the traditional employment of its species or for scientificstudies confirming their diverse therapeutic properties.The Asteraceae family is the biggest family of blooming plants. It involves around1600 genera as well as about 25,000 species distributed worldwide (https://wfoplantlist.org/). Within this family, Chiliadenus Cass (tribe Inuleae) is a small genus consisting of10 species, many of which have been widely used in traditional medicine for different ther-apeutic purposes in countries of the Mediterranean area. These species, mainly distributedin arid and semi-arid areas, have been used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflam-matory conditions, infections and digestive disorders. However, despite their therapeuticpotential, scientific knowledge about the chemical and pharmacological properties of Chili-adenus species is still limited. Work on the genus Chiliadenus has documented the presenceof several classes of bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, terpenes and essential oils,which may be responsible for its therapeutic effects.From a taxonomic point of view, the species of this genus used to be included in JasoniaCass and/or Varthemia DC, although Brullo (1979) transferred them to the genus Chiliadenus,supported by their structure, but not all authors have considered these synonymies intheir works.In 2020, Shaaban et al. published a review of the chemical components isolated fromthe different species of the genus Chiliadenus [3]; however, this review does not take intoaccount the synonymies between the genera Chiliadenus and Jasonia, which could lead to anomission of relevant data on the compounds and their biological activity, and consequentlyto an underestimation of the pharmacological potential of these plants.Despite the recognized chemical and biological diversity of the genus Chiliadenus,there is a notable lack of comparative studies that systematically assess the differencesand similarities between the species that comprise it. This lack of research has limited thecomprehensive understanding of the genus, as most studies have focused on individualspecies, without establishing comparisons that could reveal key biological or chemicalpatterns. Such a comparative approach could be crucial in identifying species with uniquechemical profiles, and to understand how variations in secondary metabolite compositionmay influence their respective pharmacological activities. Furthermore, despite the ther-apeutic potential suggested by in vitro studies and traditional use of Chiliadenus, there isa worrying paucity of work that has progressed to in vivo models or clinical trials. Thisgap in clinical research not only limits the scientific validation of ethnopharmacologicalPlants 2025, 14, 205 3 of 42uses, but also hinders the potential development of new drugs based on the bioactivecompounds of this genus. Clinical screening is essential to determine the efficacy, safetyand appropriate dosage of Chiliadenus extracts and isolated compounds, which are essentialsteps before any application in modern medicine can be considered.Given the increasing importance of ethnopharmacological studies in the identificationof new drugs and the underestimated potential of Chiliadenus species, this work aimsto comprehensively review the ethnopharmacological data, chemical composition andbiological activity of extracts and compounds isolated from the different species of thisgenus. This review aims to provide a broader and deeper understanding of these medicinalplants, offering a solid basis for future research that may lead to the discovery of newtherapeutic agents derived from Chiliadenus.2. MethodologyTo analyze the traditional uses, phytochemical aspects, and biological activity ofplants from the Chiliadenus genus, a comprehensive bibliographic review was conductedusing various online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect,SciFinder, Wiley Online Library, ACS, SpringerLink, and Google Scholar. The search wasdesigned to identify all available studies related to Chiliadenus and Jasonia genera, as wellas their synonymies.Search Terms and DescriptorsThe following primary search terms were used to ensure comprehensive coverageof the topic: Chiliadenus, Jasonia. These terms were used in combination to locate allpublications related to these genera, including studies on species that are synonymouslyclassified under both genera. Furthermore, additional search terms were used to ensurethat relevant studies on synonymously related species were not omitted. These include:Inula, Erigeron and specific species: Inula saxatilis and Erigeron glutinosus (known synonymsof Chiliadenus and Jasonia species).To include information on the taxonomic classification and potential synonymies,searches were also performed using alternative taxonomic names, such as Varthemia montanaand Varthemia iphionoides for Chiliadenus montanus and Chiliadenus iphionoides, respectively,based on their former classification.Additionally, other search terms related to the chemical composition and biologicalactivity of the plants were included: Traditional uses, Chemical composition and Pharma-cological activity.The following inclusion criteria were applied to select relevant articles:- Studies discussing the taxonomic classification of Chiliadenus and its synonymieswith Jasonia.- Publications that provide detailed information on the chemical composition, phy-tochemical properties, and bioactive compounds isolated from Chiliadenus andrelated species.- Articles examining the pharmacological activities of Chiliadenus species, includingin vitro studies, clinical studies, or ethnopharmacological reviews.- Studies focusing on traditional uses of Chiliadenus species in medicinal practices.Exclusion criteria included:- Articles not related to the species of Chiliadenus, Jasonia, or their known synonyms.- Studies that focused on non-ethnopharmacological uses or did not provide sufficientdata on chemical or pharmacological properties.Plants 2025, 14, 205 4 of 42Database Search and Article SelectionTo ensure a comprehensive review of the literature, no time limits were set for thesearch years, allowing the inclusion of both recent and older studies. After applyingthe inclusion and exclusion criteria, articles that provided sufficient data on the taxon-omy, chemical composition, traditional uses, and pharmacological activity of the specieswere selected.To guarantee the accuracy of the taxonomic classification and synonymies, globaldatabases, such as the World Flora Online Plant List (WFO) and the Plants of the WorldOnline (POWO), maintained by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, were consulted. Theseresources provided up-to-date and authoritative information on the plant species discussed,including the correct taxonomic names and synonymies.3. Taxonomic Considerations on the Genus Chiliadenus and ItsRelationship to the Genus JasoniaThe genus Jasonia is included in the tribe Inuleae, a complex group of species belongingto the family Asteraceae. French botanist Alexandre de Cassini first described this genus.About 20 species were included, including Jasonia longifolia Cass., Jasonia radiata Cass. andJasonia tuberosa (L.) DC. Jasonia glutinosa has been classified in the genus Chiliadenus, asChiliadenus glutinosus (L.) Fourr. with the following synonymies: Jasonia glutinosa var.glutinosa, Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC., Chiliadenus saxatilis (Lam.) Brullo, Jasonia saxatilis (Lam.)Guss., Chiliadenus camphoratus Cass. and Inula saxatilis Lam. [Global Compositae Checklist(GCC, www.compositae.org/checklist, accessed on 19 August 2024)]. Alexandre de Cassinilater described the genus Chiliadenus for the first time to replace that of its former genusMyriadenus Cass. Cassini includes the genus Chiliadenus within the tribe Inuleae, orderAsterales, family Asteraceae, and this is integrated by ten species from selected regionsof the Mediterranean zone [4].

Brullo Jasonia sericea Batt. and Trab.Varthemia sericea (Batt. and Trab.) DielsCassini initially described the genera Jasonia and Chiliadenus separately, but latertaxonomic revisions led to the reclassification of some species. In many cases, speciesoriginally described within the genus Jasonia were transferred to the genus Chiliadenus.In 1836, De Candolle grouped four sections under the genus Jasonia, two of whichcorrespond to Chiliadenus (with Jasonia glutinosa) and Eujasonia (with Jasonia tuberosa andJasonia sicula) [5]. Later, in 1979, Brullo, in his work on the genus Chiliadenus, recognizednine species, excluding Jasonia tuberosa. Brullo argued that these species should not beincluded in the genus Jasonia Cass., but rather should be assigned to the genus ChiliadenusCass., which differs significantly from the former by the absence of ligulate flowers andthe presence of achenes covered in glands and hairs. Upon reviewing numerous herbar-ium specimens of Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC. from various locations, including the IberianPeninsula, Lampedusa, Malta, the Balearic Islands, Morocco, and France, Brullo foundnotable differences between the Franco-Iberian and Maltese plants, particularly in thestem shape, hair distribution, capitula arrangement on the scape, leaf structure, achenes,and involucre bracts. These distinctions confirmed that they were two separate species,revealing a confusing situation concerning their nomenclature. In addition to Chiliadenussaxatilis, with a distribution area from the south of France, Mallorca, Spain and Morocco, itconsiders as new species the populations of Malta (Chiliadenus bocconei) and Lampedusa(Chiliadenus lopadusanus). It also includes Chiliadenus candicans (Delile) Brullo from thenorthern coast of Egypt, Chiliadenus montanus (Vahl) Brullo from the Sinai Peninsula, andChiliadenus iphionoides (Boiss. and Blanche) Brullo from Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon,which were considered as a separate genus, Varthemia (Varthemia montana (Vahl) Boiss.,Varthemia candicans (Delile) Boiss. and Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. and Blanche in Boiss.From these investigations, Brullo concludes that the genus Jasonia is monotypic andis depicted by J. tuberosa (L.) DC. (Erigeron tuberosum L.) and, on the other hand, thegenus Chiliadenus includes these other types: Chiliadenus bocconei Brullo sp. nov. (Orsinacamphorata Bertol. pp.), Chiliadenus saxatilis (Lam.) Brullo comb. nov. (Inula saxatilisLam.), Chiliadenus candicans (Delile) Brullo comb. nov. (Varthemia candicans [Delile] Boiss.),Chiliadenus lopadusanus Brullo sp. nov., Chiliadenus montanus (Vahl) Brullo comb. nov.(Varthemia montana [Vahl] Boiss.), Chiliadenus iphionoides (Boiss. and Blanche) Brullo comb.nov.

(Jasonia sericea Batt. and Trabut), Chiliadenus rupestris (Pomel) Brullocomb. nov. (Jasonia rupestris Pomel) (Table 1) [6].According to the criterion proposed by Brullo, J. glutinosa and J. tuberosa belongto different genera and, in this sense, with respect to the former, he considers it moreappropriate to include it within the genus Chiliadenus Cass, under the name Chiliadenussaxatilis (Lam.) Brullo, since its capitula have only flosculose flowers, as well as acheneswith a setae pappus with a single row of hairs, characteristics that he considers of greattaxonomic importance and justify its inclusion in a genus different from Jasonia [7].However, in 2004, Pardo de Santayana proposed the inclusion of this plant in thegenus Jasonia, since he considers that the characteristics indicated by Brullo (1979) for thedivision of these two genera are not significant [8]. Scientific names of plants, based onbinomial nomenclature, are often revised and adjusted as additional research is conductedand evolutionary relationships among species are better understood. In 2018, Bengtsonet al. conducted a molecular phylogenetic study, as well as a biogeographical analysis ofthe different species composing the genus Chiliadenus, which led to the confirmation ofthe monophyletic character of this genus and of its divergence from the genus Dittrichia,dispersing across the Mediterranean to its current distribution [9]. In view of this confir-mation, this work aims to carry out an exhaustive review of the botanical characteristics,geographic distribution, traditional uses, chemical composition and biological activities ofthe different species that make up the genus Chiliadenus.4.

Chiliadenus glutinosusC. glutinosus (L.) Fourr. [J. glutinosa (L.) DC, J. saxatilis (Lam) Guss, C. saxatilis (Lam.)Brullo, Erigeron glutinosus L., Inula saxatilis Lam] is a species popularly known as “rocktea” or “Aragon tea”. It is the only species of the genus Chiliadenus that grows in Spain,distributed in the island of Mallorca, in Levante and extending to north Morocco andthe south of France (Figure 1A) [6,8,11]. It lives exclusively in fissures and landings ofvertical calcareous rocks or in horizontal crevices, generally below 1300 m in altitude [8].It is a perennial plant, about 60 cm high, with plenty of trichomes, several of which areshort glandular and others long non-secretory, with a branched or simple stem and aslender rhizome with narrow and long roots that hide among rocks. Its leaves are alternate,lanceolate, small, sharp, erect, entire or rarely toothed, and are covered with glandular hairs.The flower heads are grouped in cymose or corymbose inflorescences and occasionallyisolated. The involucre has bracts arranged in several rows. In each flower head thereare numerous yellow florets (Figure 2A). The pappus shows two lines of hairs. Floweringoccurs from May to October, mainly between July and August [12–14]. It should beharvested in these months when the plant is flowering; the flowering aerial part is easilycollected by breaking the stems, leaving the base intact. It is quite abundant and, despiteintensive harvesting, natural populations are not endangered [15].4.1.1. Traditional UsesThe first information on the use of this plant dates back to 1867 and, at present, it isone of the most popular and widely used medicinal species in the Iberian Peninsula. It isused in infusion and has a camphorated aroma and a slightly bitter taste [8]. In the placeswhere it grows, C. glutinosus has a known and widespread reputation for its broad varietyof medicinal uses, especially in Spain [8,12]. It is used mainly to treat digestive pathologies(stomach pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, gastric ulcers, vomiting, etc,) and respiratory (sorethroat, asthmatic processes and respiratory infections), for the treatment of circulatorydisorders (arterial hypertension, varicose veins), genitourinary disorders(as a diuretic andto treat pain due to kidney stones, etc.), as well as in musculoskeletal disorders (rheumaticdiseases and joint pain, bone, etc.) and nervous system (as a tranquilizer and analgesic). Inaddition to these internal uses, it is also used topically, in the form of infusion or decoctionin alcohol, in the treatment of skin disorders, for washing and disinfecting injuries, and inthe form of a poultice to be applied to wounds and burns [8,16].This plant has a long tradition of use in Catalonia (Spain) to prepare a liqueur called“ratafía”, which is made with brandy and other medicinal plants, together with lemonpeel and spices, such as nutmeg, cloves and mint. It is consumed mainly as a digestivePlants 2025, 14, 205 8 of 42after meals to relieve digestive disorders and other minor problems, and as an aperitif tostimulate appetite [8].The results of a study conducted in Navarre (Spain) on ethnobotanical knowledge ofthe region’s medicinal plants show that C. glutinosus is one of the species with the highestnumber of citations and a long tradition of use [17]. Subsequently, the same research groupconducted an ethnopharmacological study on the medicinal plants used in Navarre for thetreatment of neurological and mental disorders. The authors highlight the infusion of theaerial part of this species, for which the most reported applications were “to clear the mind”and in “headache”. This study underlines the importance of traditional knowledge of theuse of medicinal plants and provides a basis for future scientific research that could validateand explain the mechanisms of action of this species in the treatment of neurological andmental disorders [8,18].These effects on the central nervous system could be related, in part, to the antioxidantaction demonstrated for this species. Antioxidant properties can protect cells from damagecaused by free radicals, which are involved in oxidative stress, which, in turn, is associatedwith various neurological and mental disorders, as well as headaches. The antioxidantaction may help reduce inflammation and protect the nervous system, improve brainfunction and relieve pain. On the other hand, inflammation and oxidative stress areassociated with the aging progress as a causative factor in neurodegeneration among otherpathologies [18].Alarcón et al. (2015) conducted a study whose objective was to contribute to theunderstanding of the local and traditional use of plants in the Basque Country (Spain), aregion that preserves a rich heritage in the employment of medicinal herbs. One of themost frequently reported species in this study is C. glutinosus. An infusion of this species isthe most popular tea and has great importance in the local phytotherapy [19].4.1.2. PhytochemistryC. glutinosus has been studied by researchers all over the world, but most researchhas been conducted in Spain. Phytochemical studies have conducted on the aerial partof the plant, since it is that part traditionally used in folk medicine. Generally, the plantis extracted once dried, except when investigating the composition of the essential oil, inwhich case the fresh plant is used and extracted by hydro-distillation. The extraction ofthe non-volatile components of the plant is carried out using different methods, generallymaceration at room temperature, and the solvents used are varied depending on the type ofcomponents to be extracted. Methanol, ethanol, hydroalcoholic mixtures, acetone or apolarsolvents, such as benzene or dichloromethane, have been used. A large number of differentchemical compounds have been identified in this species to date, mainly belonging to thegroup of phenolic compounds and terpenes (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) (Table 2).For consistency with the existing literature and for ease of understanding, we willuse the name J. glutinosa if studies have been published using that name. By using thename under which the articles have been published, we seek to ensure greater clarity andprecision in the discussion of the data and findings in the bibliography.The total polyphenol content is high, although it should be noted that there arevariations, as it is influenced by the solvent used for extraction, being more abundant inhydroalcoholic extracts.Plants 2025, 14, 205 9 of 42Table 2.

Their structures wereestablished on the basis of the UV (ultraviolet) spectral data, TLC (Thin Layer Chro-matography), and 1H, 13C NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance). The flavonoids werepatuletin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), patuletin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside (4) and quercetin-7-O-monoglucoside (5) (Figure 3). The presence of methoxylated flavonoids allowed us toraise some chemotaxonomic hypotheses, since these compounds had not been describedthus far in the genus Jasonia [20]. Likewise, in the butanolic extract of the aerial part, theflavanol glucuronides kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (6), quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (7) and kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside-6”-methyl ester(8) were identified (Figure 3) [21].Other products present in this plant have also been of interest. The sesquiterpene com-pounds of the eudesmanolide family have attracted the attention of numerous researchersbecause of their diverse range of particularly significant biological activities. In 1978,Pascual Teresa et al. isolated and identified (−)-[11R]-4α-hydroxy-eudesm-11,12-diol (kudt-diol) (9), a bicyclic sesquiterpene alcohol [22], and more identifications would follow. In1980, three sesquiterpene alcohols were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by spec-troscopic methods and chemical correlations as (−)-[11R]-4α,14-epoxyeudesm-11,12-diol(10), (−)-[11R]-eudesm-4(14)-en-5β,11,12-triol (11) and (+)-[11R]-eudesm-4(14)-en-5α,11,12-triol (12) and they are called α-epoxy kudtdiol, 5-epi-kudtriol and kudtriol, respectively(Figure 4) [23].Plants 2025, 14, 205 10 of 42Plants 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 43   5β, ll,12-trihydroxy-iphionan-4-one (lucinone) (13) [24] (2R)-2-methyl-2-(4-oxopentyl)-5-(1-methyl-1,2-dihydroxyethyl) cyclohexanone (glutinone) (14) [24] (11 R)-eudesm -4-en-11,12-diol (15) [25] (11 R)-eudesmane-5α,11,12-triol (16) [25] The total polyphenol content is high, although it should be noted that there are vari-ations, as it is influenced by the solvent used for extraction, being more abundant in hy-droalcoholic extracts. In 1995, our research group described the presence of five flavonoids from the CH3OH/H2O (60/40) extract of the aerial part of J. glutinosa. Their structures were estab-lished on the basis of the UV (ultraviolet) spectral data, TLC (Thin Layer Chromatog-raphy), and 1H, 13C NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance). The flavonoids were patuletin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), patuletin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside (4) and quercetin-7-O-monoglucoside (5) (Figure 3). The presence of methoxylated flavonoids allowed us to raise some chemotaxonomic hypotheses, since these compounds had not been described thus far in the genus Jasonia [20]. Likewise, in the butanolic extract of the aerial part, the fla-vanol glucuronides kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (6), quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (7) and kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside-6”-methyl ester (8) were identified (Figure 3) [21].  Figure 3. Chemical structure of the flavonoids isolated from J. glutinosa (C. glutinosus) (1–8). Other products present in this plant have also been of interest. The sesquiterpene compounds of the eudesmanolide family have attracted the attention of numerous re-searchers because of their diverse range of particularly significant biological activities. In 1978, Pascual Teresa et al. isolated and identified (−)-[11R]-4α-hydroxy-eudesm-11,12-diol (kudtdiol) (9), a bicyclic sesquiterpene alcohol [22], and more identifications would fol-low.

Chemical structure of the flavonoids isolated from J. glutinosa (C. glutinosus) (1–8).In 2000, kudtriol and 5-epi-kudtriol, as well as their epimers at position 11, were syn-thesized in the laboratory from 1-α-santonin 4 using Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylationas the key reaction. By comparing the spectral data of the natural triols and the syntheticsamples, the absolute configuration of the natural triols could be confirmed [26].From a CH2Cl2 extract of J. glutinosa our research team isolated and characterizedtwo new eudesmanolide-type sesquiterpenes, 5β,ll,12-trihydroxy-iphionan-4-one (luci-none) (13) and (2R)-2-methyl-2-(4-oxopentyl)-5-(1-methyl-1,2-dihydroxyethyl) cyclohex-anone (glutinone) (14) not identified so far in any other species (Figure 4). In this case, thealcohols are not actually alcohol but ketone derivatives. Their i entification was carriedout by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques [FAB MS (Fast Atom BombardmentMass Spectrometry), 1D and 2D NMR (One-Dimensional and two-Dimensional NMR):COSY (COrrelation SpectroscopY), HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence)and HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation)] [24].In 2001, Chiu et al. developed enantioselective methods for the total chemical synthe-sis of lucinone, which represented a significant challenge in asymmetric synthesis. Thisbreakthrough not only confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural sesquiterpenesbut also paved the way for the creation of new derivatives with potential bioactive applica-tions [27]. That same year, Zhang et al. successfully synthesized glutinone for the first time,along with its epimers at positions C(7) and C(11), further advancing the understanding ofthese compounds [28].Continuing with the study of the terpenic compounds present in this species, ourresearch group isolated and identified two new sesquiterpene alcohol eudesmanolides fromthe acetone/water extract of the aerial part. This extract was fractionated by open columnchromatography and, after further purification by medium pressure liquid chromatography(MPLC), the two compounds were obtained and identified by 1D and 2D NMR spectro-scopic techniques [DQCOSY (Double Quantum Correlation Spectroscopy), TOCSY (TotalCorrelation Spectroscopy), NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy), HMQC andHMBC] as (11 R)-eudesm -4-en-11,12-diol (15) and (11 R)-eudesmane-5α,11,12-triol (16)(Figure 4) [25].Plants 2025, 14, 205 11 of 42Plants 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 43    Figure 4. Chemical structure of the sesquiterpenes isolated from J. glutinosa (C. glutinosus) (9–16). In our laboratory, we also studied the essential oil of the fresh leaves of J. glutinosa. In this case, extraction was performed by distillation in a modified Clevenger apparatus with a water-cooled oil receiver to reduce artifact formation. The oil was examined by GC–MS. On the other hand, an analysis was conducted by direct thermal desorption (DTD) coupled to GC–MS. Thirty-four components were identified in the essential oil. The main constituents were camphor, borneol, caryophyllene oxide, farnesol and bornyl for-mate. In addition, cadinol and spatulenol were identified by DTD. Many of these com-pounds were first described in the essences of this species. After comparing the two meth-ods used, it was observed that the DTD technique had the advantage of requiring less sample and allowing the subsequent identification of a larger quantity of volatile com-pounds by GC–MS [30]. Sometimes, the sesquiterpene derivatives (alcohols and ketones) described in J. glutinosa are erroneously included within the group of sesquiterpene lac-tones; however, they are not, since they do not have a lactonic ring in their structure. The presence in its composition of secondary metabolites with such varied chemical structures suggests that this species could be used for purposes other than the traditional ones [31]. Figure 4. Chemical structure of th s quiterpenes isolated from J. glutinosa (C. glutinosus) (9–16).The chemical composition of the essential oil of the leaves of J. glutinosa has also beeninvestigated by several authors. In 1996, Guillén and Ibargoitia conducted the first studyon the composition of essential oils and the pentane extract derived from the leaves, usingGC–MS and GC techniques. Their findings revealed that, while the leaves contain lowlevels of terpenic and sesquiterpenic hydrocarbons, they are abundant in their oxygenatedderivatives. The main components identified in the essential oil were camphor, endo-borneol, α-terpineol, ner lidol and τ-cadinol. The principal volatile compou ds recognizedin the pentane extract were α-pinen , camphor, ndo-borneol, γ-selinene, n rolid l, borneolformate, nonacosane and hentriacontane. The authors point out that the method usedfor plant extraction influences the nature of the components obtained and their relativeproportions [29].Plants 2025, 14, 205 12 of 42In our laboratory, we also studied the essential oil of the fresh leaves of J. glutinosa.In this case, extraction was performed by distillation in a modified Clevenger apparatuswith a water-cooled oil receiver to reduce artifact formation.

The presence in its compositionof secondary metabolites with such varied chemical structures suggests that this speciescould be used for purposes other than the traditional ones [31].4.1.3. Biological and Pharmacological ActivitiesDifferent studies have been carried out to justify the traditional uses of this species;however, despite the wide range of pharmacological activities attributed to it, there isa notable absence of scientific evidence regarding the effects of the plant on differentbiological functions and there is little conclusive data relating these actions to a particularactive principle or groups of active principles. The biological and pharmacological activitiesreported for both crude extracts and different isolated compounds are described below.Crude ExtractsValero et al. evaluated the therapeutic usefulness of the ethanolic extract of J. glutinosain an experimental model of ulcerative colitis induced by 2.5% DSS (sodium sulphate anddextran) in comparison with sulfasalazine as the reference drug and identified the chemicalcomponents with anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effects. The extract was able toscavenge superoxide radicals, inhibit 5-LOX (5-lipooxygenase) and reduce nitric oxide(NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. A reduction in myeloperoxidase activity,interleukin-6 (IL-6) and iNOS levels, as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression werealso observed. The results suggest that the phenolic compounds present in the ethanolicextract contribute to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of J. glutinosa [32].Natural antioxidant compounds play important roles in human health by exertingprotective effects against oxidative stress, aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In orderto study the phenolic profile and antioxidant activity of aqueous and methanolic extractsof J. glutinosa, these extracts were analysed before and after in vitro digestion to simulatehuman digestive conditions and to evaluate how this process affects the bioavailabilityof phenolic compounds. The identification and quantification of phenolic compoundspresent in the extracts was performed by HPLC–MS (HPLC–Mass Spectrometry). Themost abundant components were the dicaffeoylquinic acids, representing more than 90%of the total phenol content. Antioxidant activity was determined by spectrophotometricmethods. The authors found statistically significant differences in all parameters except forthe total phenolic content of both extracts. After in vitro digestion, the number of phenoliccompounds, as well as the antioxidant activity, were lower in the case of the aqueousextract. Although digestion reduced the number of phenols and the antioxidant action, theauthors suggest that the plant has great potential for its antioxidant properties and due toits content of bioactive phenolic compounds [33].Plants 2025, 14, 205 13 of 42The antioxidant effect and neuroprotective activity of an ethanolic extract of J. gluti-nosa was studied in vitro, evaluating the ability to inhibit certain enzymes involved inthe metabolism and function of acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline and nora-drenaline. These enzymes were monoamine oxidase A, tyrosinase and acetylcholinesterase.On the other hand, neuroprotective activity was evaluated in vivo, in the modified nema-tode Caenorhabditis elegans, as a model of Alzheimer’s disease, in which stress resistance,life expectancy and amyloid toxicity were studied. The extract reduced juglone-inducedoxidative stress in nematodes, increased life expectancy and prevented worm paralysis. Theparalysis in this nematode model simulates the neurodegeneration and neuronal dysfunc-tion that occurs in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease due to the accumulationof amyloid plaques. Several assays related reactive oxygen species with the developmentof this disorder, since they are known to foster the production and deposition of amyloidpeptides, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. In addition, oxidative stress islinked to ageing, so the extracts of J. glutinosa, as well as some of its bioactive components,could potentially be useful in the prevention of diseases associated with cellular aging andoxidative stress [34].In 2022, Mohammed et al. conducted a study on the chemical composition, antiox-idant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of the aqueous extract of J. glutinosa, har-vested in Libya. The total content of phenolic compounds in a hydroalcoholic extract(CH3OH/H2O 70/30) was determined by LC–MS (Liquid Chromatography coupled withMS). Methoxylated flavonoids and caffeoylquinic acids were identified. Antioxidant activitywas evaluated by two complementary methods: the ABTS assay, which uses 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, following the protocol described by Arnao(2001), and the ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) assay, based on oxygenradical scavenging capacity and FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) assay [35,36].Antiproliferative activity was evaluated in breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), hepatocellularcarcinoma (HepG2) and pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cell lines. Antibacterial activity wasevaluated using a modified Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test procedure [37].The authors found differences in phenolic content between the Libyan and Spanish species,which could be attributed to the effects of environmental conditions and soil composition,but also to variations in phenolic compound determination protocols. The extract showedsignificant antioxidant activity in all three methods used. On the other hand, although theextract showed some level of cell growth inhibition in tumor cell lines, the cytotoxic activitywas considered weak compared to doxorubicin and no antimicrobial activity was detected,so the results do not support its use as an antimicrobial agent [38].The potential of J. glutinosa as a dietary additive for aquatic animals has been inves-tigated for its biological and antioxidant activities. These assays were carried out withaqueous and ethanolic extracts and evaluated the effects of diets with different concentra-tions of this plant on sea bream (Sparus aurata L.), observing significant improvements inseveral immunological and antioxidant parameters, as well as in gene expression related toinflammation and oxidative stress. The authors suggest that the inclusion of this plant infish feed could enhance health and resistance to stress [39].Although this species is widely used in some regions of the Iberian Peninsula to treatgastrointestinal issues, scientific evidence regarding its effects on the digestive systemis limited. In a study designed to assess the antispasmodic properties of the traditionalinfusion of J. glutinosa, researchers investigated the spontaneous contractions of the ratduodenum in vitro using the plant’s aqueous extract, while also evaluating its in vivo effecton gastrointestinal transit in mice. The results showed that the rock tea extract reducedspontaneous contractions of the duodenal smooth muscle. This inhibitory effect was similarto that observed after the addition of verapamil, an L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist. On thePlants 2025, 14, 205 14 of 42other hand, the extract did not modify gastrointestinal transit in healthy mice. However, in amodel of colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium (a substance that causes inflammationof the colon), rock tea extract reversed the increased gastrointestinal transit associated withthis condition. The authors conclude that duodenal smooth muscle was relaxed throughL-type Ca2+ channels by rock tea extract, normalising peristalsis in a colitis sample. Theseresults could support the traditional use of J. glutinosa as an antispasmodic in patients withgastrointestinal disorders [40].In traditional medicine, rock tea is also known for its antihypertensive effect and car-diovascular protective properties; nevertheless, the underlying way it causes a hypotensiveaction is unknown. Valero et al. studied the vasorelaxant effects of J. glutinosa in rat aortaand found that the ethanolic extract produced a relaxation of aortic smooth muscle, whichcould be explained mechanistically by its inhibitory action on L-type Ca2+ channels. Theinhibitory effect was similar to that produced by verapamil. Moreover, the extract alsoblocked the contraction produced by α1-adrenergic receptor activation caused by phenyle-phrine. The authors note that a limitation of the study is that it is currently unknownwhether consumption of rock tea provides effective plasma concentrations of the activeconstituents to produce an observable antihypertensive effect [41].Protozoan diseases continue to represent a serious public health problem in emergingcountries, and their impact on global health may have been underestimated. Despitebeing old diseases, they continue to affect a substantial percentage of people in the world,particularly in less developed countries. The potential of natural products from higherplants used in traditional medicine has been widely explored [42]. The Asteraceae family,with a diverse range of chemical compounds, has shown remarkable potential for thedevelopment of new antiprotozoal therapies [43,44].Bioactive compounds derived from Asteraceae plants, such as flavonoids, terpenes andother secondary metabolites, could be a candidate source for combating this type of disease.In the specific case of J. glutinosa, there are few studies in which its antiprotozoal activity hasbeen studied, and all of them are in vitro studies. In a preliminary screening, the acetoneextract of the aerial part of this species showed antiprotozoal activity against Entamoebahistolytica and Leishmania donovani. Leishmanicidal activity was evaluated on Leishmaniadonovani (promastigote forms) in liquid medium (RPMI 1640) and the amoebicidal activitywas measured on Entamoeba histolytica (Rahman strain) in Jones liquid medium [45].In a study aimed at evaluating properties of J. glutinosa extract on metabolic disordersincluding enzymatic inhibition bioassays of lipase, α-glucosidase and fatty acid amidehydrolase were performed in cell-free systems. The assay showed the inhibition of lipase,α-glucosidase and fatty acid amide hydrolase [46].Isolated CompoundsSesquiterpene compounds of the eudesmanolide family are widely distributed metabo-lites in the plant kingdom and have attracted the attention of numerous researchers fortheir diverse range of biological activities, including its antifeedant property. This activ-ity is a defensive strategy that many plants and some animals use to protect themselvesfrom predators. They also have cell growth inhibitory activity, as well as plant growthregulatory activity.Given the antiprotozoal activity shown in previous studies by the acetone extractof J. glutinosa, and with the aim of investigating the active compounds of the plant, theeffect of the sesquiterpene alcohols 5-epi-kutdtriol and kutdtriol on Plasmodium falciparumand Leismania donovani was evaluated. (promastigote forms) The results showed that onlykutdtriol (12) was active against both parasites at a concentration of 250 µg/mL [47].Plants 2025, 14, 205 15 of 42Among the pharmacological actions described for sesquiterpenes is their anti-inflammatory activity. COX and LOX are key enzymes in inflammation and are there-fore pharmacological targets in the search for new therapeutic compounds, since they areresponsible for the production of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes. TheJ. glutinosa sesquiterpenes, lucinone (13), glutinone (14), 5-epi-kutdtriol (11) and kutdtriol(12), were studied in vitro for their anti-inflammatory properties in cellular systems thatgenerate metabolites from 5-LOX and COX. None of the compounds showed an inhibitionon leukotriene C4 (LTC4) production in mouse peritoneal cells stimulated with calciumionophore (A23187); however, all compounds inhibited prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release inmouse peritoneal cells, although with lower potency than indomethacin. Glutinone exertedan inhibitory effect on the COX pathway, whereas lucinone, kutdtriol and 5-epi-kutdtriolonly showed significant effect on PG-synthase activity. Only glutinone showed a significantreduction in calcium ionophore-induced thromboxane B2 (TXB2) release, but to a lesserextent than a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The conclusions are that, although theisolated sesquiterpenes possess anti-inflammatory activity, their effectiveness is inferior tothat of the reference drugs. The authors identify some structural features as responsible forthe inhibitory activity shown on arachidonic acid metabolism. Kutdtriol and 5-epi-kutdtrioldiffer in terms of stereochemistry (Figure 4). Alteration of the cis to trans substitution atposition 5 is a positive requirement for PG-synthase inhibition. All compounds have amethyl group at position 10, which could be an important functional group for PG synthaseactivity. On the other hand, the presence of an aliphatic chain at C-10 of glutinone couldbe a necessary requirement for TX-synthase activity since, when it is blocked, the effectdisappears. The results suggest that selective inhibition of the PG-synthase pathway is themain target of action of the sesquiterpenes studied, although glutinone produces moderateinhibition of TX-synthase. However, since TXB2 synthesis from arachidonic acid dependson both COX and TX-synthase activity, the release-dependent suppression of TXB2 releasecan also be explained by COX inhibition due to glutinone [48].Las Heras Etayo et al. (2021) conducted a literature review, based on clinical trials, inorder to relate the biological activity attributable to the plant with the presence of somechemical compounds previously identified in C. glutinosus, namely glutinone, lucinone,borneol, kutdtriol, camphor, kaempferol and quercetin. The authors also conducted anin silico modelling study to anticipate the possible effects of the active compounds ofC. glutinosus. These experiments enabled us to link certain therapeutic targets reported forthis species to the presence of its major components. However, further research is requiredto validate the findings [31].4.2. Chiliadenus montanusC. montanus (Vahl.) Brullo [J. montana (Vahl) Botsch., Chrysocoma montana (Vahl.) Symb.,Inula conyzoides DC., Linosyris montana DC., Varthemia montana (Vahl.) Boiss, Varthemiaconyzoides Boiss] [6], known as Heneida [49], is a medicinal plant native to the SinaiPeninsula [50]. It grows in alkaline soils in the desert east of the Nile, on the Sinai Peninsulain Egypt, the El-Tih desert east of the Suez Canal, in Arabia, on the Mediterranean coastand in Palestine (Figure 1B) [49,50]. The Sinai Peninsula is an epicentre of medicinal plantsin the Arabian Desert, with active constituents that serve as a focal point for ecologists,taxonomists and phyto-chemists worldwide. It is home to indigenous medicinal plants usedfor centuries to treat various diseases, and C. montanus is one of the most prominent [50,51].This plant is considered a vulnerable species due to its restricted habitat, intensive medicinaluse and commercial exploitation [52].A small, yellowish-green shrub with glandular and pubescent features, growing upto 60 cm tall, the stems are highly branched, and the leaves are sessile, oblanceolate orPlants 2025, 14, 205 16 of 42oblong-elliptic, covered with glandular hairs on both surfaces, with wavy edges and anacute or obtuse tip. The plant produces numerous solitary capitula arranged in a loosepanicle. The peduncles are bracteate, and the involucre is campanulate, with phyllaries in3–4 layers that are loosely overlapping, glandular-hairy, and yellow, with the outer onespartially greenish at the rounded apex. The inner phyllaries are scarious and longer. Theachenes are densely hairy, and the pappus is reddish–brown (Figure 2B) [50].4.2.1. Traditional UsesC. montanus is broadly employed in historical Egyptian medicine, highly appreciatedamong traditional healers and Bedouins. For centuries it has been recognized as an impor-tant medicinal plant, whose knowledge and uses have been passed down from generationto generation from the ancient Egyptians to the present day. It is used in infusions for thetreatment of various diseases, including “kidney symptoms, chest disorders, diarrhoea andstomach pain” [49,51,53,54].4.2.2. PhytochemistryNumerous papers have been published on the existence, in C. montanus, of componentsof different natures, including volatile oils, flavonoids, monoterpenes, diterpenes, triter-penes, sesquiterpenes and sterols. In relation to flavonoids, different aglycones have beenidentified in the aerial part of J. montana, such as quercetin and 6-hydroxykaempferol methylethers, as well as quercecetagetin 3,5,6,7,3′-pentamethyl ether (17) [55]. In the chloroplastextract of the aerial part, the presence of 3, 6, 7, 3′, 4′-pentamethoxy quercetin (artemetin)(19), 3, 6, 7, 3′-tetramethoxy quercetin (chrysosplenetin) (20), 3, 6, 3′, 4′-tetramethoxyquercetin (21), and 3, 6, 7-trimethoxy quercetin (22) has been described, along with 3, 6,3′-trimethoxy quercetin (jaceidin) (23), 3, 6, 4′-trimethoxy quercetin (centaureidin) (24), 3, 3′,4′-trimethoxy quercetin (25), 3, 6-dimethoxy quercetin (26), 3, 3′-dimethoxy quercetin (27), 7,4′-dimethoxy quercetin (28) and quercetin (18). The same authors identified three flavonoidglycosides in the ethyl acetate fraction, quercetin-3-O-β-D-galacturonopyranoside (29),quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3) and patuletin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), as wellas two phenolic acids in the n-buthanol fraction, 3,5-dicaffeoyl-quinic acid (31) and caffeicacid (32), and two flavonoid glycosides, quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (quercitrin)(30) and quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (7) (Table 3) (Figure 5) [54].

Subsequently, other authors also identified some of these methoxylated flavonoids in a methanolic extract [63].  Figure 5.

Biological and Pharmacological Activities Biological and pharmacological activity studies conducted so far have shown that C. montanus has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiatherogenic and antidiabetic activity, as well as potential to reduce fat accumulation and body weight, suggesting a beneficial role in the treatment of obesity. In addition, there are studies that Figure 6. Chemical structure of the terpenes isolated from J. ontana (C. montanus) (33–49).I a phytochemical analys s of the CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1) extract obtained from theleaves, jasomontanone (41), an eudesmanolide-type sesquiterpene with a new 5/7-membered bicyclic ring system, was isolated and identified. The compound wasidentified as (3aR*, 6R*, 8aR)-3a-(hydroxymethyl)-6-(2-hydroxy-propan-2-yl)-8α-methyl-Plants 2025, 14, 205 20 of 42octahydrazulen-4(5H)-one [58]. From the leaves, jasonone (4-hydroxy-5,10-dimethyl-octahydro-azulen-8-one) was also obtained by extraction with CH2Cl2 (42) [54]. Montanone(43), an isoiphionane sesquiterpene, was isolated from the aerial part [60].From the aerial part of C. montanus, Elhady et al. also isolated four sesquiterpenes:intermedeol (44), 5α-hydroperoxy-β-eudesmol (45), eudesm-11,13-ene-1β,4β,7α-triol (36)and 1β,4β,7β,11-tetrahydroxyeudesmane (46) [61].Among the diterpenes present in the aerial part, jasonin-a has been isolated (1E)-2-[(2S)-1,2,5-trimethylbicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl]vinyl bencene-3-carboxylic acid (47), jasonin-b ([3-((2 S, 5 S)-1,2, 5-trimethylcycloheptanyl)propyl]bencene-3-carboxylic acid) (48) amdasonin-c([(1 E)-3-((7 R -1,7-dimethyl-4-methylencycloheptanyl)prop-1-enyl]bencene-3-carboxylicacid) (49) (Table 3) (Figure 6) [56].The components of the essential oil were also studied by gas chromatography–massspectrometry (GC–MS). Fifty-eight components were characterized, of which the main oneswere borneol, camphor, chrysanthemol, bornyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, and intermedeol [65].4.2.3. Biological and Pharmacological ActivitiesBiological and pharmacological activity studies conducted so far have shown thatC. montanus has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiatherogenicand antidiabetic activity, as well as potential to reduce fat accumulation and body weight,suggesting a beneficial role in the treatment of obesity. In addition, there are studies thatattribute anticholinesterase activity, which would suggest its potential use in therapy forAlzheimer disease [66]. The biological and pharmacological activities reported for bothcrude extracts and different isolated compounds are described below.Crude ExtractsNumerous studies have shown that C. montanus extracts possess significant andpromising antioxidant activity, mainly attributed to its polyphenols. The ethanolic extractof the aerial part revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenolic compounds that, as is wellknown, are able to modulate many enzymes and numerous cellular systems. In addition,they have important anti-hepatotoxic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoporoticand even antitumor and antioxidant effects [67].In 2008, Hussein suggested that some components of this plant scavenged free radicals,producing antioxidant activity, and protected tissues from lipid peroxidation [68]. C.montanus contains high levels of polyphenols, mainly flavonoids, which are excellentantioxidants and iron chelating agents. Flavonoids scavenge reactive oxygen species andfree radicals by several mechanisms. In addition, the ability shown by the extract to chelateiron contributes to the preventing of oxidative reactions. In 2010, the same author claimedthat the ethanolic extract of the aerial part of this species was able to reduce the harmfuleffects of iron accumulation in an in vivo model of iron overload. The extract produced astatistically significant decrease in liver and kidney iron levels, serum iron, serum ferritinand serum transferrin [69].On the other hand, the high content of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds inthe ethanolic extract seems to be responsible for the anticholestatic activity detected in arat model of ethinylestradiol-induced biliary cholestasis. In addition, and in agreementwith the previous findings, a significant hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity wasobserved. The authors of this study highlight the therapeutic potential of this plant indrug-induced biliary cholestasis [70]. Likewise, in an obese rat model, the anti-obesity, anti-atherogenic, anti-diabetic and antioxidant activity of the ethanolic extract was studied. Thisextract helped maintain levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx),glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), all importantPlants 2025, 14, 205 21 of 42antioxidant factors in the liver, which would normally be reduced due to oxidative stresscaused by obesity and a high-fat diet. Anti-obesity action is attributed to an increase in liverenergy expenditure, a reduction in fatty acid synthesis and an increase in the utilisation offat as energy [71].Eissa et al. (2013) investigated the antioxidant and cytoprotective properties of hy-droalcoholic extracts of C. montanus under H2O2-induced oxidative stress conditions in ahuman astrocytoma cell line. Research on the antioxidant capacity was conducted using theORAC method, comparing with a vitamin E analogue. The results showed the potent freeradical scavenging activity of the extract. Such activity could protect against the damagingaction of oxidative species and, consequently, against lipid peroxidation in cell membranes,events that are involved in the pathophysiological development of many diseases relatedto oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds seem to be mainly responsible for this antioxidantactivity, which is closely related to the hydroxyl groups attached to the benzene ring inthe flavone structure [72]. Other authors attribute the antioxidant effect not only to theflavonoids, but also to the high content of terpenic compounds, mainly sesquiterpenes [73].The effect of methanolic extract of C. montanus leaves against CCl4-induced hepato-toxicity in rats was analysed by measuring several hepatic biochemical parameters. Theextract reduced hepatotoxicity by scavenging free radicals and significant improvementswere observed in all parameters studied, suggesting a hepatoprotective and antioxidantaction [74].In an attempt to explain the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the effect ofaqueous and ethanolic extracts of the aerial part of J. montana on protein biosynthesisin rat hepatocytes, Hussein et al. (2020) conducted in vivo research on the effects of theadministration of these extracts on hepatic and renal tissues. In the liver of treated rats, theextracts promoted an increase in protein, RNA and DNA content. These authors suggestthat certain components of the extracts, particularly flavonoids, could promote hepaticsynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins by reducing the activity of plasma transaminases andalkaline phosphatase, which could indicate a protective effect on hepatic cells, maintainingthe integrity of hepatic and lysosomal cell membranes [75]. As previously mentioned,these extracts have potent antioxidant effects, acting as free radical scavengers and in-hibitors of LDL oxidation, and the relationship between this antioxidant action and thehepatoprotective activity shown by flavonoids has been demonstrated. The antidiabetic,hypolipidemic and antioxidant effect of aqueous extract of J. montana was studied in ratswith alloxan-induced diabetes. Diabetic rats treated with the extract showed a decrease inblood glucose levels, an improvement in lipid profile and a reduction in insulin and totalprotein levels. On the other hand, treatment with aqueous extract of J. montana in diabeticrats was beneficial to the morphological changes produced in liver, kidney and pancreasin diabetic rats, so the authors suggest that this species exerts a powerful protective andtissue regenerative effect, which could be related to its antioxidant activity [76].Administration of C. montanus extract to rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetesshowed a reduction in blood glucose levels. The authors attribute this to increased glucoseuptake in skeletal muscle and adipocytes, as well as increased insulin secretion in pancreaticcells. Histopathological analysis showed an increase in the number, size and volume ofislets of Langerhans, as well as an increased cell density within the islets [77]. These findingsare consistent with a previous study that claimed that C. montanus had antihyperglycemicproperties in alloxan-induced diabetic rats [62]. C. montanus extract could exhibit anantidiabetic action through several mechanisms, including inhibition of α-amylase, anenzyme that hydrolyses the α-linkages of starch to produce glucose and maltose [77–79].Plants 2025, 14, 205 22 of 42J. montana is also attributed to have anti-inflammatory properties. As early as 2007, itwas suggested that sterols and triterpenes were the causative agents of these properties byinhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines [59].In relation to antimicrobial activity, the essential oil showed antibacterial activityagainst Bacillus subtilis. Marked antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes,Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans was also found [65]. Al-Howiriny et al. demon-strated that petroleum ether and chloroform extracts of the aerial part of J. montana showedactivity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Candidaalbicans, while the chloroform extract showed activity only against Bacillus subtilis andStaphylococcus aureus [56].The essential oil of the aerial part of C. montanus extracted by hydro-distillation wasevaluated for its potential action against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in human astro-cytoma U373-MG cells. The chemical composition of the essential oil was analysed usingGC–MS, identifying that the main compounds were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes,both oxygenated. In vitro evaluation of the antioxidant properties of the essential oil usingthe ORAC assay revealed a low protective activity against oxidative stress [80].The hydroalcoholic extract of C. montanus showed positive results against poliomyelitisvirus (POLIO) with high antiviral activity, confirming the properties attributed in Egyptianfolk medicine. The authors relate the antiviral activity to its content in methoxylatedflavones, since some 3-methoxyflavones previously isolated, as well as their syntheticderivatives, showed interesting antiviral activity against picornavirus, including POLIOvirus [81,82].Recently, the cytotoxic effects of methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of J. montanahave been evaluated in colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and Caco-2), showing a reduc-tion in cell growth rate, as well as a reduction in the expression of some cell differentiationmarkers in the case of the two extracts, results that can be attributed to both sesquiterpenesand methoxylated flavonoids [83].Other biological or pharmacological activities have also been described for extractsof J. montana. One is the anticholinesterase activity, attributable to the high content ofsesquiterpenes and flavonoids in the ethanolic extract. This extract has been shown to havea neurotrophic and anti-amyloidogenic effect, which has led to its possible used in thepharmacological therapy for Alzheimer disease [84].In addition, antiplatelet aggregation and hypotensive activity has been described forthe aqueous extract of J. montana [85].Isolated CompoundsFlavonoids are well known for their antioxidant properties. This activity is markedlyinfluenced by the number and position of the hydroxyl groups in the flavone structure, aswell as by the degree of conjugation of their rings. The numerous hydroxyl groups in theirstructure, the presence of methoxyl groups, which increase lipophilicity, and the existenceof a double bond and a carbonyl function in the central ring, which increase reactivity byfavouring electron conjugation and delocalisation, are essential to their antioxidant action(Figure 5) [53,86]. In the specific case of quercetin (18), the most common flavone aglyconein J. montana, the main mechanism of its antioxidant action seems to be the donation ofhydrogen atoms [87].Among the multiple pharmacological activities exhibited by flavonoids, their activityagainst several types of cancer through the modulation of apoptosis stands out [88]. Jaceidin(5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3,6,3′-trimethoxyflavone) (23), a methoxylated flavone, showed powerfulin vitro cytotoxic activity against liver cancer (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines.However, the compound 5,7-dihydroxy-3,3′,4′-trimethoxyflavone (25), despite its structuralPlants 2025, 14, 205 23 of 42similarity to jaceidin, showed less inhibition of these cell lines, which could be explainedby the different configuration and arrangement of the flavonoid B-ring functional groups(Figure 5), since this configuration is decisive for the elimination of free radicals and theinhibition of lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, in order to determine its antitumoreffect in vivo, a mouse model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) was used to evaluate theplasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as several targets of freeradicals which could explain its antitumor effect. The results revealed a reduction in tumorweight and an improvement in the histological picture of the tumor, as well as a decrease inoxidative stress. The authors of this work suggest that jaceidin acts as a selective inhibitorof VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. The interaction of jaceidin with target receptors was alsostudied by molecular docking techniques [61].The poly-methoxylated and polyhydroxylated flavonoids, 5,7-dihydroxy-3,3′,4′-trimethoxyflavone (25) and chrysosplenetin (20), present in C. montanus, have shownchemoprotective and anticarcinogenic effects, respectively [53,54]. Chrysosplenetin (20),centaureidin (24) and quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), isolated from the aqueousextract of the aerial part of J. montana, showed a promising cytotoxic effect against theHeLA cervical carcinoma cell line [54].Moreover, the methoxylated flavone 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxyflavone (27) wasshown to negatively regulate LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression, includingTNFα, IL-1β, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), COX1, COX2 and 5-LOX [63].The effect of the methoxylated flavones 5,7-dihydroxy-3,3′,4′-trimethoxyflavone (25),bonanzin (21) and artemetin (19), obtained from CH2Cl2:CH3OH (1:1) extract on theinduction of the chemo-preventive enzyme NQO1 [(NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase1]. NQO1’s activity is an indicator of the antioxidant capacity of cells, which is measuredto understand the toxicity of certain compounds and their potential to induce protectiveresponses in cells. Only the former showed a pronounced dose-dependent induction ofNQO1. The other two compounds showed no activity in the concentration range tested,suggesting the importance of substitutions on the A-ring of flavonoids for enzyme-inducingactivity (Figure 5) [53].The other group of compounds of C. montanus with interesting biological activitiesis terpenes. Isolated sesquiterpenes have shown certain cytotoxicity against human coloncarcinoma (Caco-2) and human cervical cancer cells [54,64]. The 3-oxo-γ-costic acid, agly-cone de 3-oxo-γ-costic acid β-D-glucopyranoside ester (33), has antiproliferative activityagainst human colon and lung cancer cell lines (Caco-1 and A549, respectively). In addition,four sesquiterpenes were obtained from it by fungal transformation using Athelia rolfsii,one of which also exhibited antiproliferative activity against the A549 cell line. This is anexample of how fungal-mediated chemical transformations can lead to new and potentactive agents, in some cases with improved characteristics relative to their precursors [64].The potential use of C. montanus in different industrial areas, as well as in the miti-gation of environmental pollution, has been reported. The extensive use of cellulosic andlignocellulosic materials has generated a significant accumulation of waste, contributingto environmental pollution. A Gram-positive endophytic bacterium identified as Lysini-bacillus xylanilyticus was isolated from C. montanus, which is capable of breaking downcellulose [89].The study of the allelopathic characteristics of C. montanus revealed that ethyl acetateand butanol extracts obtained from the aerial part show significant inhibitory activityagainst several weed species, including Convolvulus arvensis and Calystegia inflata, as wellas other species such as Portulaca oleracea and Arabidopsis thaliana. This may suggest apotential use as a natural herbicide for weed control. The compounds with phytotoxicactivity belong to the group of flavonoids and sesquiterpenes and among the most activePlants 2025, 14, 205 24 of 42were methoxylated flavones. The authors suggest that allelochemicals from J. montanacould be used both as natural herbicides and as therapeutic agents for diseases caused bymicroorganisms [90].4.3. Chiliadenus iphionoidesC. iphionoides (Boiss. and Blanche) Brullo [Blanchea iphionioides (Boiss. and C.I.Blanche) Boiss., Iphiona iphionoides (Boiss. and C.I. Blanche) Benth. and Hook.f. ex B.D.Jacks., Jasonia iphionoides (Boiss. and C.I. Blanche) Botsch., Varthemia iphionoides Boiss.and C.I. Blanche] [6,50] is a medicinal species endemic to the eastern Mediterranean [91]. Itgrows in rocky places and extreme deserts in most regions of Israel, from Mount Hermonto the southern Negev, as well as in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Sinai Peninsula(Figure 1C) [6].It is a small perennial shrub, distinguished by its aroma, 20–50 cm high, with awoody base, hairy and sticky aromatic stems, small leaves covered with hairs and glandscontaining essential oil, which gives the plant its unique aroma. Its flowers are tubular andyellow (Figure 2C). It flowers from September to December [92].As discussed in Section 2 of this article, C. iphionoides was previously classified underthe name V. iphionoides. Since many relevant studies were published using this earliernomenclature, it has been decided to incorporate these papers to provide a complete andaccurate overview of the research carried out on this species. In these cases, we will refer toit as V. iphionoides.4.3.1. Traditional UsesC. iphionoides has been commonly employed as herbal medicine in pain mitigation,wounds, eye infections, and in cases of urinary retention [92]. It has also been used forgastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, male and female fertility disorders, kidney stones,fever, influenza, depression, stomach pain, nervousness and as an anti-inflammatory [93].Fresh leaves are used externally, or fresh or dried leaves are administered orally as aninfusion, based on the indication.It is also attributed to have anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antispas-modic and antiplatelet action, among others. In addition to its medicinal uses, C. iphionoideshas been used as a deodorant, cooking spice, condiment and as a sugar-sweetened herbaltea [94].4.3.2. PhytochemistryDifferent flavonoids were separated and identified from the aerial part of V. iphionoides,including xanthomicrol (50), kumatakenin (51), jaceidin (23) and 3,3′-dimethoxy quercetin(27) (Table 4) (Figure 7) [95].Subsequently, also from the aerial part, seven other methoxy-flavones were iso-lated and identified: 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyflavone (52), 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxyflavone (27), 3,5,6,7,8,4′-hexamethoxytflavone (53), 5,4′-dihydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (54), 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone (55), 5,4′-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (56) and 5,4′-dihydroxy-3,7,3′-trimethoxyflavone (57) (Table 4)(Figure 7) [96].Plants 2025, 14, 205 25 of 42Plants 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 of 43    Figure 7. Chemical structure of the compounds isolated from V. iphionoides (C. iphionoides) (50–58). The study of the chemical composition of the essential oil of V. iphionoides by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) resulted in the identification of caryo-phyllene, eudesmol and spatulenol as main components, known for their aromatic and therapeutic properties, among which are anti-inflammatory and central nervous system relaxing effects [99]. The results of a study describing the content and composition of the essential oil of C. iphionoides in plants from the Jordan Valley (Jordan) showed the presence of borneol, as the main constituent, as well as 1,8-cineole, α-terpineol, camphor, bornyl formate, ter-pinen-4-ol and bornyl acetate. Phytochemical analysis of C. iphionoides collected in Israel showed a different composition of the essential oil, as these populations were found to be rich in intermedeol, a product not found in Jordanian plants. Chrysanthemic acid and τ-cadinol were also found. In addition, a large variation in essential oil composition was found among the different Israeli populations [100]. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the differences in essential oil composition among the different wild populations of C. iphionoides, a study of the endemic species from all over Israel was conducted. The essen-tial oil was obtained by hydro-distillation of the aerial parts of the plants and analysed by GC–MS. Considerable variation was observed in the composition of the essential oils of the different populations, with a significant correlation between chemical composition and geographic location. Three main chemotypes were identified: a camphor/α-pi-nene/phochienol chemotype, a τ-cadinol/1,8-cineole/trans-chrysanthemol chemotype, and an intermedeol chemotype [101]. 4.3.3. Biological and Pharmacological Activities Crude Extracts There are numerous studies describing the biological activity of C. iphionoides ex-tracts. In one of the first published works on this species, the aqueous extract showed limited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi-murium and Bacillus cereus [95]. In a later publication, the ethyl acetate extract of the aerial part of V. iphionoides showed in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides. In contrast, hexane and ethanol extracts were not active. i . i l t t f t i l t f . i hio oides ( . iphionoides) (50–58).Table 4.

Phytochemical analysis of C. iphionoides collected in Israel showedPlants 2025, 14, 205 26 of 42a different composition of the essential oil, as these populations were found to be rich inintermedeol, a product not found in Jordanian plants. Chrysanthemic acid and τ-cadinolwere also found. In addition, a large variation in essential oil composition was found amongthe different Israeli populations [100]. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the differences inessential oil composition among the different wild populations of C. iphionoides, a study ofthe endemic species from all over Israel was conducted. The essential oil was obtained byhydro-distillation of the aerial parts of the plants and analysed by GC–MS. Considerablevariation was observed in the composition of the essential oils of the different populations,with a significant correlation between chemical composition and geographic location.Three main chemotypes were identified: a camphor/α-pinene/phochienol chemotype, a τ-cadinol/1,8-cineole/trans-chrysanthemol chemotype, and an intermedeol chemotype [101].4.3.3. Biological and Pharmacological ActivitiesCrude ExtractsThere are numerous studies describing the biological activity of C. iphionoides extracts.In one of the first published works on this species, the aqueous extract showed limitedantibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimuriumand Bacillus cereus [95]. In a later publication, the ethyl acetate extract of the aerial part ofV. iphionoides showed in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillussubtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides. Incontrast, hexane and ethanol extracts were not active.Masadeh et al. (2013) evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic extractof V. iphionoides, among other Jordanian medicinal plants, against four types of bacteria:Enterobacter faecalis, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antimicrobialsusceptibility tests were carried out and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)was determined. The ethanolic extract of V. iphionoides was the most active against E.faecalis [102].Al-Dabbas et al. conducted research on the antioxidant and α-amylase inhibitorycompounds present in the aerial parts of V. iphionoides. They isolated several bioactivecompounds and evaluated their antioxidant capacity by free radical scavenging assays,such as DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), as well as their ability to inhibit the enzymeα-amylase, which is relevant to the control of blood glucose levels. The results showedthe presence of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds in the extracts of V. iphionoides,with significant antioxidant activity and remarkable ability to inhibit α-amylase. Thesefindings suggest that V. iphionoides may be a valuable source of natural compounds usefulin the prevention of oxidative stress and in the management of diabetes, highlighting itstherapeutic potential and its relevance in the development of plant-based treatments [96].Other authors also investigated the antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic propertiesof C. iphinoides in order to support its traditional use. Extracts of different polarity (methanol,acetone, hexane and water) were analysed. Antioxidant activity was determined by theDPPH method. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against six strains: Pseudomonasaeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shegilla sonnie, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus andmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antifungal activity against Candida albicansand Epidermatophyton floccosum was also determined. Antiproliferative and apoptoticactivity was assessed by colorimetric methods. All four extracts, aqueous, methanolic,acetonic and hexane, showed antioxidant activity. The acetonic extract showed the highestantimicrobial potency; next was the hexane and methanolic extracts, whereas the aqueousextract only showed antimicrobial activity against Shegilla sonnie. The acetone and hexaneextracts showed potent antiproliferative properties, as did the methanolic extract [103].Plants 2025, 14, 205 27 of 42The first study demonstrating the hypoglycemic effect of C. iphionoides in in vitromodels of diabetes and in rats with streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes was conducted in2011. In diabetic animals, the aqueous extract of the aerial part reduced blood glucose levelsby 70% after one hour. In healthy rats, the extract also reduced blood glucose four hoursafter treatment. Factors that modulate blood glucose levels, such as insulin production andglucose utilisation by muscle and adipose tissue, were investigated. In cellular models,C. iphionoides extract increased insulin secretion in pancreatic cells and glucose uptake inskeletal muscle and adipocytes. In rats, the extract reduced blood glucose levels in both oraltolerance tests and long-term feeding studies. Treatment with the extract also significantlydecreased total blood lipid levels and hepatic cholesterol. The data obtained showed thatthe antidiabetic effects of the plant could be linked not only to amylase inhibition, but alsoto an increase in insulin secretion and glucose utilisation [104,105].Kasabri et al. (2011) provided new data on the possible mechanisms involved in theantidiabetic effect shown by the aqueous extract of V. iphionoides. They evaluated in vivoand in vitro the plant’s postprandial antihyperglycemic activity on the enzymatic digestionof starch (using α-amylase and α-amyloglucosidase) as a possible mode of antidiabeticaction. In vitro, aqueous extract of V. iphionoides exerted significant dual dose-dependentinhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, thus the authors suggest that it could improveglucose homeostasis by significantly delaying carbohydrate absorption [106].A study was conducted to investigate the metabolic effects of C. iphionoides consump-tion in an animal model of obesity and non-alcoholic osteopathy induced by a high-fat diet.Dietary supplementation with a hydroalcoholic extract significantly reduced the weightgain induced by the obesogenic diet. Likewise, fat accumulated in the liver and adiposetissue were reduced for the animals which consumed C. iphionoides. Reduction of hepaticsteatosis was demonstrated histologically, and by plasma levels of liver enzymes and lipidprofile, which indicated a favourable evolution of liver function and lipid metabolism, aswell as increased insulin sensitivity [107].Numerous natural products obtained from plants are currently used as cytotoxicagents (colchicine, vinca alkaloids, paclitaxel, among others), so this field has always been asource of research. The first references to the cytotoxic activity of C. iphionoides date back to1999 [98]. Subsequently, Al-Dabbas et al. studied the in vitro cytotoxic activity of extractsof different polarity of V. iphionoides on human leukaemia cells (HL-60) and suggested itsanticancer potential [96].In 2013, Elbadry et al. investigated the in vitro cytotoxic effect of acetone, ethanol,ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, methanol and aqueous extracts of the aerial part ofC. iphionoides on HeLa cervical carcinoma and MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinomacell lines. Every extract studied exhibited cytotoxic effects against the HeLa cell line, withthe aqueous extract showing the least activity. On the other hand, acetone and methanolextracts showed a very strong cytotoxic activity against the MCF7 cell line, while ethylacetate and petroleum ether extracts showed a strong cytotoxic activity, but with a higherpercentage of cell viability, compared to the two previous examples [108].In the same year, Thoppil et al. evaluated the antitumor activity of extracts ofV. iphionoides, among other species, against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2cells. They investigated its effect on cell viability by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, observing induction of apoptosis and morphologicalchanges in neoplastic cells. V. iphionoides extract showed significant cytotoxic activity,reducing cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of apoptosis was also foundin cells treated with the extract, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and the formation ofapoptotic bodies [109].Plants 2025, 14, 205 28 of 42Isolated CompoundsFlavonoids 50, 51, 23 and 27, obtained from the aerial part of V. iphionoides [95], werestudied from the point of view of their antispasmodic activity on rabbit intestinal smoothmuscle. Compounds 50 and 23 showed dose-dependent activity [110]. In another study, theantimicrobial activity of flavonoids present in the aqueous extract was evaluated againstEscherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus. Compound51 was active against the fungi Fusarium solani and Candida tropicalis, while compounds 27and 50 showed higher activity against Aspergillus parasiticus, Candida tropicalis and Fusariumsolani [95].In subsequent research, the antiplatelet activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts,essential oil and pure flavonoids (50, 51, 23 and 27) isolated from the aerial part ofV. iphionoides was evaluated. The activity was determined by optical aggregometry usingcollagen and ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) as aggregation inducers. Compound 50 wasthe more potent in both cases, while compound 23 did not show significant antiaggregantactivity. Neither the alcoholic extract nor the essential oil showed anti-aggregation activitywith either of the two aggregation inducers. The aqueous extract showed a dose-dependentanti-aggregation activity against aggregation induced by both collagen and ADP. It is con-cluded that the aqueous extract of V. iphionoides thus contains compounds with significantantiplatelet aggregation activity [111].In 2006, the antioxidant activity of certain extracts of V. iphionoides was evaluated.Since, as previously mentioned, the antioxidative capacity of many plants is linked tothe phenolic compound content, the relationship between this activity and the phenoliccompound content of various extracts of this species was evaluated, and it was observedthat the content was highest in the ethanolic extract, followed by the aqueous extract, ethylacetate, chloroform and hexane (in decreasing order). The activity of the isolated productswas also studied. Flavonoids 52, 27 and 57 showed a pronounced free radical scavengingcapacity [96].In 2005, these same authors reported the potent antimicrobial activity of sesquiterpene58 against six different types of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus Escherichiacoli, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella enteritides and Bacillus cereus) [97].4.4. Chiliadenus lopadusanusC. lopadusanus Brullo [Jasonia lopadusana (Brullo) M. Pardo and R. Morales] is anherbaceous, perennial plant endemic to the island of Lampedusa, the hugest island of thePelagian archipelago in Italy, where it grows spontaneously in rocky and sunny places(Figure 1D) [6,112].It can reach a variable height depending on environmental conditions. Its leavesare alternate, linear or lanceolate, with glandular trichomes of different types on bothepidermises. Inflorescences are yellow flower heads typical of the Asteraceae family, whichare grouped in clusters. Each capitulum has ligulate flowers at the edge and tubular flowersin the middle (Figure 2D). It has a typical camphoraceous odour [113].4.4.1. Traditional UsesThere are not many published items of data on the traditional uses of C. lopadusanus,but based on its bioactive components, such as farnesane-type sesquiterpenes, its medicinalpotential in the treatment of bacterial skin infections and wounds can be inferred [112]. Inaddition, although not extensively documented, it is likely that, like other plants in the Aster-aceae family, C. lopadusanus has traditionally been used for its anti-inflammatory propertiesto relieve muscle and joint pain, as well as to treat digestive problems such as dyspepsiaPlants 2025, 14, 205 29 of 42and upset stomach. An exhaustive review of the ethnobotanical and pharmacologicalliterature would be necessary to find direct references to these properties.4.4.2. PhytochemistryThe first published study on the chemical composition of the essential oil of theaerial part of C. lopadusanus was that of Sacco and Maffei, which provided a preliminaryidentification of its constituents [113]. In 2013, the components isolate in the essentialoil extracted by hydro-distillation of the aerial part (leaves and flowers) of this specieswere analysed by GC–MS and compared with the results obtained previously. A totalof 98 components were identified in the essential oil from the leaves and 83 in the oilfrom the flowers. The most common compounds in both oils were monoterpenes andsesquiterpenes, both oxygenated. The principal constituent was camphor (in leaves andflowers), and the next in leaves was torreyol, τ-cadinol and 1,8-cineole, but in flowers itwas the sesquiterpenes τ-muurolol, torreyol and τ-cadinol [114]. Several of the identifiedcompounds could play an important role in the antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic andspasmolytic activity described for this species [115].Masi et al. (2021) conducted the purification and chemical characterisation of theprincipal metabolites present in the n-hexane extract of the aerial part of C. lopadusanus.The isolated compounds were identified using spectroscopic techniques and comparedwith data reported in the literature. These compounds were 9-hydroxynerolidol (59),9-oxonerolidol (60) (Figure 8) and chiliadenol B (38) (Figure 6).Plants 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 29 of 43    Figure 8. Chemical structure of non-cyclic sesquiterpenes isolated from C. lopadusanus (59–60). Masi’s work addressed the determination of the absolute configuration of these non-cyclic sesquiterpenes by vibrational circular dichroism and electronic circular dichroism These compounds present analytical challenges due to their flexible structure, which al-lows the molecules to adopt multiple conformations in solution, complicating their struc-tural analysis, and also due to the absence of rings [112]. The combination of the two cir-cular dichroism techniques allowed the determination of the absolute configuration of non-cyclic sesquiterpenes [116]. 4.4.3. Biological and Pharmacological Activities Masi et al. (2021) conducted research on the antimicrobial effect of C. lopadusanus ex-tract against the pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolated compounds, particularly the farnesane-type sesquiterpenes, were identified as responsi-ble for this activity. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determining the MIC. The crude extracts were able to inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate already preformed bio-films of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by crystal violet assays. On the other hand, the three isolated farnesane-type sesquiterpenes also showed significant antibacte-rial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and greater effectiveness in inhibiting and erad-icating Staphylococcus aureus biofilms compared crude extracts. However, neither the crude extracts nor the isolated compounds showed antibacterial activity against Acineto-bacter baumannii [112]. 4.5. Chiliadenus bocconei C. bocconei Brullo (Jasonia bocconei (Brullo) M. Pardo and R. Morales) [6] (The Global Compositae Checklist), commonly known as Maltese fleabane or tulliera salvagga, is a plant native to Malta (Figure 1E) and typically thrives in coastal garrigue environments, favour-ing dry, rocky areas (Figure 2E). Well-suited to arid conditions, it grows in narrow crev-ices on barren, rocky slopes of cliffs and valleys near the coast, where small amounts of calcareous soil can be found [117]. 4.5.1. Traditional Uses After reviewing the literature, no data on its traditional use have been found, alt-hough Buhagiar et al. (2015) refer to some data of this type in a publication by Lanfranco in 1992. C. bocconei was employed in Maltese traditional medicine for respiratory problems and inflammatory processes [118,119], although specific documentation is sparse and re-quires further review to confirm this data. 4.5.2. Phytochemistry The only published study on the chemical composition of C. bocconei refers to the essential oil obtained from the leaves (collected in winter and summer).

Well-suited to arid conditions, it grows in narrow crevices onbarren, rocky slopes of cliffs and valleys near the coast, where small amounts of calcareoussoil can be found [117].4.5.1.

Buhagiar et al.identified camphor, borneol and τ-cadinol in summer-collected plant and τ-cadinol, cam-phor, oplopenone, aloaromadendrene and cis-γ-cadinene, in winter-collected leaves. Thepresence of camphor was lower in winter foliage, which may explain the near absence ofodour in this period [119].There are no studies in the literature on the non-volatile components of this species.4.5.3. Biological and Pharmacological ActivitiesThere are no published articles on the biological and pharmacological activity of thisspecies, neither of the crude extracts nor of the isolated compounds. Only one work appearsin the literature as part of a doctoral thesis, whose general objectives were to study thephytochemical profile and antioxidant effects of four medicinal plants selected from Maltaon the basis of ethnopharmacological records. One of these species was C. bocconei. Thesediscoveries served as the foundation for bioassays aimed at uncovering the molecularmechanisms responsible for the extracts’ anti-inflammatory effects in human cell modelsof inflammation. The aerial part of C. bocconei was extracted with five different solventsand in each extract the total content of alkaloids, triterpenes and phenols was determinedby spectrophotometric assays. Antioxidant activity was studied using the free radicalscavenging method. The effect of the extracts on the release of proinflammatory cytokines,TNF-α and IL-1β, was also investigated. Furthermore, studies were conducted to evaluatethe impact of the extracts on NF-κB transcriptional activity within human cell modelsof inflammation. Ethanolic, aqueous, and acetonic extracts of C. bocconei were found tosignificantly inhibit the release of TNF-α and IL-1β induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)in phorbol ester-differentiated U937 cells. The acetone extract of C. bocconei showed anexcellent profile in terms of power and efficacy in inhibiting TNFα release. This representsthe first scientific investigation documenting the properties of C. bocconei extracts on theinhibition of the release of the IL-lβ and TNFα from human cell lines. Determination of thephytochemical, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of selected Maltese medicinalplants are from the doctoral dissertation, https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/31934, accessed on 10 September 2024).Plants 2025, 14, 205 31 of 424.6. Chiliadenus antiatlanticusC. antiatlanticus (Emb and Maire) Gómiz [Jasonia antiatlántica (Emb. and Maire) Gómiz,Jasonia antiatlantica (Emb. and Maire) Gómiz, J. glutinosa var. antiatlantica Emb. andMaire] is an Asteraceae endemic to southwestern Morocco (Figure 1F). It is characterizedby its thickened roots, linear-lanceolate leaves, entire and alternate, up to 45 × 5 mm,subspeciolate, with silky hairs and heterogamous capitula, with peripheral ligulate femaleflowers (Figure 2F). The plant is weakly hairy and grows on siliceous rocks [120].Finding specific and detailed information on C. antiatlanticus is a challenge, as it is nota widely documented plant in accessible sources. The only data concerning the chemicalcomposition and biological activities of this species were published in 2021. There is norecord of data prior to that date. Its chemical composition has been investigated, and thein vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of its essential oil. 27 metabolites were identifiedin the essential oil, including camphor and derivatives, borneol and camphene, as wellas intermedeol, α-pinene and (E)-pinocarveol [121]. Camphor and related metaboliteshave already been identified as major components of the essential oils of species of thesame genus, including C. montanus, collected in Egypt [65] and C. glutinosus, harvested inSpain [29,30]. They have also been identified in the essential oil of C. lopadusanus, endemicto the island of Lampedusa (Italy) [113].The study of the antimicrobial effect of the essences was positive against 24 Gram-positive strains, obtaining promising results against Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species.In addition, the essential oil also showed significant toxicity against different tumor celllines (liver HepG2 and melanoma B16 4A5) [121].There are no results published on the biological activity of the constituents isolatedfrom this species.4.7. Chiliadenus candicansC. candicans (Delile) Brullo [Chrysocoma candicans Delile, Jasonia candicans (Delile)Botsch., Linosyris candicans (Delile) DC., Varthemia candicans (Delile) Boiss.] is a perennialplant that has been widely recognized for its distinctive characteristics and its distributionin Mediterranean regions. After the reclassification of this species, based on taxonomicstudies and morphological and genetic analysis, it was placed in the genus Chiliadenus, sothat the currently accepted name for this plant is C. candicans (Cass.). Brullo. The nativerange of this species is Egypt, the Gulf countries, Libya, Palestine, Sinai, and up to theArabian Peninsula (Figure 1G) [6].There are no published data on its traditional medicinal use.4.7.1. PhytochemistryMethoxylated flavonoids were isolated from the leaves of this species 6,4′-dihydroxy-3,5,7-trimethoxyflavone (6-hydroxykaempferol 3,5,7-trimethyl ether) (61) and 3′-hydroxy-3,5,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (quercetagetin 3,5,7,4′-tetramethyl ether) (62), besides thealready known, luteolin (63), isokaempferide (64), penduletin (65), jaceidin (23), and methylethers of 6-hydroxykaempferol and quercetagetin [122].Continuing the phytochemical study and the search for bioactive compounds fromthis species, these same authors reported the isolation and structural elucidation ofseven sesquiterpenes, jasonol (66), a tricyclic eudesmane, two 7-epi-eudesmanes, 12-hydroxyisointermedeol (67) and 7-epi-ilicic acid (68), two guaianolides, lβ-hydroxy-8-epi-inuviscolide (69) and 5α-hydroxy-10,14-dihydroinuviscolide (70), the iphionane derivativeand the cadinane-triol (71). They also isolated other compounds already known, suchas iso-intermedeol (72), pseudo-ivalin (73), 8-epi-inuviscolide (74) and 5β-hydroxy-4-oxo-ll(13)-dehydroiphionan-12-oic acid (75) [123].Plants 2025, 14, 205 32 of 42Moreover, other sesquiterpenes, as well as the already known constituents confertin(76), 4,11(13)-eudesmadien-12-oic acid (77), and 11-eudesmen-4-ol (78), were isolated andidentified in the Et2O/CH3OH extracts. In addition, two new diol α-methylene lactoneantimicrobial agents were identified from NMR, MS and X-ray crystallography data as(4α,5α,8β,10β)-4,10-dihydroxy-1, 11(13)-guaidien-12,8-olide (79) and (4α, 5α, 8β,10α)-4,10-dihydroxy-1,11 (13)-guaidien-12,8-olide (80), which differ in stereochemistry at the C-10tertiary alcohol centre (Table 5) (Figure 9) [124].Table 5.

They evaluated the effect on several biochemical and physiological parametersand found anticholinesterase activity and reduction of TNF-α levels, as well as antioxidantand anti-inflammatory properties. The extract also exhibited anti-amyloidogenic potentialand neurotrophic effects, significantly reducing amyloid plaque formation in the brain andimproving brain insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and NF-κB levels [84].In another study, CH2Cl2 extract of the aerial part of J. candicans significantly reducedcell viability in the drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM leukaemia cell line. The author suggeststhat this is a promising cytotoxic extract that could be used to combat cancer cells with amulti-drug resistance phenotype through different cell death pathways [125].There are no results published on the biological activity of the pure constituentsisolated from this species.4.8. Chiliadenus hesperiusC. hesperius (Maire and Wilczek) Brullo (Jasonia hesperia Maire and Wilczek) [6] isendemic to Morocco (Figure 1H). It is a perennial plant, somewhat woody at the base,which grows in rock crevices. It has elliptic-oblong or lanceolate leaves, covered with densesilvery-sericeous indumentum. It has capitula with a yellow ligule (Figure 2G).Maire and Wilczek [126] described J. hesperia, a plant collected in the Tachilla jbel,as a new species. Brullo (1979) gives the species as good, although transferring it to thegenus Chiliadenus. Pardo de Santayana and Morales (2004) provisionally include the speciesin question as a synonym of J. rupestris Pomel, based on the affinity that, according tothe authors, both plants present. Subsequently, Gómiz and Morales (2006) confirmed thespecific independence of J. hesperia from J. rupestris [120].There are no published data in the literature on traditional uses of this species. Neitherhas it been investigated from a phytochemical point of view, nor from the point of view ofits biological activities.4.9.

DiscussionThe comprehensive analysis conducted in this review highlights the importance ofthe genus Chiliadenus in ethnopharmacology, underlining its role as a rich and diversesource of bioactive compounds with significant therapeutic potential. Comparative studyof the chemical composition and pharmacological activities of the component speciesreveals significant differences between them, reflecting their diverse therapeutic potential.For example, C. montanus stands out for its high concentration of flavonoids and phenoliccompounds, responsible for its remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabeticactivities. These properties coincide with its traditional use in Egyptian medicine to treatdigestive and kidney disorders. The link between its bioactive compounds and the observedtherapeutic actions is clear, which allows validation of its ethnopharmacological use in thetreatment of various diseases.In the case of C. glutinosus, there is a clear correlation between its traditional ethnophar-macological uses and the biological activities reported in the literature. This plant has beentraditionally used to treat a wide range of conditions, including digestive, respiratory andcirculatory problems, and for the relief of joint and rheumatic pain. Scientific studies haveconfirmed several of these applications, highlighting its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant andantispasmodic properties. The anti-inflammatory activity found for C. glutinosus extractscould justify their use in the treatment of rheumatic conditions and digestive disorders. Inaddition, its antioxidant action supports its traditional use in the relief of respiratory andcirculatory problems, as these conditions are often associated with oxidative stress.The same applies to C. iphionoides. This species was traditionally employed in MiddleEastern traditional medicine for digestive, inflammatory and respiratory disorders. Scien-tific studies have supported these uses, demonstrating that it possesses anti-inflammatory,antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that coincide with its ethnopharmacologicalapplications. Likewise, studies conducted with C. bocconei have shown that it possessesantimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which supports its traditional use in the treatmentof infections and digestive problems.In contrast, species such as C. candicans, C. antiatlanticus, C. rupestris, C. hesperius andC. sericeus show a notable absence of ethnopharmacological data, which could be attributedto limited historical documentation or to the limited use of these plants in traditionalmedicine. In this regard, C. candicans is an interesting exception, since, despite having nodocumented history of traditional uses, it has been the subject of extensive phytochemicalstudies. The foregoing suggests that scientific research on this species has been drivenmore by its geographic distribution or unique morphological characteristics than by priorpopular knowledge, highlighting the need to further explore its therapeutic potential.The correlation observed between traditional uses and biological activities reportedfor some species underlines the validity of ethnopharmacological knowledge. However, forthose species without traditional use data, more detailed ethnographic and pharmacologicalstudies are crucial.On the other hand, this review also highlights certain gaps in the current research.Despite significant advances in the identification of bioactive compounds, most studiesPlants 2025, 14, 205 37 of 42have focused on in vitro assays, leaving a considerable gap in in vivo evaluation andclinical studies. This limitation is critical, as the activity observed in in vitro studies doesnot always translate into clinical efficacy, underscoring the need for further research inanimal models and human trials to confirm Chiliadenus’ therapeutic potential.Finally, the review highlights a persistent problem in the taxonomy of the genusChiliadenus, where confusions and synonymies between species have hindered an accuratecharacterisation of their distribution and properties. This situation not only complicatesthe correct identification of species in pharmacological studies, but may also have led tothe underestimation of the potential of certain species within the genus.6. Conclusions and PerspectivesThis review underscores the promising therapeutic potential of the genus Chiliadenus,particularly in relation to its rich array of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, terpenes,and essential oils. The findings support the traditional uses of these species in folk medicine,especially for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antitumor properties,which have been confirmed through in vitro studies.Despite these encouraging results, several important areas require further investigationto fully realize the therapeutic potential of Chiliadenus species. First, in vivo studies andclinical trials are critical to validate the efficacy and safety of Chiliadenus compounds. Whilethe in vitro evidence is promising, clinical research is necessary to assess their real-worldapplications and determine the appropriate dosages and safety profiles for therapeuticuse. This is an essential step towards the incorporation of these compounds into modernmedical treatments.Second, the taxonomic classification of Chiliadenus must be clarified to avoid anyconfusion regarding species identification. Correctly identifying the species is crucial foraccurately assessing their pharmacological potential and ensuring that future researchis based on reliable data. The current ambiguities in species classification could lead toinconsistencies in study results, hindering progress in this field.Finally, to maximize the therapeutic use of Chiliadenus, a more integrative approachis necessary. Future research should combine efforts from multiple disciplines, includingchemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, molecular biology, and ecology. Moreover, collabora-tive studies involving researchers from different regions where Chiliadenus species grownaturally would provide valuable insights into their ecological and cultural significance.This interdisciplinary approach will not only strengthen the scientific evidence behind thetraditional uses of these plants but also uncover new bioactive compounds with potentialclinical applications.In conclusion, Chiliadenus represents an underexplored yet highly promising genusfor the development of novel therapeutic agents. With comprehensive, multidisciplinaryresearch, these species could make significant contributions to modern medicine whilepreserving their cultural and ecological value.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, L.V.C. and C.Z.A.; writing—original draft preparation,L.V.C.; literature retrieval, L.V.C. and C.Z.A.; review supervision and editing, L.V.C., C.Z.A. andF.Z.G.
