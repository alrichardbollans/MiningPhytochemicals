ABSTRACT  
The oldest remedies identified to mankind are herbal medicines. India is recognized worldwide for its Ayur vedic treatment. India 
has rich history of using many plants for medicinal purposes.  Remedial plants are cooperating extremely dynamic position in customary 
drugs for the action of a variety of illness. However a key obstacle, which has hindered the promotion in use of alternative medicines in 
the developed countries, is no evidence of documentation and absence of stringent quality control measures.  There is a demand for 
the evidence of every investigate effort execute on conventional remedies in the appearance of certification. The purpose of current review is 
to make accessible up-to-date information on, botany, morphology, ecological biodiversity, therapeutic uses, phytochemistry and 
pharmacological activities on diverse parts of Silybum marianum (L.) Gae rtn (S. marianum). This review was assembled using 
technical literature from electronic search engine such as Springer link, Bio Med Central, Pub Med, Scopus, Science Direct, S cielo, 
Medline and Science domain. Supplementary texts were obtained from books,  book chapters, dissertations, websites and other 
scientific publications. S. marianum a member of the Asteraceae family, is a tall herb with large prickly white veined green leaves 
and a reddish-purple flower that ends in sharp spines. It is native of the Mediterranean region and which has also spread in East 
Asia, Europe, Australia and America. It is grown as a commercial crop in several countries, including Iran and Pakistan.  Confident 
chemical constituents were exposed cognate as silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silychristin, silydianin, apigenin 7-O-β-(2″- 
O-α-rhamnosyl)galacturonide, kaempferol 3-O-α-rhamnoside-7-O-β-galacturonide, apigenin 7-O-β-glucuronide, apigenin 7-O-β-
glucoside, apigenin 7-O-β-galactoside, kaempferol-3-O-α-rhamnoside, kaempferol,  taxifolin and quercetin. The plant is exclusively 
used as anti-diabetic, hepatoprotective, hypocholesterolaemic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and as an anti-
oxidant. Seeds of the plant are also used as an anti -spasmodic, neuroprotective, anti-viral, immunomodulant, cardioprotective, 
demulcent and anti-haemorrhagic. The plant is also serves as a galactagogue, agent that induces milk secretion and used in the 
treatment of uterine disorders. The plant is employed in dissimilar conventional schemes of remedy in the cure of different illness. The 
present paper enumerates the Pharmacognostic, morphological and ethnobotanical, pharmacological importance of the S.

Introduction 
Plants are used for a variety of purposes. The history of 
natural products is relatively old and dates back to the 
time when the early man became conscious of his 
environment. Cultured and civilized man is said to have 
been on earth for some two or three million years and 
he has struggled for his life during the greater portion  
of the era. Thousands of years’ effort by examination 
much has thought him to distinguishes between useful 
and harmful plants. Since then herbs have been used in 
all cultures as an important source of medicine 1. The 
history of human culture and civilization of Egypt,

Assyrian, China, and Indies valley, knows that the elders 
and wise man of those times used medicinal plants to 
treat many diseases. In sequence regarding these remedial 
plants is there in the previous text, mythological stories, 
folklore, medicinal treaties, epic poems and thousand 
years’ old manuscripts, copper plates and palm leaves 
and other information on these cultures which are 
preserved even today. The unearth of Shanidar cave in 
Iraq in 1963 opened the grave of a Neanderthal man 
buried sixty thousand years ago along with so many 
flowers of his time. The plants there in the severe were 
afterward recognized to have numerous remedial assets2.  
Medicinal plants are the only inexpensive and reachable 
source of primary health care for them, particularly in 
the lack of access to contemporary medical facilities. 
Studies divulge that there are more conventional 
medicine providers than allopathic providers, 
particularly in rural areas3. Plant-resulting materials have 
recently befallen a huge consideration due to their adaptable 
appliances. Remedial plants are the wealthiest bio reserve of 
drugs of conformist structures of medication, food 
supplements, folk medicines, contemporary medicines, 
pharmaceutical intermediates and chemical entities for 
synthetic drugs4.  
Medicinal plants form a huge group of inexpensively 
significant plants that provide the essential raw 
materials for indigenous pharmaceuticals5. Plant 
products still remain the most important source of 
pharmaceutical agents used in conventional medicine6. 
According to the WHO the primary step for recognition 
and purification of herbal drugs is the pharmacognostic 
(macroscopic and microscopic) studies that are 
necessary for any phytopharmaceutical products used 
for standard formulation7. Preliminary phytochemical 
studies are obliging in finding out chemical constituents 
in the plant material that may fine lead to their 
quantitative estimation8,9. Lately much concentration 
has directed towards extracts and biologically active 
compounds isolated from accepted plant species. In the 
present age of drug development and discovery of 
newer drug molecules, a lot of plant products are 
assessed on the basis of their conventional uses. The 
healing properties of medicinal plants are mostly due to 
the occurrence of various multifaceted chemical 
substances of dissimilar compositions which happen as 
secondary metabolites10. The most significant of these 
bioactive constituents of plants are steroids, tannins, 
alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds. 
Therefore, it is enviable to know the phytochemical 
composition of the plant material before testing its 
effectiveness for medicinal purpose. Plants are also main 
natural sources of medicinal compounds in present 
pharmacopoeias11. Indian Materia Medica comprises 
about 2000 drugs of natural origin and most of them are 
resulting from different conventional system and myths 
practices12. However, there are large numbers of plants, 
which have not been mentioned in these reports, in 
malice of their usage in the conventional and folk 
medicinal systems. S. marianum common name is milk 
thistle; it is an edible plant belongs to the Asteraceae 
family. It is an annual or biennial native to the 
Mediterranean regions of Europe, North Africa and the 
Middle East and in some parts of USA13. In India, it is 
commonly found in Jammu and Kashmir14. It grows to a 
height of three to ten feet with an erect stem that bears 
large, alternating, pricklyedged leaves. 
The common name, milk thistle, is derived from the 
milky white veins on the leaves which, when broken 
open, yield a milky sap. Each stem bears single, large, 
purple flower ending in sharp spines. The fruit portion 
of the plant is glossy brown or drab with spots. 
The plant grows at altitude of 1800-2400m in rocky or 
sandy soil. The plant cherish with flowers in monsoon 
season from June to August15. Four different isomers 
were isolated from its secondary compound silymarin 
(silidianin isosilibinin, silibinin and silichristin) 16. S. 
marianum is hepatoprotectants for cancer Patients. 
Toleration of cancer therapy may progress from using 
this herb; reason is that it is blood and liver toxin 
clearing agents17. It has strong anticancer effects against 
breast, tumors, ectocervical and prostate 18. Against the 
ovarian cancer, it enhanced the effectiveness of 
doxorubicin and cisplatin in vitro experiment19. S. 
marianum has been used safely for children20, older21 
and pregnant women22. It is used in cholestatic, 
etiologies, viral, alcoholic and toxic effect removing 
medicines23. The taxonomical classification of S.

History  
The medical use of milk thistle has an extensive history. 
Theophrastus (c.371-287 BC), a Greek philosopher and 
successor to Aristotle, referred to milk thistle under the 
name of Pternix27. Pliny the Elder (23-79 C.E.) and 
Dioscorides (40-90 C.E.) both described this plant and 
its uses28. By the 16th century, milk thistle had become 
a favored medicine for hepatobiliary diseases29.In 1652, 
Nicholas Culpeper, a preeminent English herbalist, 
wrote The English Physitian, in which he noted milk 
thistle to be an excellent remedy for obstructions of the 
liver and the spleen30 .Milk thistle came to the Americas 
with the early European colonists. At the turn of the last 
century, the Eclectics, a group of herbalists, were using 
milk thistle extracts to treat liver, spleen, kidney and 
menstrual disorders31.Medical interest in this substance 
waned until the 1960s, when research studies primarily 
in Germany, re-focused attention on milk thistle and its 
constituents in the treatment of acute and chronic liver 
disease, and as a hepatoprotective agent to prevent 
toxic injury to the liver28. 
Occurrence and distribution   
Milk thistle is indigenous to the Mediterranean region 
and is widespread in Central Europe, Central, and 
Western Asia, North Africa, North and South America 
and Southern Australia 32, 33. It also grows in India, 
China, Africa and Australia. The plant was carried to 
North America by European colonists during the 19th 
century and is now naturalized in the United States and 
South America, Australia, China, and Central Europe 34. 
The plant was carried to North America by European 
colonists during the 19th century and is now naturalized 
in the United States and South America. Formerly 
cultivated in gardens, it is found in abandoned fields, old 
pastures and by the roadsides and, in some parts, is 
considered a problematic invasive weed and a target of 
classic biological control efforts35. It is commonly found 
in the provinces of Mazandaran, Gilan, West and East 
Azarbaijan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Fars and Bushehr 36. 
Ecology 
Milk thistle adapts with different conditions climates. It 
can be cultivated in northern climates such as Canada as 
well as in southern and arid conditions37, because it is 
hardy and adaptable38. Morazzoni and Bombardelli (1995) 
asserted that the uppermost substance of silybin, the chief 
constituent of silymarin, is establish in sows from 
subtropical climates and not from moderate ones, 
because higher temperatures seem to enhance the 
accumulation of that compound. Milk thistle grows well 
and has a good yield on different soil types 39-41. Milk 
thistle is normally considered to be a weed that grows 
along roadsides and on wastelands42 and reported as 
being a noxious weed in several countries because it 
competes with crops both for water and for nutrients43. 
Milk thistle proliferates best in nitrogen-rich media such 
as dairy yards, chicken coop waste, garbage dumps and 
abandoned agricultural fields40. The silymarin content in 
fruits depends on the milk thistle variety and geographic 
and climatic conditions in which they grow. However, 
the highest content of silybinin as the main component 
of silymarin is found in subtropical climates rather than 
from temperate climates36, 40. Milk thistle is a nitrate 
accumulator and can be lethal when livestock ingests the 
plant, particularly in the early wilting stage 44. 
Growing period 
Milk thistle grows as a winter annual or biennial herb, 
depending on climate. Germination occurs in autumn 
and spring34. Studies have shown that milk thistle seed 
germination is affected by light and temperature 
conditions42. Fresh milk thistle seeds seem to need an 
after-ripening period and germinate better at low 
temperatures compared to high temperatures. The seeds 
remain viable for 9 years or more. Young (1978) 
expressed that the incubated seeds in higher 
temperatures need for the longer after ripening 
period45. Melnikova (1983) reported that the minimum 
and maximum constant germination temperatures for S. 
marianum are 10 and 35°C and optimum germination 
occurs at 20-25°C45. Ghavami and Ramin (2007) 
reported that the percentage of germination at 15°C 
was higher than in 25 and 35°C46. After the seedling 
establishment, milk thistle overwinters as a rosette and 
in the meanwhile basal leaf number were increasing. In 
late winter and early spring, milk thistle enters into the 
flowering stage when it receives a stimulus from low 
temperatures. Flowers a thesis occurs from April-May. 
The achenes (fruits) are ripe in July. The whole growth 
period of milk thistle was 125-140 day, which could be 
divided into the seedling stage (15-20 day), vegetative 
stage including two stages: rosette stage and stem 
elongation (45 - 60 day), flowering stage, fruit-bearing 
stages, and withering stages34. Within a capitulum, 
anthesis usually lasted five days. Ripe fruits were 
released about 17 days later. Individual plants had the  
potential to produce an average of 55 capitulum 47. A 
single seed head can produce around 100-190 seeds. 
Flavonolignan accumulation in seeds depends on the 
stage of flower development and is maximum at the late 
flowering time41. 
Morphology 
S. marianum is an annual or biennial tubby, a rigid herb 
that is also wide and jagged. Unwieldy badge basal leaves 
produce up in its primary period, which reclines shut to the 
ground. It rises to a height of 2.5 meters and a width of 
0.9 meters. Each plant produces up to four stems which 
are hollow, spherical and be full of milky white sap.  It 
has big leaves that are wide and glossy green. They are 
distinct with white vein like marking, having spiny 
boundaries. 
The grown-up leaves have deeper lobes with a wavier 
margin, while the young leaves are shallowly lobed with 
spin. The flowers of S. marianum are blue or white in 
color, thistle like and single. They have many tubular 
florets that are about 6 cm in diameter and are 
bordered by rigid bracts that end in sharp spines. After 
flowering, white, thick feathery thistledown develops 
and spreads the seeds. Seeds are obliquely obovoid and 
are 6-7 millimeters long and 3 millimeters wide. The 
color of the seeds is brown and has a yellowish 
extrapolative enlarged ring at its tip and a canaliculated 
hilum at other end2. In general, two types of S. 
marianum occur in some areas of Asia including purple 
flowers and white flowers. Single capitalism can 
produce up to 200 florets with color ranging from 
magenta to purple. In slash from corner to corner, the fruit 
demonstrates a thin, chocolate external region and 2 big, 
opaque, white oily cotyledons. Too the fruits are an

lipid and is gorgeous to ants and thus aids seeds dispersion. 
A significant dependence between the shapeliness of 
the fruits and the mass of 1000 fruits was indicated that 
biggest fruits had the highest mass and best vigor. 
Seeds in the secondary flower heads had a 
conspicuously lower weight, when compared to the 
primary ones. The plant size at the first bloom was reduced 
by postponing the sowing period from October to February. 
The same decreasing trend was observed in the number of 
flower heads and in the number of days required for the first 
bloom48.

aperient. Juvenile leaves dish up as salad and blossoming 
skulls are inspired by diabetics. Seeds: Seeds are pungent,  
demulcent and antispasmodic. They are used for the 
treatment of jaundice and calculi of liver and gall-
bladder and are useful in controlling hemorrhages.  
Alcoholic extracts of the seed and to a lesser extent of 
the plant together, increase the peristalsis of the small 
intestine and galenical preparations, both of the seed 
and oil are mild purgative. Seeds are used as a 
substitute for coffee55. Its flowers, leaves, and roots 
have been used as European diets as a vegetable, and 
its achene is used as a coffee. It considered a spinach 
substitute. The flower head is used for medicine. It is 
used as a remedy for Amanita mushroom toxins56. 
Mechanisms of action  
Silymarin’s hepatoprotective effects are accomplished 
via several mechanisms including antioxidation, 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation and enhanced liver 
detoxification via inhibition of Phase I detoxification 
and enhanced glucuronidation and protection of 
glutathione depletion. 
Reading have also revealed silymarin displays numerous 
anti-inflammatory property, including inhibition of 
leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis, Kupffer cell 
inhibition, mast cell stabilization, and inhibition of 
neutrophil migration. In addition, silymarin has been 
shown to increase hepatocyte protein synthesis,  
thereby promoting hepatic tissue regeneration. Animal 
studies have also demonstrated silybin reduces the 
conversion of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblasts,  
slowing or even reversing fibrosis. Clinical studies 
conducted in Hungary also demonstrated silymarin to 
have immunomodulatory effects on the diseased liver 57. 
Pharmacokinetic  
Not solubility in water of Silymarin, making tea 
preparations ineffective; therefore it is usually 
administered orally in encapsulated form. Since 
incorporation of silymarin from the GIT is only temperate 
(23-47%), it is best administered as a standardized 
extract of 70-80 percent silymarin. In animals and 
humans, peak plasma levels are reached in four to six 
hours after an oral dose. Silymarin is excreted 
primarily via the bile but some clearance is also 
achieved via the kidneys. The clearance half-life of 
silymarin is six to eight hours58,59. 
Dosage/toxicity  
S. marianum is typically given as a homogeneous extract (70-
80% silymarin) in encapsulated form, 100-300mg 3 times 
every day being the characteristic adult dose. Both animal 
and human studies have shown silymarin to be non-
toxic. At high doses (>1500 mg per day) a laxative 
effect is possible due to increased bile secretion and 
flow. Mild allergic reactions have also been noted but 
were not serious.

Conclusion 
S. marianum is one of the most important medicinal 
plants grown in the world. This article reviews the 
phytochemistry, pharmacological, therapeutic 
applications and traditional knowledge of the plant S. 
marianum. The plant had been extensively used as a 
medicinal and legendary plant for a long period of time. 
S. marianum has attracted substantial attention due to 
its outstanding benefits. Pharmacological investigation on 
flavonolignans have been carry out in vitro and also 
urbanized in vivo in animal models and human experiments. 
Though several pharmacological mechanisms related to 
biological activity have already been explained, the 
comprehensive pharmacological mechanisms of the S. 
marianum need to be elucidated. Based on 
phytochemical and pharmacological research, the 
silymarins responsible for the good anti-diabetic, anti-
amnesia, hepatic-protective activities were selected as 
chemical markers to evaluate the quality of the S. 
marianum and its products. 
Though, pharmacokinetics investigations on the chief 
constituents, particularly the bioactive constituents are silent 
mainly absent, so unyielding confirmation for more scientific 
claim is essential in regulate to review the therapeutic
