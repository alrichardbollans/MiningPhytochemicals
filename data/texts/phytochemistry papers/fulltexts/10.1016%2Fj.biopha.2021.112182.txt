Nigella sativa L. is one of the most extensively used traditional medicinal plants. This widely studied plant is 
known to display diverse pharmacological actions, including antimicrobial activities. Current literature has 
documented its multi-target mode of antimicrobial actions. N. sativa or its bioactive compounds, such as thy-
moquinone, can induce oxidative stress, cell apoptosis (by producing reactive oxygen species), increase mem-
brane permeability, inhibit efflux pumps, and impose strong biocidal actions. Despite its well-documented 
antimicrobial efficacy in the experimental model, to the best of our knowledge its antimicrobial mechanisms 
highlighting the multi-targeting properties have yet to be well discussed. Is N. sativa or thymoquinone a valuable 
lead compound for therapeutic development for infectious diseases? Are N. sativa’s bioactive compounds po-
tential antimicrobial agents or able to overcome antimicrobial resistance? This review aims to discuss the 
antimicrobial pharmacology of N. sativa-based treatments. Additionally, it provides a holistic overview of the 
ethnobotany, ethnopharmacology, and phytochemistry of N. sativa.   
1. Introduction 
Infectious diseases (IDs) are among the top ten deadly diseases 
globally, and the menace of growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has 
challenged and reduced the effectiveness of most clinical antibiotics [1]. 
Irrational use of antibiotics causes an increased rate of AMR, resulting in 
high AMR-related deaths globally [2]. For example, methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infected patients are 64% more likely to 
die than patients infected with drug-sensitive strains [1]. Additionally, 
host susceptibility changes and altering the genetic makeup of micro-
organisms themselves have caused a remarkable growth of AMR 
worldwide [3]. 
A multi-target drug approach could be a sustainable strategy to 
overcome AMR problems, because bacterial resistance to single-target 
antibiotics develops too rapidly to be sustainable, and resistance to 
new drugs often develops even before they reach the market [4].

Therefore, the current drug discovery trend has changed from “one--
molecule-one-target-one-disease” to “one molecule-multi-targets modula-
tion.” Naturally, plant-derived molecules possess the ability to 
multi-target as they fight against predators like bacteria, fungi, vi-
ruses, insects, and herbivores, from their germination to maturity stages, 
and undergo challenging defense mechanisms for survival [5-7]. So, 
instead of developing new antibiotics, exploring potential antimicrobial 
agents from plant sources is convenient and cost-effective. Moreover, 
access to plant sources is easy and reliable since about 75–80% (more 
than six billion) of the world’s population depends on traditional 
medicine-based health care, especially in the less developed and 
developing countries of the world [8–10]. 
Nigella sativa L. (NS) is a potent medicinal plant used since ancient 
times that has been investigated widely to prove its traditional claims. 
The seeds or extracted oil of NS are traditionally used alone or in com-
bination with other products like honey, lint, melted butter, and as-
tringents in Islamic medicine, ayurvedic medicine, Unani traditional 
medicine, and indigenous medicine. They are used for various diseases 
or health conditions, including abdominal disorders, abscesses, 
anorexia, worm infections, asthma, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, 
chronic headache, colic, coryza, coughs, dermatosis, diabetes, diar-
rhoea, dispiritedness, eye infections, fatigue, fever, galactopoiesis, 
headaches, haemorrhoids, hypertension, jaundice, liver ailments, 
metabolic syndrome, nasal ulcers, obesity, orchitis, pulmonosis, repro-
ductive disorders, respiratory infections, rheumatism, sinusitis and sore 
eyes, and also as a stimulant for body energy [11–15]. 
The therapeutic effects of NS are due to its richness in several phy-
tochemicals, nutritionally vital constituents, and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFA). NS oil is on the United States Food and Drug Adminis-
tration’s (FDA) “Generally Recognized as Safe” list. It has multiple 
bioactive molecules, including thymoquinone (TQ), p-cymene, α-thu-
jene, carvacrol, β-pinene, limonene, methyl linoleate, sabinene, D- 
limonene, 4,5-epoxy-1-isopropyl-4- methyl-1-cyclohexene, and 4- 
terpineol [16–19], of which TQ exerts many pharmacological activ-
ities, including antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, anticancer, 
anti-histaminic, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant [20]. 
It also significantly inhibits the formation of biofilm, which increases 
AMR in antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms [21,22]. This action 
probably increases the production of reactive oxygen species in bacterial 
cells. 
Antimicrobial activities of NS or its secondary metabolites have been 
reported. TQ and other bioactive compounds produce ROS, which 
prompts oxidative stress and cell apoptosis [22] or increases bacteria 
membrane permeability, thereby promoting the influx of antimicrobial 
substances [23]. Nigellidine has a binding capacity to N-terminus pro-
tease and nucleocapsid, and inhibits viral growth [24]. Some other 
compounds, such as α-hederin and thymohydroquinone, bind to the 
ACE2 receptor and disrupt viral host interaction [25]. The essential oil 
of NS (1.5 mg/ml) inhibits the production of mycelia (67.4%) and 
aflatoxin in Aspergillus parasiticus and TQ generates oxidative stress in 
Candida glabrata [26,27]. Additionally, NS shows strong biocidal prop-
erties against parasites [28]. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, 
including many clinical trials, have demonstrated the therapeutic effi-
cacy of NS against IDs [20,21,27,29–33]. Is NS or TQ a valuable lead 
compound for therapeutic development for IDs? Are NS’s bioactive 
compounds potential antimicrobial agents or able to overcome AMR? 
This review aims to answer these questions by considering the various 
contributing mechanisms to the antimicrobial pharmacology of 
NS-based treatment. Additionally, this review provides a holistic over-
view of the ethnobotany, ethnopharmacology, and phytochemistry of 
NS, prior to exemplifying its antimicrobial properties and involved 
mechanisms. Key references are cited to illustrate the concept of 
mechanisms of NS’s antimicrobial actions and are not meant to be 
comprehensive. 
2. Methodology 
Literature was searched using electronic databases, including 
PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), ScienceDirect 
(http://www.sciencedirect.com/), Scopus (http://www.scopus.com/), 
Web of Science (https://apps.webofknowledge.com/), and advanced 
search in Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com.my/), as well as 
recognized books, abstract, and thesis/dissertation. The following key-
words are "Nigella sativa", “Black seed”, Black cumin”, "antimicrobial", 
"anti-bacterial", "antiviral", "antifungal", and "anti-parasitic" were used 
to search the literature. A combination of keywords was used in search 
engines during the literature survey from years 1951–2021. The relevant 
papers from the list of references of all retrieved available articles were 
also searched in the aforementioned databases mentioned above. Other 
relevant papers from the list of references of all available articles were 
also searched. All structures of chemical constituents have been drawn 
using ChemDraw Professional 16.0 software (PerkinElmer). The upda-
ted international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) names of 
isolated compounds of this plant were check-in the PubChem database. 
3. Nigella sativa 
3.1. Origin and global distribution 
The origin of NS is not well documented. Most probably, NS is 
indigenous to the Mediterranean region [34]. As the seeds of this plant 
were first discovered in Tutankhamun’s tomb in Egypt in the 18th dy-
nasty (1549/1550–1292 BCE) [35], it implies that the origin of this 
plant is Egypt and its adjoining regions. However, NS is distributed 
globally and cultivated in many countries and regions of the world, 
including, but not limited to, the Middle Eastern Mediterranean region, 
Central and Southern Europe, the former Soviet Union (Baltic states, 
Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Transcaucasia), Northern Af-
rica, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, India, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia [36, 
37]. The plant is commercially grown in many north Indian states, and 
India is the world’s largest producer and exporter of NS [36,38].

3.3. Plant description 
NS is an erect, herbaceous flowering plant with a stiff and multi- 
branched stem and a well-developed taproot. The agro-morphological 
traits of NS are distinguishable from other herbaceous plants as well 
as different accessions of NS. The detailed agro-morphological traits of 
NS [38,40,41] are presented in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the anatomy of NS 
[34]. The different body parts are also indicated clearly, including the 
cross and transverse sections of the fruits and seeds (Fig. 1).

3.4. Vernacular names 
The vernacular name— in other words, local name, common name or 
non-Latin name—of a plant or animal is derived from the common 
native speech of everyday life that is distinguishable from the binomial 
nomenclature. This name originated based on plant morphology, habit 
and habitat, organoleptic properties, and therapeutic uses. Generally, 
medicinal plants are traded with their vernacular names [42]. There-
fore, knowing the vernacular names is crucial for folk-taxonomic iden-
tification. At the same time, it provides information on plant 
morphology and gives information on habit and habitat, organoleptic 
properties, and therapeutic actions of the medicinal plant. However, this 
nomenclature does not always correspond one-to-one with scientific 
plant names. For example, both Drypetes afzelii and Adansonia digitate are 
known as Kiri to the Susu or Soso people of Guinea and Sierra Leone, 
West Africa [42]. Such complications are prevalent for vernacular 
names. 
NS is commonly known as ‘black seed’ in English because the seeds 
usually turn black upon exposure to air. It is also referred to as ‘Alha-
bahat Alsawda’, ‘Habbatus Sauda’, and ‘Alkamoun Alaswad’, among the 
Muslim community, in reference to the colour of its seeds [43]. Other 
vernacular names of NS are presented in Table 2. The data were 
extracted from references [12,44,45]. 
3.5. Agronomic techniques 
Conventionally, NS is propagated via seeds [46]. The growing season 
of this crop varies extensively depending on the geographical location of 
the cultivation area. It is grown as a winter crop in the tropics, whereas 
in temperate regions it is grown as a spring-summer or autumn crop 
[47]. Several studies suggested that seeds sown in early spring, with a 
30 cm or 40 cm spacing and a depth of 2 cm, give a better yield [48] 
while the soil pH is 8.2 and rainfall is 790 mm [49]. 
The cultivation of NS is commonly seen in cold temperatures. 
However, seed dormancy is one of the significant setbacks in cultivating 
this plant [50]. Germination of NS seed is very low (12–15%), and 
stratification for three weeks has proven to be effective for breaking its 
dormancy and germination [46,48]. Furthermore, a temperature of 
12–18 ◦C and 60% soil moisture are suitable for massive seed germi-
nation [46]. In order to increase its grain size and oil content, one or two 
irrigations are recommended at the flowering and seed formation stage 
[45]. 
There is a relationship of yield with genetic varieties of the same 
plant species [51]. Selection of the high yield of secondary metabolite 
varieties of NS and production through vegetative propagation is 
essential. Since seedlings have genetic variations, vegetative propaga-
tion, for example, adventitious rooting and plant tissue cultures [52,53], 
is recommended for mass-scale production. Environmental factors such 
as abiotic and biotic stress impact the yield of secondary metabolites 
[54–56]; these factors could also be considered for NS production. In 
some cases, abiotic stress, such as salinity stress, increases the yield of 
secondary lead compounds in plants [57], because stress conditions alter 
the metabolic pathway to accumulate the related metabolites to defend 
against adverse conditions [58,59]. NS plants manifest extreme vari-
ability in phytochemical profiles due to the adverse effects of changing 
climatic and environmental conditions [50,60]. For this reason, in vitro 
seed germination as well as vegetative propagation techniques are good 
choices for large-scale production of this plant with regular phyto-
chemical profiles under aseptic and controlled conditions. 
4. Ethnopharmacological uses 
NS has been commonly used for medicinal and culinary purposes for 
many centuries [61]. Therefore, it is essential to study the ethnobotany 
of NS due to its wide use in the different parts of the world, from gen-
eration to generation. Due to traditional knowledge and customs, 
different communities have developed unique practices concerning NS 
and its medicinal uses. 
4.1. Medicinal uses 
Traditional medicine practices like Unani, Ayurveda [37], and the 
Arabian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations have used NS for a long time 
due to its numerous benefits [62]. For example, in Ayurveda, NS is 
known to balance Vata (movement energy) and Kapha (structure and 
lubrication energy), and increase Pitta (metabolism or digestion en-
ergy). The therapeutic uses of NS seeds mentioned in the Unani system 
include stomachic, laxative, carminative and galactagogue, and to 
counter inflammation, ascites, jaundice, piles, tertian fever, paralysis, 
and eye diseases. It is also used to combat headaches, cough and asthma, 
and to expel kidney stones. 
4.2. Culinary and other traditional uses 
NS seeds have a pungent, bitter taste and aroma. They are used as a 
condiment in curries in many cultures. NS is used as a flavouring addi-
tive in bread and pickles, and is also added to tea, coffee, casseroles etc. 
The grounded NS seeds are usually sprinkled on salads or mixed with 
honey. NS is an ingredient of the spice mixture panch phoron, and the 
dry-roasted seeds are sometimes used to flavour curries, pulses, and 
vegetables [37,63]. 
NS seeds have also been used as a liver tonic, diaphoretic, diuretic, 
stomachic, emmenagogue, and control for parasitic infections [37,64]. 
NS can be combined with other ingredients to cure diarrhoea, dyspepsia, 
reflux, obesity and dyspnea, and to freshen breath. The seeds are taken 
with buttermilk to treat persistent hiccups and treat anorexia, vomiting, 
oedema, and puerperal diseases [63,64]. They are useful against mer-
cury poisoning, leprosy, flatulence, and polio [61,63], and can treat 
amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and skin eruptions. A tincture prepared 
from NS seeds has been proven to be useful [62]. It is also used as a 
vermifuge, and its oil extract is taken orally as a daily tonic due to its 
immunostimulant property [31,61]. 
Many people use the oil to treat skin conditions, including eczema,

psoriasis, and boils. Beeswax mixed with black seed oil is also used for 
skin infections, burns, joint pain relief, moisturizers, or anti-wrinkle 
agents [62,63]. The oil also has antiseptic properties and can be 
applied externally. To restore a lost sense of smell, dried pods are snif-
fed. They are used as insect repellents such as mothballs, and to preserve 
woollen fabrics from insect damage by scattering between the folds of 
fabrics [62]. 
4.3. Documentation of uses of Nigella sativa in religious and medical 
scripts 
The names of medicinal plants, their formulation, and their impor-
tance has been mentioned in religious books [65,66]. NS is mentioned in 
books including The Prophetic Medicine and the Bible – two significant 
books across the old and new testaments (Isaiah 28:25,27 and Matthew 
23:23). In the Bible, NS is cited more than any other plant. It is used in 
cancer treatment as well as in birth control [67]. NS is the curative 
“black cumin” in the Bible and is described as Melanthion by Hippo-
crates and Dioscorides, and as Gith by Pliny [68]. 
Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) narrated that NS seed can 
cure every ailment or illness except death (Al-Bhukhaari, 5688). Ibn 
Sina, also known as Avicenna in the west, who is famous for his book 
“The Canon of medicine,” advised about the use of NS. It helps the body 
recover from dispiritedness and fatigue and boosts the body’s energy 
[69]. Pedanius Dioscorides reported using NS seeds for food and ther-
apeutic purposes to treat diseases of the eyes, toothache, and leprosy, to 
increase urine, and to repel snakes. In Babylonia, the NS plant was used 
externally to treat swelling and bruises, and internally to treat stomach 
problems. The physician Assaf started its medical uses to treat colds in 
the chest, head and body, nose infections and bright skin spots, as well as 
to increase semen and virility, and to improve hair growth. It also served 
as a pharmaceutical constituent against venomous creatures’ stings and 
poisons [61]. In the history of Islamic medicine, NS is a “miraculous or 
blessed” plant. Muslim scholars went to tremendous lengths to explore 
the remedial features of this plant. Its importance is stated in “Prophetic 
Medicine” tradition. Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated 
that she heard the messenger of Allah (Peace Be Upon Him) saying: 
“There is healing in black cumin for every disease, except as-saam”. Ibn

Shihab said: As-saam is death [Sahih Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71, Hadith 
591; Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 4, Book of Medicine, Hadith 3449]. 
In the Hadith above, the formulation of NS is also clearly stated: 
“Take five or seven (seeds) and grind them to a powder, then drop them 
into his nose with drops of olive oil, on this site and on this site” for the 
treatment of sickness. It is stated in the books of Seerah that Nabi-e- 
Akram (Peace Be Upon Him) himself used to take black seed for thera-
peutic purposes together with honey syrup [70,71]. NS was ascertained 
by Suhar Bakht and called habb-i-Sajzi, Sigzi grains. 
The immense benefits of NS have been described by many ancient 
scholars, including ancient Greek physicians like Hippocrates (460–370 
BCE) and Dioscorides (40–90 CE), Galen (129–200/216 CE), Muslim 
scholars like Al-Biruni (973–1048) and Ibn Sina (980–1037) (Table 3). 
4.4. Use of Nigella sativa in modern medicine 
Many of the traditional or historical uses of NS have been scientifi-
cally examined. The medicinal importance and scientific quest of this 
plant can be understood from the findings of an advanced search in the 
PubMed database (as of 5 January 2021), with the cumulative publi-
cation record presented in Fig. 2. A systematic search using the 
following keywords (Nigella sativa[Title/Abstract]) OR (black seed 
[Title/Abstract]) retrieved 1534 journal articles, of which 1065 were 
from Medline only. Further filtration revealed 1365 journal articles, of 
which 67 are clinical trials in the PubMed database. Among the (sys-
temic) reviews, Medline covered only 97 out of 169 in PubMed. The 
plant has attracted more focus in recent years, as evidenced by the 
gradual upward trend of publications (Fig. 2). In the twentieth century, 
only 54 and 46 journal articles were published in the PubMed and 
Medline databases, respectively. This number has increased from the 
beginning of the twentieth century. In 2020 alone, 176 publications 
were included in PubMed, of which 17 articles are relevant to corona-
virus disease (COVID-19). As NS has prominent antiviral compounds, 
such as TQ, extensive investigation is in progress, including clinical 
trials. It has been reported that the antiviral action of TQ is equivalent or 
likely superior to chloroquinone and hydroxychloroquinone. TQ 
demonstrated a good safety profile, whereas chloroquinone and 
hydroxychloroquinone showed toxicity effects [72,73]. 
Extant literature also provides much-needed evidence to support NS 
usage. For example, Bamosa, Kaatabi, Lebdaa, Elq and Al-Sultanb [74] 
reported that the grounded NS (supplement of 2 gm/day for three 
months in 94 uncontrolled types-2 diabetes mellitus patients) produced 
significant improvement in glycemia and diabetes control laboratory 
parameters. NS also showed mnemonic or nootropic properties. Among 
the elderly, its commercially available capsules (500 mg, taken for nine 
weeks) were shown to increase executive functions, as shown by various 
memory-related tests (letter cancellation, logical memory, trail making, 
digit span, and Stroop tests) [75]. Taking 500 mg NS capsules daily for 
four weeks as a nutritional supplement reduces anxiety, improves 
memory, and stabilizes mood [43]. Other clinical studies revealed that 
NS has activity against allergic diseases. Commercially available black 
seed oil capsules with the brand name Immerfit® were applied to pa-
tients with allergic diseases. Each capsule contained 500 mg NS oil with 
1.5 mg β- carotene, 6 mg of vitamin E, and 70 μg biotin for stabilization. 
All study groups were given capsules at 40–80 mg/kg/day. The four 
studies showed that NS oil effectively relieved allergic disease symptoms 
(atopic, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, eczema) [76]. 
5. Chemical compositions and phytocompounds 
The following section outlines and discusses the chemical composi-
tion of NS, the activity of phytocompounds derived from NS, and 
structure–activity relationship of these active molecules. 
5.1. Chemical compositions 
NS seed contains a tiny amount of essential oils (0.4–1.49%), about 
30–45% fixed oils and other compounds (Table 4). The concentration of 
other compounds varies. NS contains amino acids, proteins, carbohy-
drates as well as bioactive molecules. 
The therapeutic efficacy of a plant depends on the phytocompounds

(secondary metabolites). Phytoconstituents are primary metabolites 
(involved with the life cycle, thus almost the same in all living cells) and 
secondary metabolites (products of subsidiary pathways, thus dealing 
with medicinal efficacy in the case of medicinal plants). They are not 
usually produced under the same conditions. In most cases, the specific 
function of the phytocompounds and their benefits to the organism itself 
are not yet known; however, they possess pharmacological properties 
that are beneficial for humans and animals’ health care systems. The 
distribution of secondary metabolites differs dramatically from one 
plant to another, and even different accessions of the same species 
possess varying quantities and qualities of pharmacologically active 
compounds [5,81–83]. 
5.2. Phytocompounds 
From NS, many phytoconstituents have been extracted, validated, 
and reported [44]. This review looked at available information on 171 
isolated phytoconstituents of NS with structure (Fig. 3), part used, 
extraction method and isolation techniques (Table 5). Among these 
metabolites, only seven compounds exhibited antimicrobial activities in 
experimental studies (Table 6). Only a few other compounds showed 
other pharmacological properties. For example, α-Hederin has potential 
as an anticancer agent [84]. It is effective against HEp-2 laryngeal cancer 
cells [85] and has antitumor properties [86]. It can also attenuate lung 
inflammation and improve cytokines [87]. Oleic acid and linoleic acid 
modulates the interaction of cardiac glycosides with the sodium pump 
[88], nigellidine possess immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant activities [89], and longifolene is effective as an insect re-
pellent [90]. But the pharmacological roles of a majority of the isolated 
pure compounds of NS in diverse health management are yet to be 
discovered, including IDs. However, the list of phytocompounds we 
have shown in this study might facilitate the researchers in drug dis-
covery, mainly through computational biology, which can select target 
candidates with the highest potential for successful disease recovery 
using bioinformatic tools. 
The highest number of metabolites has been isolated from seeds, 
followed by roots and shoots (Fig. 4a). These compounds were in 
different categories: alkaloids (1–12), fatty acids (13–25), polyphenols 
(26–54), phytosterols (55–60), terpenes and terpenoids (61–151), and 
others (152–171). Terpenes and terpenoids were the most predominant 
secondary metabolites, accounting for 53% of the identified molecules. 
Fig. 4b shows the prevalence of different types of phytocompounds of 
NS. For isolation of metabolites, different types of extraction methods, 
such as methanolic, ethanolic, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, 
diethyl ether, hot and cold water, supercritical carbon dioxide, hydro- 
distillation and microwave distillation, have been used for different 
parts of the plant (Table 5). 
Identification and characterization were done using various chro-
matography and spectroscopy methods, including thin-layer 
chromatography (TLC), column chromatography (CC), gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC), ultra HPLC/MS-MS (UHPLC/MS-MS), 
reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), and X-ray crys-
tallography (Table 5). 
5.2.1. Alkaloids 
A total of 12 alkaloids (1–12) were isolated from the seeds. The 
naturally occurring alkaloids of NS mainly have an indazole ring as a 
nucleus, such as migellicine and nigellidine. Nigellidine-4-O-sulfite is 
the first sulfated alkaloid of its type. Nigellimine and nigellimine n-oxide 
are isoquinoline alkaloids. Several dolabellane-type diterpene alkaloids, 
nigellamines A1–A5, were also isolated from NS [124,125]. Natural 
indazole-type alkaloids have only been obtained from NS, which means 
they are a potential taxonomic marker [126]. 
5.2.2. Fatty acids 
NS possesses different types of fatty acids that can be determined 
using GC-MS. Linoleic acid is the most predominant fatty acid (56%). 
Oleic acid is the second-highest fatty acid present (24.6%). Palmitic 
acid, stearic acid, eicosadienoic acid, linolenic acid and some other acids 
are also present in small amounts in NS seed oil (13–25) [127]. The 
determined fatty acids were 8% of the total identified molecules. 
However, some of these molecules have shown potential modulating 
properties where the cardiac glycosides interact with the sodium pump 
[88]. 
5.2.3. Polyphenols 
A total of 29 polyphenols have been identified from the seeds, roots 
and shoots of NS. From roots and shoots, they were identified using RP- 
HPLC, and from seeds using the UHPLC-MS/MS method. Among 29 
polyphenols, 17 compounds were phenolic acid (26–42), and the other 
12 were flavonoids (43–54). Ferulic acid and sinapinic acid were the 
major phenolic acid esters identified from NS seed extract. In contrast, 
vanillic acid was the primary phenolic compound in shoots (143.21 mg/ 
100 gm DW) and roots (89.94 mg/100 gm DW). Quercetin and 
kaempferol are the major flavonoid glycosides identified in NS seed 
extract, and catechin was the most abundant compound in roots 
(3.4 ± 0.74 mg/100 gm DW) and shoots (7.26 ± 0.97 mg/100 gm DW) 
[128,129]. 
5.2.4. Phytosterols 
The total sterol concentration ranges from 1993.07 mg/kg to 
2887.28 mg/kg in oil extracted from NS. β-sitosterol (44–54%) is the 
major sterol in NS seed oil. Stigmasterol (16.57–20.92%) is the second 
major sterol followed by δ-7-stigmasterol, δ-7-avenasterol, campesterol, 
and cholesterol (55–60) [130]. 
5.2.5. Terpenes and terpenoids 
More than 50% of compounds among the identified phyto-
compounds of NS were terpenes and terpenoids (Fig. 4). We found 91 
compounds belonging to the family of terpene (61–151). They include 
mono-terpene, di-terpene, sesquiterpenes, monoterpenoid alcohols and 
ketone. The major terpenes—TQ, trans-anethole, p-cymene, α-pinene 
and carvone—have been identified. TQ, the primary compound of NS, 
has a concentration of 388.61 µg/ml [117]. 
5.2.6. Others 
A study showed that NS comprises 21% protein, 35.5% fat, 5.5% 
moisture, and 3.7% ash and carbohydrate (rhamnose, xylose, and 
arabinose) [127]. It also contains triterpene saponin (171) (α-hederin), 
phenylpropanoids (eugenol, ε-cinnamaldehyde) and some alkane hy-
drocarbons (n-nonane, dodecanal etc.) (152–171).

6. Antimicrobial pharmacology of Nigella sativa 
Different extracts of NS, NS oil and several bioactive molecules of NS 
have been effective against infections caused by microbes, as supported 
by numerous in vitro studies. They have distinguishable antibacterial, 
antiviral, antifungal and anti-parasitic activities, as discussed below. 
6.1. Antibacterial activity 
Various studies revealed the antibacterial potential of NS. In a recent 
Fig. 3. Chemical structure of phytoconstituents of Nigella sativa. The compounds include alkaloids (1–12), fatty acid (13–25), polyphenol (26–54), phytosterol 
(55–60), terpenes and terpenoid (61–151), and others (152–171). 
Md.S. Hossain et al.

study, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% concentrations of NS oil were used in the 
agar diffusion technique against 24 spoilages, pathogenic, and lactic 
acid bacteria (LAB). The more effective concentration was 2.0% [131]. 
The lowest active concentration of NS oil was 0.5%. The concentration 
was not effective against Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Lb. casei ssp. 
casei, Leu. pseudomesenteroides or Weissella paramesenteroides. The most 
sensitive bacterium against all concentrations of NS oils was Aeromonas 
hydrophila, while the most resistant bacterium type was Y. enterocolitica 
(Table 7). In general, the antibacterial activity of fixed oils in NS samples 
against pathogenic bacteria and spoilage was higher than in LABs [131]. 
In another study of the antimicrobial activity of ethanol and hexane 
extracts of NS with the agar-well diffusion method, the extract’s 1.5, 3.0, 
4.5, and 6.0 mg/ml concentrations were tested and compared with 
Fig. 3. (continued). 
Md.S. Hossain et al.

standard antibiotics (tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and 
ampicillin). The ethanol extract showed an antibacterial effect against 
both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and the extract showed 
remarkable and robust activity against S. epidermidis, K. pneumonia fol-
lowed by Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, and Salmonella typhi-
murium (Table 7). The extract showed the best effect against B. subtilis, 
followed by B. cereus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The hexane extract 
was the most effective against B. subtilis, followed by S. epidermidis and 
B. cereus (Table 7) [132]. 
NS is also effective against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA), which is the most common pathogen encountered in laboratory 
practice as well as in clinics. MRSA has become a major health problem

worldwide. There were 99 clinical isolates of MRSA and ATCC strain 
25923 tested and compared with vancomycin (positive control). The 
study demonstrated that methanolic and chloroform NS extracts at 
4 mg/disk completely inhibited MRSA strains with a significant zone 
size of > 12 mm. However, these strains were not inhibited at 0.5 mg/ 
disk [133]. An ethanol extract of NS has been evaluated in vitro against 
Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis. In humans, these strains are 
known as causative agents of dental caries. The methanolic extract of NS

Md.S. Hossain et al.

also showed pronounced antibacterial activity (Table 7) [134]. Another 
study revealed that NS was effective against antibiotic-resistant Salmo-
nella enterica. Amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, 
and ampicillin-resistant S. enterica were also inhibited by methanol 
extract and NS seed oil in in vitro experiments [135]. 
The United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
listed 18 bacteria as urgent threats, severe threats and concerning 
threats, and listed three bacteria on the watch list [148]. Among these 
infectious agents, Clostridioides difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staph-
ylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Salmonella Typhi, Enterobac-
teriaceae and Acinetobacter as antibiotic-resistant bacteria were tested 
against different extracts of NS. These bacteria are responsible for 
various serious diseases. Fluoroquinolones-resistant Clostridioides diffi-
cile causes life-threatening diarrhoea. Carbapenems-resistant Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa is responsible for bloodstream, surgical site, urinary 
tract infections, pneumonia, and chronic lung disease [149].

Streptococcus pneumonia shows resistance to various antibiotics and is 
responsible for bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, bloodstream in-
fections, and ear and sinus infections. NS essential oil and other phy-
tochemicals (TQ, p-cymene, carvacrol) can modify the resistance 
potentiality of AMR bacteria and become sensitive. NS could be an 
excellent source of new antibacterial agents to achieve AMR 
stewardship. 
6.1.1. Mode of actions against bacteria 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have multidrug efflux 
pumps (EPs), which assist bacterial populations to enhance their im-
munity and survive when exposed to antimicrobial substances. The 
leading cause of MDR bacteria is EPs, a transporter of proteins involved 
in the removal of drugs and toxic substances to the external environment 
from the interior of the cell (Fig. 5a) [150,151]. In Listeria mono-
cytogenes, two efflux pumps have been identified [152]. One efflux pump 
called MdrL extrudes macrolides, cefotaxime, heavy metals, and EtBr. 
The other, Lde, extrudes fluoroquinolone, acridine orange, and EtBr 
[153,154]. NS oil, TQ, carvacrol, and its active compounds are efficient 
modulators of antibiotic resistance in L. monocytogenes. TQ and essential 
oil inhibit efflux pumps, increase the accumulation of antibiotics in the 
bacterial cells, and at lower doses, enhance their effectiveness [23]. TQ 
also intervenes in its antibacterial effect by producing ROS, prompting 
oxidative stress and cell apoptosis (Fig. 5b) [22]. On the other hand, 
p-cymene has no antimicrobial activity. However, it increases the 
membrane permeability, thereby promoting the influx of antimicrobial 
substances [23]. 
6.2. Antiviral and potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects with the mode of 
actions 
NS increases the helper T cell (T4 and T8) suppressor ratio and 
natural killer cells (NK) cell activity. It results in improved immunity, so 
shows a suppressing effect against human immune deficiency virus 
protease [44]. NS exhibits anti-influenza virus activity. It plays a pivotal 
role in diminishing the pathogenic effects by inducing efficient immune

responses [155]. Patients suffering from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infec-
tion exhibited notable improvement in HCV viral load using oil extrac-
ted from NS seed [69]. Regaining and seroreversion of HIV-positive 
patients can be achieved by using NS seeds [156]. NS oil potentially 
binds with murine cytomegalovirus that showed inhibition of viral 
growth in a rat model [157]. The ethanolic extracts of NS successfully 
reduced the viral load and death in embryonic chicken eggs against the 
Newcastle disease virus [158]. Recent studies revealed that NS has a 
high potential as a herbal antiviral agent against novel coronavirus 
[159]. DL-Arabinose is an important phytochemical found in NS with 
effective antiviral activity [160]. 
A recent study suggested that NS could be considered a natural 
substitute for chloroquine because it contains several bioactive compo-
nents such as TQ, dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, and nigelli-
mine activity, augmented by a Zn supplement [161]. Another in-silico 
study by molecular docking suggested that nigerlidine and α-hederin are 
the main compounds from NS that can prevent COVID-19 with the same 
or better score than drugs under clinical trials [162]. In another in-silico 
study, nigellidine showed the highest binding affinity to N terminus 
protease (− 7.61) and nucleocapsid and the main protease necessary for 
viral maturation in protein structures, RNA packaging, and other func-
tions. Moreover, binding to IL1 and TNF-α receptors may reduce cyto-
kine storm after viral infection [24]. α-hederin (− 6.265 kcal/mol) and 
thymohydroquinone (− 5.466 kcal/mol) are identified as suitable bind-
ing ligands to ACE2 receptors in the human system responsible for virus 
entry [25]. Among other compounds, dithymoquinone (DTQ), also 
known as nigellone, shows a binding affinity of − 8.6 kcal/mol 
compared to a positive control (chloroquine, − 7.2 kcal/mol), and has 
the promising ability of binding at the SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 interface to 
disrupt viral host interaction [159]. 
Oral administration of honey with NS reduced the severity of clinical 
symptoms, earlier viral clearance, and reduced mortality in COVID-19 
patients [163]. Taibah University started a novel evidence-based 
approach, “TaibUVID”, for COVID-19 treatment. A single TaibUVID 
dose includes one large spoonful of Nigella sativa oil (or 2 g of Nigella 
sativa seeds) mixed with one gram of ground anthemis hyaline and one 
large spoonful of natural honey. This mixture is to be chewed in the 
mouth and swallowed orally for COVID-19 close contacts and patients. It

is a promising evidence-based approach to decrease fatalities and 
rapidly end the COVID-19 pandemic [164]. 
6.3. Antifungal effects with the mode of actions 
NS has an inhibitory effect against different pathogenic yeasts 
(Table 8). The presence of β-sitosterol and oleic acid in the oil compo-
sition of NS is considered to be responsible for its antifungal activity 
[165]. In addition, S. Gupta [166] stated that different components of 
NS oil, such as stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, show antifungal properties 
against some pathogenic yeasts such as Candida tropicalis, Candida 
albicans, and Geotrichum candidum. An in vivo study in mice showed an 
antifungal activity of NS seeds’ aqueous extract against Candida albicans 
responsible for candidiasis [167]. Another study [168] showed that the 
candidacidal pathway in mice neutrophils is nitric oxide (NO)-depend-
ent. There is a possibility that the active ingredient(s) of the plant extract 
may stimulate granulocytes and monocytes to form nitric oxide, leading 
to excellent antifungal activity, which in turn kills C. albicans [169]. The

anti-yeast activity of NS seed extract is maximised at pH 7 and 30 ◦C 
[170]. 
The essential oil of NS possesses higher antidermatophytic activity 
[175]. Furthermore, an ether extract of NS seed and its active compo-
nent TQ showed some antifungal activity against dermatophytes: four 
species of Trichophyton rubrum and one each of T. interdigitale, 
T. mentagrophytes, Microsporum cani, and Epidermophyton floccosum. The 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the ether extract of NS was 
between 10 and 40 mg/ml, while that of TQ was 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml, 
inhibiting 80–100% fungal growth. [176]. NS oil exhibited significant 
effectiveness against non-dermatophytic filamentous fungi such as 
Drechslera hawiinesis, Alternaria alternate, and F. moniliforme, which were

inhibited entirely at 0.1% and 0.15% concentration [177]. 
In a study, NS showed maximum inhibition (76.1%) at 10% con-
centration against Macrophomina phaseolina, one of the most damaging 
phytopathogenic fungi causing charcoal rot disease (Iqbal et al., 2014). 
Ns-D1 and Ns-D2 are two novel antifungal defensins, isolated from seeds 
of NS, that exhibit intense divergent antifungal activity towards several 
phytopathogenic fungi [178]. 
The essential oil of NS (1.5 mg/ml) inhibits the production of 
mycelia (67.4%) and aflatoxin in Aspergillus parasiticus [26]. A study by 
Khosravi indicated that when Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigates 
were exposed to NS oils (2 mg/ml), they exhibited detachment of the 
fibrilar layer of the cell wall. The researcher also observed that the 
plasma membrane was separated from the cell wall, the cytoplasm was 
disrupted, and subsequently the cytoplasm was vacuolated, before the 
vacuole fused. Overall, oil from NS showed moderate to weak activity 
against aflatoxin-producing fungi [179]. 
6.4. Anti-parasitic activity with the mode of actions 
Studies have indicated that NS possesses significant anti-parasitic 
(anti-helminths, anticestodals, and anti-schistosomal) properties. NS 
seeds showed significant anticestodal activities. These easy-to-grow and 
affordable indigenous plant-based drugs are safe agents for treating 
children with roundworm and tapeworm infestations. The most effective 
oral doses were 40 and 50 mg per kg of body weight with no serious 
adverse effects [180]. The methanolic extract of NS seeds (1250 mg/kg) 
suppressed Plasmodium yoelii infection at a suppression rate of 94%, 
whereas the most effective synthetic drug, chloroquinone, had an 86% 
suppression rate. A 400 mg/kg of aqueous suspensions and oil emulsions 
of NS seeds were used to treat coccidiosis in rabbits. The emulsion has 
higher concentrations of alkaloid nigellicine that has a deadly influence 
on parasites [181]. NS oil effectively reduced the number of Schistosoma 
mansoni worms in the liver and reduced the total number of ova that 
accumulated in both the intestine and the liver. It has also been shown to 
be effective against other helminths such as Hymenolepis nana [182]. NS 
was tested against cercariae, miracidia, and adult worms of Schistosoma 
mansoni. It has demonstrated strong biocidal activity against all the 
stages of the parasite as well as an effect on the egg-laying activity of the 
adult female worms [28]. However, the molecular mechanisms of 
biocidal action of NS against parasites are yet be investigated. 
7. Safety and toxicity 
TQ is the main constituent of the volatile oil of NS seeds. Its seed 
extract and its constituents appear to have a low level of toxicity [31]. 
After oral administration of TQ, the demonstrated toxicity level was 
negligible. Oral TQ is bio-transformed into more minor toxic metabolites 
in the gastrointestinal tract or metabolized in the liver into 
dihydro-thymoquinone. After administration, the toxicity increases due 
to the complete absorption of TQ into the systemic circulation [183]. 
The treatment of male albino rats with an intraperitoneal administration 
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 
and then intragastric administration of NS oil or TQ on alternate days for 
12 days, initiated 6 h before or after a cyclophosphamide injection, 
showed that the treatment with cyclophosphamide induced significant 
toxicity while treatment with NS oil or TQ induced a significant reduc-
tion in overall toxicity [184]. The high values of oral and intraperitoneal 
lethal doses of NS fixed oil at 28.8 ml/kg of body weight show its low 
acute toxicity [185]. No toxicity was observed when NS oil was 
administered in different doses up to 10 ml/kg of body weight [186]. 
The acute toxicity of TQ is relatively low, and it is well-tolerated, 
generally, when given sub-chronically in drinking water at doses that 
are about 12 times the cytoprotective dose [187]. Another study 
involved oral administration of the aqueous, chloroform, and methanol 
extracts of NS seeds, in 6, 9, 14, and 21 g/kg. The methanol extracts in 
all four doses and chloroform extract at 21 g/kg significantly decreased 
animals’ weight. The study of the hepatic toxicity of the extracts at 
6 g/kg/day for 14 consecutive days, as well as a hepatic histological 
study, revealed no abnormal activity of ALP, SGPT, and SGOT in blood 
[188]. The supplementation of NS up to 1 g/kg for 28 days produced no 
changes in liver enzyme level and no toxicity effect on liver function 
[189]. TQ is beneficial for the prevention and protection of cisplatin 
nephrotoxicity in rodents. The oral administration of TQ (50 mg/L in 
drinking water) for five days before and five days after a single injection 
of cisplatin (5 mg/L in rats and 7 or 14 mg/l in mice) also greatly 
improved cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity [190]. The subacute toxicity 
evaluations of the aqueous, chloroform and methanol extracts of NS at 
6 g/kg showed no toxicity. However, the chronic toxicity study found 
slightly toxic 2 ml/kg NS fixed oil [191]. The high antioxidant potential 
of TQ is responsible for the reduction in related nephropathy toxicity 
[184]. 
8. Challenges and future directions 
NS has shown promising results against numerous chronic IDs, yet 
further investigation should be conducted using human clinical trials 
with standardized preparation and verification for its full therapeutic 
potency. Further in silico studies, preclinical, experimental evidence, and 
prospective studies are proposed to evaluate the phytotherapy potential 
of NS, particularly for emerging and novel diseases such as COVID-19. 
NS oil and essential oils for topical anti-ageing skincare formulations 
are also recommended due to their various pharmacological activities 
such as antioxidant, anti-ageing, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti- 
carcinogenic, anti-allergy, and moisturizing properties. Other novel 
extraction techniques, such as natural deep eutectic solvents, could be 
explored to identify new compounds from the various parts of NS plants, 
especially the seed. 
9. Conclusion 
This review presents a succinct summary of the antimicrobial effects 
of NS, a medieval armamentarium worth further clinical exploration in 
modern medicine. Various crude extracts from different solvents have 
been reportedly established as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and 
anti-parasitic agents. NS oil, TQ, carvacrol, and other active compounds 
are efficient modulators of AMR bacteria. NS oil and TQ inhibited efflux 
pumps, resulting in the high accumulation of antibiotics in bacterial 
cells. Ultimately bacteria become sensitive and die. This action can be 
valid even at lower doses. TQ facilitates the production of ROS, pro-
motes oxidative stress, and thereby occurs cell apoptosis. Another potent 
compound of NS, p-cymene increases the bacterial membrane perme-
ability, thereby promoting the influx of antimicrobial substances. NS oil, 
TQ, carvacrol and p-cymene could be potential antibacterial agents. 
Phytochemicals, nutritionally vital constituents, PUFA as well as highly 
active volatile compounds such as p-cymene, TQ, α-thujene, carvacrol, 
β-pinene, limonene, methyl linoleate, sabinene, D-limonene, 4,5-epoxy- 
1-isopropyl-4- methyl-1-cyclohexene, and 4-terpineol found in NS 
could exert a medicinal value when processed and used correctly.
