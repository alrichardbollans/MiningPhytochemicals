INTRODUCTION 
Argyreia speciosa, is widely distributed plant species in 
India. It is commonly known as Elephant creeper, 
Samundar ka pat and Vryddhadaru. It is found 
throughout in India up to altitude of 500 m. It is great 
climber with big ovate-cordate leaves found growing 
native in north-eastern Himalaya, Dehradun, Konkan, 
Rajasthan, Mysore, and Bengal
1
. A. speciosa usually 
appreciated for its aesthetic merit. It is grown as an 
ornamental and decorative plant because its leaves are 
heart shape, green color and flowers are look like rose-
purple
2
. A. speciosa is a very valuable plant in the 
Ayurvedic system. In 'Rasayan' drug it has been used 
for the treatment of various neurological diseases. It has 
been also reported in indigenous medicine system that 
A. speciosa has given for chronic gonorrhea, ulcer, 
severe pain in urinary bladder (strangury), gleets, male 
sexual disorder. The plant leaves also possess the 
therapeutic activity against several skin diseases such 
as eczema, itching, ringworm and systemically in skin 
abscess. In addition, it also used as a rubefacient and 
local skin stimulant. In Rajasthan, some tribal’s used 
leaves to prevent the conceived in females

. 
Its root taste is bitter and having the multiple uses like 
as a brain tonic, diuretic, aphrodisiac, rheumatism. In 
other hands for persistent cold & cough, and in 
resulting fever, root paste with Grewia hirsute, 
Asparagus racemosus and Hemidesmus indicus 
prescribed for immediate relief. 
Its seven times root powder is macerated throughout 7 
days with tubers juice of Asparagus racemosus as 
nervine tonic. It promotes intellect, strengthens body

.      
A. speciosa seed exhibited potential psychedelic, 
antihypertensive and spasmolytic activity. Seed 
consisted of the various neuropharmacological active 
constituents which are the isomer of lysergic acid 
diethylamide (LSD) such as lysergacidamide and 
lysergacidethylamide. Due to this reason, the seed has 
been the misuse of psychomotor agitation, an 
orientation of disturbances and anxiety
6
. 
Due to the presence of numerous active 
phytoconstituents in A. speciosa, which used 
continuously since antiquity for the treatment of 
various diseases includes neurological, wound healing, 
aphrodisiac, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, 
antidiabetic, antiviral and many more.

PHYTOCONSTITUENTS 
A. speciosa contains various chemical constituents such 
as alkaloids (mainly ergoline), flavonoids, lipids, 
triterpenoids, saponin and steroids. The seeds mainly 
consisted of various fatty oils such as palmitic 
glycosides, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid. It 
also contains some amount of free amino acid like 
glycine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic and α-
aminobutyric acid
7
. In seed, serotonin (5HT) agonist 
like compound, LSD and its isomer also present which 
was accountable for its psychotropic property. Recently 
in the western hemisphere youngsters has been abused 
of this plant hence it’s also known as “legal highs” or 
“biogenic drugs”8. 
Principally roots contain the Tetradecanyl palmitate, 
stigma steryl p-hydroxy cinnamate, hexadecanyl p-
hydroxy cinnamate, quercetin and caffeic acid. Recently 
6-methoxy coumarin-7-O-α-D-glucopyranoside 
(coumarin glucoside) also isolated by the researchers
9
. 
The phytochemical investigation revealed the presence 
of kaempferol, quercetin, kaempferol  
3-O-L-rhamnopyranoside, 7, 8, 3′, 4′, 5′-penta hydroxyl 
flavone and 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside in A. speciosa 
leaves

. 
ETHNOBOTANICAL USES 
Dried root powder with an alcoholic drink (3:1) used by 
Lodhas for the cure of gonorrhea. In addition cow milk 
and root powder (1:2) used for the treatment of dysuria 
(painful urination). In the Western Ghats, Palliyar tribes 
given roots extract for gastrointestinal complications. 
Santals community practice leaf on skin abscess. 
Pongamia pinnata seed oil with green fresh leaf juice 
used by Oraons for controlling the obesity and anemia. 
A. speciosa extract also used by some tribes for 
syphilitic and other male sexual problems cases. It also 
exhibits the beneficial effect in smallpox. In Lakhimpur, 
the tuber paste is employed in gastric ulcer
11,12
. In 
Wayanad district of Kerala, Kurichiyas tribes used leaf, 
flower and root parts for treating the cough and 
rheumatoid arthritis
13
. Munda tribes practiced root 
powder, chilled milk and misri for the various 
ailments

PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES 
Wound healing activity 
Young leaves of A. speciosa are used for wound healing. 
An ointment, developed by adding ethanol, ethanol-
water, and water extracts were applied topically on mice 
skin for 14 days after induction of wound. The ethanolic 
and water extract of A. speciosa have shown significant 
wound healing activity in both incision and excision 
wound model. In another hand, water extract was found 
to be more potent. Results say that it significantly 
increased the rate of wound contraction, breaking 
strength, hydroxyl prolin content, and reduced 
epithelization point
15
. Treatment with leaves ethanolic 
extract ointment (15% w/w) of A. nervosa was showed 
significant wound healing effect in normal and diabetic 
rats
16
. 
Nootropic activity 
A. nervosa is commonly known as Vridha daraka. It’s 
commonly used in Ayurveda for neurological problems, 
on that behalf various researcher prooved nootropic and 
memory enhancing property of A. nervosa. Aqueous 
root extract at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg improved 
memory and successfully reverse memory loss induced 
by various agents such as diazepam and scopolamine. 
Along with this brain acetylcholine esterase activity also 
improved which is confirmed by significant nootropic 
activity
17
. Effect of hydroalcoholic extract of A. 
speciosa root (200 mg and 400 mg/kg), on learning and 
memory were also studied in mice using Radial arm 
maze and Morris water maze test. Piracetam used as the 
standard drug
18
. 
Aphrodisiac activity 
The ethnobotanical clues link A. nervosa having 
aphrodisiac property. The root, flower and to some 
degree, the leaf of the plant showed an increase in the 
mounting behavior of mice. The root alcohol extract 
(200 mg/kg) stimulated mounting behavior of male mice 
in a dose-dependent way. Moreover, the number of 
males was found to be higher between the pups fathered 
through the herbal drug-pretreated mice compared to 
those by the control mice
19
. Early it was clinically 
proved by Jayatilak that a preparation (Speman) of 
various herbal extracts like orchis mascula, Hygrophila 
spinosa, Lactuca scariola, Macuna pruriens, Parmelia 
parlata, A. speciosa, Tribulus terrestris and Leptadenia 
reticulate increased the secretory function of the male 
patient prostate. Along with this Speman also increases 
in the citric acid content, an activity of maltase with the 
increase in the degradation of glycogen in seminal 
plasma of administered patients. The drug Speman has 
the similar action on the prostatic function to 
androgen
20
. Drug “Fortege” is produced from Withania 
somnifera, Mucuna pruriens, A. speciosa, Leptadenia 
reticulata and Anacyclus pyrethrum is used for 
correcting prevalent male sexual disorders. Fortege has 
been examined to against Lanthanum induced infertility. 
Mice administered with Fortege showed the normal 
weight of seminal vesicle, fructose content, sperm 
number, and motility regained at 21st day of exposure
21
. 
 
Immunomodulatory effect 
Gokhle and colleagues proved the immunomodulatory 
activity of A. speciosa. In this study, they were used root 
(ethanolic) extract at dose of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg in 
mice. Results shows that extracts significantly 
potentiated the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction 
provoked both by sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and 
oxazolone
22
. 
Hepatoprotective activity 
Treatment with, A. nervosa methanolic extract (200 and 
400 mg/kg) of root significantly lower serum alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and 
alkaline phosphatase levels in CCl4-treated rats
23
. 
Suspensions of ethyl acetate and ethanol of A. speciosa 
(200 and 400 mg/kg) successfully prevented the 
alterations of serum biochemical parameters such as 
SGOT, SGPT, ALP, cholesterol, total bilirubin levels (p 
<  0.001) when compared to CCl4 treated animals. 
Histopathological examination showed that CCl4 treated 
group induces ballooning degeneration and centrilobular 
necrosis. While A. speciosa treated rat reverse all above 
mention pathological changes
24
. 
Analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity 
Bachhav and colleagues recently studied the analgesic 
and anti-inflammatory action of A. speciosa. The 
methanolic root extract at various dose levels 
significantly decreases the number of acetic acid-
induced writhing when compared to control animals. In 
another hand extract at 100 and 300 mg/kg dose 
attenuate the carrageenan-induced paw edema in the 
rat
25
. The fresh leaf ethanolic extract of A. nervosa (100, 
200 and 400 mg/kg) shows the promising results on 
acetic acid-induced writhing and hot plate model. The 
results obtained from 400 mg/kg were nearly similar to 
standard drug aspirin
26
. Lalan also proved the protective 
role of methanolic extract of A. speciosa against 
different pain models
27
. The whole aerial part from A. 
nervosa was studied for its anti-inflammatory activity. 
In carrageenan-induced paw edema, it was observed that 
the ethyl acetate extract and methanol extract produced 
significant decreases in the paw volume. The methanolic 
extract (300 mg/kg) showed potent anti-inflammatory 
activity comparable to ibuprofen. The author fails to 
explore the exact phytoconstituents for its activity
28
. 
Antipyretic activity 
Jeet claimed that whole aerial part extract from A. 
nervosa showed significant antipyretic activity (p < 
0.05) against yeast induced pyrexia in rats. According to 
author A. nervosa exhibited antipyretic activity probably 
by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the 
hypothalamus
29
. The hydro-alcoholic root extract of A. 
speciosa exhibited significant antipyretic activity (p < 
0.05), while acetone, chloroform and methanol fraction 
failed to produce the therapeutic effect
30
. 
Antidiabetic activity 
For evaluating the hypoglycemic activity, aerial parts of 
A. speciosa were used by the researcher. Alloxan treated 
rat showed the high level of glucose and lipid profile in 
the blood sample while group co-treated with extract 
 Jaiswal et al                                                                                                        Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2018; 8(5-s):41-46       
ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                               [44]                                                                             CODEN (USA): JDDTAO 
correct all the alteration significantly. As per the 
investigation, the antioxidant property is responsible for 
its antidiabetic effect
31
. 
Effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of A. speciosa 
on blood glucose and lipid profile was investigated in 
normoglycemic and Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced 
diabetic animals. In oral glucose and sucrose tolerance 
test, treatment with A. speciosa (100 and 200 mg/kg) 
and Glidenclamide (10 mg/kg) significantly improved 
the glucose and sucrose tolerance in normal animals. In 
addition, separate treatment for 15 days followed in 
significant reduction in serum glucose, 30.39% (100 
mg/kg) and 33.21% (200 mg/kg)
32
. 
In addition to the above findings researcher also proved 
the Ayurvedic claim of A. nervosa as a traditional 
antidiabetic agent. In this study, 18 rabbits were 
subjected to A. nervosa root powder in the form of 
suspension (0.56 g/kg) and metformin was used as 
standard drug. But at the end of the study result were not 
significant as metformin
33
. 
Anti-diarrheal agents 
Diarrhea is a common disease that is usually reported to 
the doctor for treatment. A. speciosa flower extract 
(ethanolic) was taken for evaluating the anti-diarrheal 
activity. The result showed that flower extract at a dose 
of (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg, orally) dose-dependently 
inhibit intestinal propulsion. In addition fecal matter and 
intestinal fluid also significantly reduced (9.97% - 
39.58%)
34
. 
Antimicrobial and antifungal activity 
A. nervosa has been recognized as a traditional remedy 
against several skin infections because of its powerful 
antimicrobial activity. Present study undertaken the 
following test organism: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, 
Streptococcus vulgarica, Salmonella typhe, Bacillus 
subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus pumilis and 
Aspergillus niger. The MIC value of methanolic and 
ethanolic extract was found maximum, against Bacillus 
megaterium at 484 µg/ml
35
. In addition, seed oil also 
possess the antifungal activity against Aspergillus 
flavus, Colletotrichum capsici, Cryptococcus 
neoformans, Alternaria solani, Helminthosporium sp., 
Colletotrichum dematium, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus 
sydowi and Fusarium oxysporum
36
. 
Shukla and colleagues isolate the hexadecanyl p-
hydroxycinnamate and scopoletin from the root of A. 
speciosa. Both isolated phytoconstituents were found to 
be effective against the Alternaria alternate
37
. 
Antiviral activity 
The fruit's extract of A. speciosa also evaluated for its 
antiviral activity. Author assesses the interferon-like 
antiviral activity against vaccinia virus in Chorio-
allantoic membranes cultures while the plant has failed 
to shows the protective action against Ranikhet virus
38
. 
The leaves extract of A. speciosa evaluated for anti-HIV 
activity. Three compounds, 1-hexacosanol, scopoletin 
and ethyl caffeate isolated from the ethanolic extract and 
tested on reverse transcriptase (RT) and HIV protease 
(PR) for anti-HIV effect. The result showed that all 
isolated compound significantly inhibit HIV RT and 
HIV PR by 78.71%, 43.35%, and 43.15%, 
respectively
39
. 
Nematicidal activity 
 A. speciosa aqueous (150 μg/ml) and alcoholic (75 
μg/ml) extract have shown the anti-filarial activity. Both 
extract significantly inhibit the spontaneous movements 
of the entire worm and a nerve-muscle preparation of 
Setaria cervi, characterized by the reduction in tone, 
amplitude, and rate of contractions
40
. 
Antiulcer activity 
Treatment with two fractions A & B (4.59 and 6.34 
mg/kg, p.o.) from A. nervosa leaves significantly 
increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and 
glutathione (GSH) antioxidant enzyme levels. Lipid 
peroxidation and nitrite levels were detected to be lower 
when compared to the control group. According to 
authors quercetin and kaemferol were active constituents 
of the plant for its antiulcer potential
41
. Jaiswal and 
colleagues recently described that leaf butanolic fraction 
of A. speciosa (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) showed 
gastroprotective activity. The fraction exhibited 
antiulcer activity in aspirin, ethanol, cold-restrain and 
pylorus ligation induced ulcers. The fraction dose-
dependently exhibited the protective effect in aspirin 
58.76%, ethanol 58.45%, cold-restrain 78.36% and 
pyloric ligation 69.04%, respectively. In addition, 
fraction also increased (p < 0.001) gastric mucus. It also 
significantly decreases the level of SOD, CAT and LPO 
concentration in treated rat
42
. 
Anticonvulsion activity 
As per documentation of Ayurveda the root of A. 
speciosa considered as useful in various nervous 
disorder. In this context, the author used the 
hydroalcoholic extract of the root in a different animal 
model of convulsion. The anticonvulsion effects of 10 
days treatment of hydroalcoholic extract (100, 200 and 
400 mg/kg) doses were evaluated using 
pentylenetetrazole and maximum-electroshock induced 
convulsion model. The results revealed that extract 
significantly inhibits the seizures and having the 
potential anticonvulsant effect
43,44
. 
Central nervous system depressant activity 
The hydroalcoholic root extract of A. speciosa (100, 200 
and 400 mg/kg) were tested for its anxiolytic and 
locomotion activity. Results showed that A. speciosa 
failed to increase in open arm entry and time spent in 
open arm.  However, it’s reduced some degree of 
locomotion activity
45
. 
Treatment of skin diseases 
Ethnobotanical survey finds that Garo tribal community 
living in Netrakona district, Bangladesh used whole 
plant paste for skin diseases and smallpox
46
. 
Anti obesity activity 
The anti-obesity activity of A. speciosa root extract was 
determined by evaluating the body weight, adipose 
tissue weight, serum leptin, triglycerides and total 
 Jaiswal et al                                                                                                        Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2018; 8(5-s):41-46       
ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                               [45]                                                                             CODEN (USA): JDDTAO 
cholesterol in the cafeteria-diet rat. Co-treatment with 
extract (500 mg/kg) for 42 days in rat feeding with 
cafeteria diet or atherogenic diet significantly reduced in 
body weight (p < 0.01), adipose tissue weight (p < 0.05), 
serum lipid content (p < 0.01) and triglycerides (p < 
0.01). In addition, A. speciosa also suppress fatty liver 
and pancreas lipase activity. The result clearly indicated 
that plant useful in obesity and metabolic syndrome
47
. 
The root ethanolic extract (500 mg/kg) of A. speciosa 
was assessed for its effects on rats fed with obesity diet. 
Results clearly suggest that root extract significantly 
lower triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL level and 
atherogenic index when compared to obesity rats. In 
addition, it also increases the HDL level in treated rats
48
. 
Anti-stress activity 
A. speciosa root extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 7 days 
given for evaluating the anti-stress activity.  Treatment 
with root extract causes marked decreases in immobility 
time and an increase in anoxic tolerance time in 
swimming endurance and anoxic tolerance test. A. 
speciosa also useful in inhibiting the pathological 
alteration in adrenal gland caused by cold restrained 
stress. Co-treatment with extract suppresses the humoral 
immune response to the antigen, immunized by sheep 
RBCs in mice. The author finds that extract possesses 
potent anti-stress activity and its immune-stimulating 
property was responsible for its activity
49
. 
Anticancer activity 
A. speciosa fresh leaves possess the potent gastric 
anticancer activity in Wistar rats. Cancer induced by N-
methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (100 µg/ml) for 20 
weeks. Quercetin isolated from ethanolic leaf extract 
and administered at dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg. 
The results indicated that the quercetin therapy dose-
dependently stimulates immunity activity in rats and 
have declared influence on survivin which is an 
attractive target for the therapy of gastric cancer
50
. Kaur 
and colleagues find that hydroalcoholic root extract 
showed decreased HCl-induced lung inflammation in a 
dose-dependent fashion. The dose of 100 mg/kg, almost 
entirely abolished the number of neutrophils in broncho-
alveolar lavage fluid. It also overcomes the gene 
expression of acute lung injury-linked pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1-β51. 
CONCLUSION 
Natural drugs and medications have been the significant 
role in the traditional system of medicines. In the 
present paper, we have made an effort to present the 
traditional uses, phytochemistry, ethnobotanical uses 
and pharmacological activities.  A. speciosa consisted of 
the various phytoconstituents mainly, psychotropic 
LSD, ergoline alkaloids and its derivatives, coumarin 
glycosides, kaempferol, quercetin. A. speciosa has 
varied pharmacological potential and was used since 
early times. It possesses the neuroprotective, wound 
healing, aphrodisiac, immunomodulatory, 
hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, antiviral and many other 
pharmacological activities. Furthermore, purification, 
isolation, and characterization of active secondary 
metabolites accountable for numerous pharmacological 
activities have not still been structurally interpreted, and 
expect much better planned and collaborative 
investigation.
