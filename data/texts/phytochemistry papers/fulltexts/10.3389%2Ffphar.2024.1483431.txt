Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SalviaeMiltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, SM) has been firstly recorded in Shen Nong’sHerbal Classic, and is frequently prescribed in conjunction with other herbs forthe management of osteoporosis. This systematic review aims tocomprehensively analyze the recent advances of SM on osteoporosis intraditional Chinese clinical uses and preclinical investigations. Literatureencompassing pertinent studies were systematically retrieved across multipledatabases, including the PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National KnowledgeInfrastructure, Chinese VIP Database, and Chinese Biomedical LiteratureDatabase. Original investigations spanning from February 2014 to March 2024,including traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) clinical trials and preclinical studies,were employed to analyze the effects and actions of SM on osteoporosis. Thirty-eight TCM clinical trials were identified to employ SM in combination with otherherbs for the management of primary and secondary osteoporosis. The overallefficacy was between 77% and 96.67%. Forty preclinical studies were identified toinvestigate the effects and actions of SM and/or its ingredients on osteoporosis.The anti-osteoporosis actions of this herb may be attributed to inhibitosteoclastogenesis/bone resorption and promote osteoblastogenesis/osteogenesis. The ethanol extracts and its ingredients (tanshinones) inhibitosteoclastogenesis/bone resorption by inhibiting the MAPK/NF-κB/NFATc1 signaling pathway and cathepsin K-induced collagen degradation.Both ethanol extracts (tanshinones) and water extracts (Sal B and tanshinol)contribute to osteoblastogenesis by promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesisvia activation of theWnt/β-catenin/VEGF and ERK/TAZ pathways, and eliminatingROS production targeting Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway. In conclusions, SMmay offera novel strategy for osteoporosis management. Well-designed clinical trials arestill needed to evaluate the actions of this herb and its ingredients on boneremodeling.KEYWORDSosteoporosis, Salvia Miltiorrhiza, preclinical investigations, TCM clinical trials,Osteoblast, OsteoclastOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYHua Li,Air Force Medical University, ChinaREVIEWED BYYang Ke,China Jiliang University, ChinaBo Shuai,Huazhong University of Science andTechnology, China*CORRESPONDENCEDongwei Zhang,dongwei1006@gmail.comShuofeng Zhang,shuofengzhang@sina.com†These authors have contributed equally tothis workRECEIVED 20 August 2024ACCEPTED 19 September 2024PUBLISHED 03 October 2024CITATIONWang L, Wang S, Dai X, Yue G, Yin J, Xu T, Shi H,Liu T, Jia Z, Brömme D, Zhang S and Zhang D(2024) Salvia miltiorrhiza in osteoporosis: areview of its phytochemistry, traditional clinicaluses and preclinical studies (2014–2024).Front.

Osteoporosisattacks both genders, yet exhibits a higher prevalence among womenaged 50 or older compared to their male counterparts. This sexdisparity primarily attributed to the abrupt cessation of estrogen,precipitating heightened bone turnover rates and subsequentlyaccelerating bone loss. According to the recent epidemiology,approximately 50% of women and 20% of men aged 50 or olderin the USA are projected to experience osteoporotic fracture duringtheir remaining lifetime. By 2040, the global incidence ofosteoporosis aged 50 or older is estimated to be doubled from158 million individuals in 2010 (Oden et al., 2015). By 2025, thecost of osteoporosis-related fractures in USA are projected toincrease to US$253 billion per year (Burge et al., 2007). Thisplaces a huge economic burden on the healthcare system ofthe society.Current FDA-approved drugs for osteoporosis can be dividedinto anti-resorptive inhibitors and osteoanabolic medications,including anti-resorptive bisphosphonates (Alendronate,Zoledronic acid), estrogen receptors modulators, estrogenreplacement, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand(RANKL) inhibitors (Denosumab) and osteoanabolic parathyroidhormone analogs (Teriparatide, Abaloparatide), sclerostin inhibitor(Romosozumab) (LeBoff et al., 2022). These drugs are documentedto effectively prevent bone loss but exhibit obvious side effects (Lim,2022; Handel et al., 2023; Ayers et al., 2023; Kendler et al., 2022;Kostenuik et al., 2023). For example, anti-resorptive drugs mayinhibit bone formation when bone resorption is limited (Ekeukuet al., 2021), owing to the coupling between osteoblasts andosteoclasts (Ekeuku et al., 2021). Due to the chronic characters ofthis disease, years or even decades of interventions may be needed.However, long-term use of anti-resorptive bisphosphonates anddenosumab may increase risk of atypical femoral fractures andosteonecrosis of the jaw (Ayers et al., 2023; Lim, 2022). Hence,there is an imperative to develop novel count-measures with low orno side effects for long-term management of osteoporosis.The dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SalviaeMiltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, SM), also named as “Danshen,”“Red sage,” was used as a traditional and folk Chinese medicine inmany Asian countries, especially in China and Japan, with marketsin America and Europe growing substantially (Kum et al., 2021). Ithas been historically and is currently either used alone or incombination with other herbs to treat skeletal diseases (Guoet al., 2014). In the previous investigation, we have reviewed theapplications of SM in the management of osteoporosis in vivo andin vitro from 2003 to 2013, revealing the potential of SM as a novelsource of anti-osteoporotic agents (Guo et al., 2014). Notably, aftersearching and researching for another decade, there is emergingevidence to support this potential. Therefore, we further analyze therecent progress in SM for the treatment of osteoporosis from 2014 to2024. For this purpose, we will firstly summarize the clinical uses ofSM to treat patients with osteoporosis in traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) trials. And then, we examine the recent advanceof the phytomedicine of this herb. Lastly, we comprehensivelyreview the actions and underlying mechanisms of SM on boneremodeling, including evidence derived from both in vitro and invivo studies (Figure 1).2 Traditional Definition of SalviaMiltiorrhiza on osteoporosisSM was highly valued and recorded in some Chinese herbalclassics such as Shen Nong’s Herbal Classic of the Materia Medica(Shennong Bencao Jing), Compendium of Materia Medica (BencaoGangmu) and Chinese Materia Medica (Zhonghua Bencao) (Suet al., 2015) and is noted for its efficacy in promoting bloodcirculation and resolving blood stasis, relieving pain and swelling(Kum et al., 2021).According to the TCM theories “kidney governing bone,”“spleen dominating muscles,” “liver storing blood,” “Qi andblood nourishing bone,” the main pathogenesis of osteoporosis isattributed to deficiencies in kidney, liver and spleen, which arelinked to “a “stagnation” and “lack of flow” of blood.” Thusly, theoccurrence of blood stasis and “lack of flow” contributes to the boneloss, muscle lose, joint failure and bone pain (Wu et al., 2024; Liuet al., 2024a). Therefore, promoting blood circulation to removeblood stasis is a strategy to treat osteoporosis. This highlights thepotential of SM to treat osteoporosis.3 MethodologyTo fully understand the actions of SM on osteoporosis, thefollowing databases were used for retrieving the information:PubMed (www.pubmed.com), CNKI (www.cnki.net), the Web ofScience (www.webofscience.com), www.cqvip.com, and www.wanfangdata.com (Figure 2). The following words and/or phrasesin various combinations were employed to retrieve the relevantreferences: S. Miltiorrhiza, osteoporosis, bone, osteoblasts,osteoclasts, clinical trials. Publications were initially screened bytitle and abstract.Approximately 157 papers were retrieved from January 2014 toJune 2024. Of these, 88 papers were excluded with the followingcriteria: duplication, only abstract, reviews and objective to treatother complications (Figure 2).4 Salvia Miltiorrhiza in TCM clinical trialsof osteoporosisAround 36 TCM clinical observations appeared during the pastdecades. Liu et al. (2014) evaluated 16 trials investigating the anti-osteoporotic efficacy with distinct Chinese herbal formulationsincluding SM. And then Guo et al. (2014) evaluated 20 trialsinvestigating the efficacy of SM in combination with other herbaland non-botanical components such as extracts from ants, shells,Chinese pangolin, and fossil bones, for the treatment of primary andsecondary osteoporosis. The combined 36 trials totally enrolled2066 patients, from which 25 trails targeted primary osteoporosis(including 13 trials of post-menopausal osteoporosis, 2 trials ofsenile osteoporosis), 8 trials treated secondary osteoporosis (majorFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1483431diabetes-induced osteoporosis), and 3 trials did not state explicitlythe osteoporosis type.In addition to the 36 TCM trails reported by Liu et al. (2014) andGuo et al. (2014), we have identified an additional 38 clinical studiesfocusing on primary and secondary osteoporosis that employed33 different Chinese herbal prescriptions including SM incombination with other botanicals and non-botanical components.Among these, only 3 studies used single SM or its ingredients(Tanshinone IIA) to treat osteoporotic patients (SupplementaryTable S1). These 38 clinical trials included 1,611 patients in total.Among which, 28 trials targeted primary osteoporosis, including post-menopausal, perimenopausal, and senile osteoporosis. For the rest,6 trials focused on the treatment of patients with diabetes-inducedosteoporosis, 4 trials did not indicate the type of osteoporosis(Supplementary Table S1). In addition, among the clinicalobservations, 35 investigations are single center randomizedcontrolled trial (RCT), while only 1 investigation is double-blindmulticenter randomized placebo-controlled trial. And2 investigations did not give the types of clinical trials.These trials determined anti-osteoporosis effects of this herb bytesting bone mineral density (BMD), bone metabolism markers, aswell as clinical symptoms such as osteoporotic pain, and life quality(Supplementary Table S1). Bone metabolism markers includeddegradation products of bone collagen molecules (C-telopeptideFIGURE 1A sketch of SM in osteoporosis on its Phytochemistry, Traditional Clinical Uses and Preclinical Studies.FIGURE 2Flow chart of literature analysis.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1483431cross-linked type 1 collagen [CTX-1]), enzymatic activitiesreflecting osteoclastic resorption, tartrate-resistant acidphosphatase [TRACP or TRAP]), type 1 collagen synthesis(procollagen type I N-propeptide [PINP]), osteoblast enzymes(bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BALP]), or bone matrixproteins (osteocalcin [OCN] and bone Gla protein [BGP])(Brown et al., 2022). High efficacy was predominantlycharacterized by a rise in BMD > 0.02 g/cm2 coupled withalleviation of osteoporotic pain and improvement of bonemetabolism markers (serum CTX-1, PINP, TRACP, Ca, P, andOCN). The collective efficacy (with marked and moderateimprovements) of trials involving patients with primaryosteoporosis ranged from 77% to 96.67%. And that forpatients with secondary osteoporosis, the efficacy ranged from83.3% to 93.3% (Supplementary Table S1).It should be noted that in the control groups the most frequentlyused western medicine were vitamin D and calcium supplements(Caltrate D, Calcium carbonate D3 calcitriol), bone resorptioninhibitors calcitonin (Salmon calcitonin) and bisphosphonates(Alendronate sodium, Zoledronic acid). While the novelmedicine including RANKL inhibitor (Denosumab), and selectiveestrogen receptor modulators (Raloxifene), as well as osteoanabolicparathyroid hormone analogs (Teriparatide, Abaloparatide), werenot included. The overall efficacy of trails used Chinese herbalprescriptions including SM or integrated these prescriptions withwestern medicine were better than those of western medicine only.(Supplementary Table S1).Most of the studies (20 trials) reported absences of adversereactions during the therapeutic interventions. Eight trials did notreport side effects. Ten trails reported slight adverse reactions,among which 1 patient had pain and red skin in infusion sitecaused by quick infusion (Yang et al., 2017), 15 cases had slightgastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, constipation,diarrhea (Chen et al., 2020; Yang, 2015; Dai, 2022; Han, 2016; Hong,2022; Wang, 2022), 2 cases had dizziness (Wang, 2022; Su et al.,2020), 4 cases had skin rash (Chen et al., 2020; Wang, 2022; Su et al.,2020), 1 case had nausea, vomiting and dizziness (Su et al., 2020),1 case decreased white blood cells and 1 case had abnormal liverfunction (Shuai, 2018). However, the similar or even higherincidence of side effects were observed in the control groupTABLE 1 Most frequently herbs used in combination with Salvia Miltiorrhizain osteoporosis clinical trials.Name of herb (Chinese pinyin name) FrequencyEpimedii Folium (Yinyanghuo) 23Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata (Shudi)/Rehmanniae Radix(Shengdi)20Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix (Niuxi) 19Astragali Radix (Huangqi) 18Dioscoreae Rhizoma (Shanyao) 17Drynariae Rhizoma (Gusuibu) 16Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui) 14Eucommiae Cortex (Duzhong) 14Glycyrrhizae Radix ET Rhizoma (Gancao) 12Corni Fructus (Shanzhuyu) 12FIGURE 3The chemical structures of Salvia Miltiorrhiza ingredients that are reported to mitigate osteoporosis in preclinical studies. 1.

Owing to the chroniccharacters of osteoporosis, years or even decades of preventivemeasures or therapy are needed (Foessl et al., 2023). However, allthe 38 clinical trials are characterized by a rather short treatmentduration from 2 weeks to 6 months. In addition, all the 38 clinicaltrials included a very small number of patients from 5 to 100 casesand were not placebo controlled. These make the evidence of efficacyof this herb is discounted. Besides, reducing fracture rate is one of themain aims of osteoporosis control (Kelm et al., 2023), while none ofthe 38 clinical trials addressed the effects of these TCM prescriptionsor single SM products on it. Furthermore, the outcomes for the trialsmostly included ambiguously description with the evaluatedparameters and biomarkers, thus making it difficult to overallcompare and validate the studies. Therefore, large randomizedclinical trials with defined and unified criteria for clinical efficacywill be necessary to better understanding of its action in the futureclinical studies.In these TCM clinical trials, numerous preparations of SMproducts or TCM prescriptions are used, including tablets/pill,capsules, granules, injectables, oral liquids (soup/decoction).These TCM prescriptions used in the osteoporotic trials mostlycontained 6 ~ 18 individual herbs or non-plant components. Therelative weight contributions of SM in these formulations rangedfrom 5% to 30%, as detailed in Supplementary Table S1. However,these available data failed to establish a discernible correlationbetween the relative weight of SM and the efficacy observed inthe trials. Owing to the substantial variability in herbal compositions(number of herbs used and their respective quantities), it is difficultto comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of this herb onosteoporosis.Li et al. (2022) collected 369 Chinese medicine prescriptions andfound that the top 3 frequently used herbs in the treatment ofpostmenopausal osteoporosis were Epimedium brevicornu Maxim.(Epimedii Folium), Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. (Rehmanniae RadixPraeparata) andAngelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Angelicae Sinensis Radix).Although SM did not emerge as top herbs among the most used ones inTCM osteoporosis clinical trials, a thorough search on PubMed using thekeywords “S. Miltiorrhiza” in conjunction with “bone” yielded123 pertinent articles. Other 10 most frequently utilized medicinalherb in the 38 studies that included SM are compiled in Table 1.5 Phytochemistry of Salvia MiltiorrhizaCurrently, more than 100 compounds were characterizedfrom Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, which can be divided into twomajor groups: water-soluble (hydrophilic) compounds andlipid-soluble (lipophilic) compounds. The water-soluble/hydrophilic compounds are mainly phenolic acids includingsalvianolic acid A/B/C, and rosmarinic acid. Lipid-soluble/lipophilic compounds are various nonpolar diterpenoidquinones including cryptotanshinone (CPT), tanshinoneI/IIA/IIB/V/VI, dihydrotanshinone I (DHT), isotanshinoneI/II (Guo et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2019; Lin and Chang, 2000;Zhao et al., 2022).Recent years, more and more diterpenoid quinones have beenidentified from this herb. Yin et al. (2021) isolated 13 novel diterpenoidquinones from the dried roots of SM, including R-(+)-salmiltiorin E, R-(+)-grandifolia D, salvianone ester A, which is reported to exhibit anti-tumor activities. Ying-Jie Ren and his team further isolated 25 novelditerpenoid quinones, including salviamilthone A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O, salvianolactone acid I, epi-danshenspiroketallactone F,danshinspiroketallactone, grandifolia G, which is demonstrated toexihibit anti-inflammatory effects (Ren et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2022).In addition, Jiang et al. (2023) isolated 6 tanshinones, including (+)-2-Cl-tanshindiol C, (−)-2-Cl-tanshindiol C, (+)-tanshinoic acid D,(−)-tanshinoic acid D, (−)-tanshinoic acid E, and (+)-tanshinoic acidE. All of these compounds were documented to exhibit antioxidantactivities.The water-soluble phenolic acids were documented to exihibit anti-coagulant, anti-thrombotic (Tang et al., 2021), anti-inflammatory (Tangand Zhao, 2024) and anti-tumor (Yang et al., 2024) activities. Thelipophilic diterpenoid tanshinones were reported to exhibit anti-oxidant(Jiang et al., 2023), anti-inflammatory (Tang and Zhao, 2024), anti-fibrotic (Zeng et al., 2024), anti-tumor (Yu et al., 2024), anti-osteoclastogenesis (Sudha et al., 2024) activities, and improvecognitive impairment (Liu et al., 2024b) and osteogenesis (Sudhaet al., 2024).

Ourgroup (Guo et al., 2014) had previously found that thesecountermeasures showed good anti-osteoporosis effects in differentosteoporotic animal models based on the studies from 2003–2013. Inthe current review, we summarize the studies from 2014 to 2024 whereSM itself and its active ingredients were used for osteoporosismanagement in different animals and cell models (Table 2).For the animal studies, ovariectomized (OVX) and naturallymenopaused (NM) mice or rats were used to mimic estrogendeficiency-induced osteoporosis. Prednisone, dexamethasone(Dex)-treated mice, rats or zebrafish were used to establishglucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporotic animal models.Streptozotocin (STZ) and high-fat diet-treated mice or rats wereused to make diabetic osteoporosis rodent models. To determine theeffects of SM on bone microstructure, dual-X-ray absorptiometry(DXA) was used in the quantification of BMD, and bone mineralcontent (BMC). Micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) was used toanalyze 3D and 2D bone microstructures, including BMD, BMC,bone volume over total volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness(Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), trabecular number(Tb.N), and structural model index (SMI).

Besides,bone histomorphometry and bone remodeling markers wereemployed as tools for evaluating both bone quality and turnover.Bone remodeling markers were primarily divided into boneresorption parameters (RANKL, OPG, RANKL/OPG, CTX,TRAP) and bone formation parameters (PINP, OCN, BALP,E2) (Table 2).In the present study, we firstly review experiments using SMaqueous extracts (SMA) and their constituents. The doses of SMAused ranged from 50 mg/kg/day to 5 g/kg/day, and the treatmentdurations were 12 ~14 weeks for the OVX-induced osteoporotic rats.Together, these studies indicated that SMA reversed estrogendeficiency-induced osteoporosis by OVX (Dong et al., 2018; Liuet al., 2018; Park et al., 2017). The underlying mechanisms wererelated to attenuate lipid accumulation and oxidative stress levels(Dong et al., 2018), favor OPG/wingless-related integration site(Wnt)/β-catenin-induced osteoblast differentiation, blockRANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation via down-regulatingthe expressions of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associatedfactor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFTAc1),cathepsin K and calcitonin (Dong et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018).Tanshinol, also recognized as Danshensu, a water-solublecomponent in S. Miltiorrhiza. Studies have documented thattanshinol at concentration of 16, 25 and 50 mg/kg/day andtherapeutic duration for 14 weeks attenuated GC-induced boneloss via promoting osteogenesis through the following pathways(Yang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017a; Lai et al.,2021): 1) Generally, osteogenesis is mainly mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while vascular endothelial growth factors(VEGFs) are key regulators in the cascade of angiogenesis andosteogenesis. The administration of GC to rat upregulatedthioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and kruppel-like factor(KLF15), which leads to an inhibition of the Wnt and VEGFpathways (Mo et al., 2021). Tanshinol was reported to promoteangiogenesis and osteogenesis via downregulation of the TXNIP/KLF15 signaling and upregulation of the Wnt and VEGF pathwaysto attenuate bone loss in mice exposed to GC (Yang et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2017a; Lai et al., 2021). 2) It is well-known that bothosteogenesis and bone marrow adipogenesis are regulated by theWnt pathway in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs)(Karthik and Guntur, 2021). And KLF15 stimulated by GC cantrigger the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor-γ (PPARγ), enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) andadipocyte fatty acid binding protein 2 (aP2), an adipocyte-specificgene), thusly contributing to adipogenesis. Moreover,KLF15 triggers expression of forkhead box O3 (FoxO3a), leadingto an inhibition of osteoblast differentiation via downregulation ofthe Wnt pathway (Yang et al., 2018). Interestingly, tanshinol wasshown to counteract GC-induced bone loss by inhibiting marrowadiposity through attenuation of the KLF15/PPARγ2/C/EBP/FoxO3a pathway and upregulation of the Wnt/β-cateninsignaling in rats (Yang et al., 2018).Recent interest has paid attentions to the contribution of freeradicals in bone remodeling (Leon-Reyes et al., 2023). During theFIGURE 4The actions and mechanisms of Salvia Miltiorrhiza on osteoporosis. Ethanol-soluble tanshinones inhibit RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factorkappa-B ligand) and M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) induced osteoclasts differentiation and bone resorption via blocking the ERK(extracellular signal regulated kinase)/AKT (protein kinase B)/NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B) pathway. Both ethanol-soluble tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) andwater-soluble tanshinol and Sal B (salvianolic acid B) promote osteogenesis by limiting ROS (reactive oxygen species) over-production via regulatingtheNox4 (NADPHoxidase 4)/Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)/HO-1 (hemeoxygenase 1) pathway, promoting osteogenesis and inhibitingadipogenesis via inhibiting the PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) pathway and activating theWnt (wingless-related integration site)/β-catenin and BMP (bone morphogenic protein)-2 pathways, as well as facilitating osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling via the Wnt/β-catenin/VEGF(vascular endothelial growth factor) pathway.Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1483431development of osteoporosis, over-production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) causes bone loss and microstructure disruption (Fanet al., 2023). Several lines of evidence revealed that GC exposureleads to the over-accumulation of intracellular ROS. Interestingly,both tanshinol (Yang et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2016a) and Sal B (Luoet al., 2016b) could reverse GC-induced inhibition of boneformation via inhibiting ROS over-production. Using Dex-treatedlarval zebrafish, both Sal B (2 µM for 6 days) and tanshinol(1–50 µM) were reported to promote osteogenesis by stimulatingthe expressions of osteoblast-specific genes (runt-relatedtranscription factor 2a [Runx2a], OCN, ALP, and osterix [Osx])via inhibiting ROS over-production (Luo et al., 2016b; Luo et al.,2016a). In addition, phosphorylation of p66Shc is an adapter proteinthat is recognized for its role in enhancing mitochondrial ROSproduction and promoting apoptosis (Haslem et al., 2022). Yangand colleagues revealed that tanshinol (16 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks)inhibited bone loss by attenuating oxidative stress via regulation ofthe ROS/p66Shc pathway in GC-induced osteoporotic rats (Yanget al., 2016).Using OVX-induced osteoporosis mice, tanshinol (5 mg/kg/daytreated for 12 weeks) was reported to attenuate bone loss by blockingnuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway (Han andWang, 2017). Inaddition, Sal B (40 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) was reported to promotebone formation in rats with tibia fracture (He and Shen, 2014)The following studies refer to SM ethanolic extracts (SME) andits lipophilic constituents. Lee et al. showed that SME(50–200 mg/kg) ameliorated trabecular bone loss both in OVXmice and naturally menopaused (NM) mice. Further investigationshowed that SME was effective in correcting aberrant levels ofRANKL, OCN, and BALP, and suppressing the gene expressionsof TRAF6, NFATc1 and cathepsin K to inhibit osteoclastdifferentiation and bone resorption (Lee et al., 2020). Tsai et al.found that 95% SME (the major components were 30% tanshinoneIIA, 5.8% cryptotanshinone, and 2.8% tanshinone I) attenuateddental alveolar bone resorption caused by lipopolysaccharide inrats, as evidenced by decreased numbers and percentage ofosteoclasts (Tsai et al., 2016).Lipophilic compounds, such as cryptotanshinone (Yang et al.,2022), tanshinone IIA (Wang et al., 2019a; Cheng et al., 2018) anddihydrotanshinone I (Ma et al., 2023), were shown to preventtrabecular bone loss in OVX rats. Oral administration ofcryptotanshinone (10 and 20 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) to OVXrats attenuated bone microarchitectural deterioration andprevented bone loss (Yang et al., 2022). Dihydrotanshinone I at adose of 10 mg/kg for a duration of 6 weeks reversed bone loss inOVX mice via inhibiting the NF-κB/extracellular signal regulatedkinase (ERK)/NFATc1 signaling pathways (Ma et al., 2023).Tanshinone IIA (Wang et al., 2019a; Cheng et al., 2018) atconcentration of 10–40 mg/kg/day for 2–12 weeks alleviatedOVX- or STZ-induced bone loss. The underlying mechanism wasrelated to inhibiting angiotensin-II expression (Zhang et al., 2020),attenuating osteoclastogenesis by inactivating the NF-κB/proteinkinase B (Akt) signaling pathways (Cheng et al., 2018), and up-regulating phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) (Wang et al.,2019a). Tanshinone IIA Sulfonic Sodium (T06) at 40 mg/kg/day for3 months reduced plasma CTX-1 by 20%, increased osteoblastnumbers and plasma PINP by ~28%, and increased BMD by35% in OVX-induced osteoporotic animals. And further studyshowed that T06 is a potent cathepsin K inhibitor, as itselectively inhibited collagen degradation induced by cathepsin K(Panwar et al., 2017).In summary, in vivo studies clearly reveal that SM and its activecomponents preserve bone quality in various osteoporotic rodentmodels. The aqueous extracts of SM and their constituents(tanshinol, Sal B) attenuate bone loss via promoting angiogenesisand inhibiting ROS over-generation. While ethanolic components(tanshinones) exhibit inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis andbone resorption.7 Salvia Miltiorrhiza and its constituentsin osteoporotic cell models7.1 Actions and mechanisms of SalviaMiltiorrhiza and its constituents onosteoclastogenesis and bone resorptionOsteoclasts are multinucleated cells that derived frommonocyte/macrophage-lineage cells, attaching tightly to bonesurfaces to secrete acids and proteases such as cathepsin K,finally leading to dissolution of bone mineral and degradation ofbone organic matrix. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor(M-CSF) and RANKL secreted by osteoblasts are pivotalcytokines critically involved in orchestrating osteoclastogenesis,including the intricate processes of osteoclast formation,differentiation, and resorption. Osteoclast precursors expressRANK, and differentiate into osteoclasts to perform boneresorption in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL secreted byosteoblasts (Foger-Samwald et al., 2022; Udagawa et al., 2021).Thus, inhibition of excessive osteoclast differentiation stands as apromising therapeutic strategy aimed at mitigating the onset andprogression of osteoporosis. Several in vitro studies investigated theeffects of SM and its ingredients on osteoclasts differentiation usingM-CSF and/or RANKL stimulated osteoclast precursors, includingbone marrow derived macrophages (BMMS), and RAW264.7 cells (Table 3).The lipophilic tanshinones, including cryptotanshinone (CPT)(Wang et al., 2019c; Yang et al., 2022), tanshinone IIA (Cheng et al.,2018), dihydrotanshinone I (Ma et al., 2023; Panwar et al., 2016), atconcentrations of 0.1–40 µM (as shown in Table 3), were reported toinhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. It is wellestablished that RANKL binds to its receptor RANK, thenrecruits TRAF6 and activates the downstream signaling of AKT,ERK, NF-κB, c-fos andNFATc1 to regulate osteoclast-specific genes,including TRAP, H+-ATPase, Atp6v0d2, Oscar, and cathepsin K,finally leading to osteoclastic bone resorption (Hodge et al., 2011).Cryptotanshinone at concentrations from 0.1 to 40 µM was reportedto dose-dependently decrease the TRAP-positive osteoclasts andreduce resorption pits in BMMs (Wang et al., 2019c). In anotherstudy, cryptotanshinone (0.1 and 10 µM) was demonstrated todecrease osteoclasts formation (Yang et al., 2022) throughdownregulating the expressions of osteoclastogenesis-relatedgenes such as TRAF6, c-Fos, NFATc1, cathepsin K via blockingthe ERK/NF-κB pathway (Wang et al., 2019c; Yang et al., 2022).Tanshinone IIA (at 1, 2, 5 μg/mL) was reported to dose-dependentlyattenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic boneFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1483431resorption through inhibiting the expressions of TRAP, cathepsin K,TRAF6, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, CTR, and NFATc1 viainhibiting the NF-κB/Akt/MAPK/c-fos signaling pathway (Chenget al., 2018). Dihydrotanshinone I (2 µM) was shown to attenuateRANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis targeting the ERK, NF-κB andNFATc1 signaling pathways (Ma et al., 2023). These findings puttanshinones into anti-RANKL agents with the functions ofattenuating bone resorption through the inhibition ofosteoclastogenesis.RANK-RANKL signaling also regulates cathepsin K expression.It is well known that Cathepsin K, the primary protease withinosteoclasts, plays an exclusive role in the degradation of type Icollagen (Col-I), which constitutes approximately 90% of theorganic bone matrix (Costa et al., 2011). Therefore, cathepsin Kemerges as a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention incombating osteoporosis. Dieter Brömme and his team successivelyproved the potential of lipophilic tanshinones as a potent cathepsinK inhibitor (Panwar et al., 2017; Panwar et al., 2018). They foundthat dihydrotanshinone I, a lipophilic abietane diterpenoids from S.Miltiorrhiza, inhibited cathepsin K induced insoluble collagen fiberdegradation (Panwar et al., 2016). They found that tanshinone IIASulfonic Sodium (T06) with an IC50 value of 2.7 ± 0.2 µM exhibitedan inhibition of cathepsin K activity by inhibiting cathepsin Kinduced insoluble collagen fiber degradation (Panwar et al.,2017). They further reported that SM herbal extracts and its12 kinds of tanshinones (T02, T05, T06, T07, T08, T09, T11,T12, T17, T20, T23 and T27 at 10 µM) exhibited inhibition ofcathepsin K mediated degradation of soluble collagen (Panwar et al.,2018). These findings put these tanshinones into anti-cathepsinK agents.In summary, in vitro evidence supports the notion thatlipophilic tanshinones extracts from SM, includingcryptotanshinone, tanshinone IIA, dihydrotanshinone I,inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast proliferation anddifferentiation targeting the MAPK/NF-κB/NFATc1 signalingpathway, thusly reducing osteoclastic bone resorption. Andsome of tanshinones are documented to be effective inhibitorsof cathepsin K, as they inhibited cathepsin K-induceddegradation of collagen in bone matrix. These findings help tounderstand the molecular mechanisms of anti-antiresorptive andanti-osteoporotic actions of SM, and put tanshinones into thesame mechanistic class as potential anti-RANKL and anti-cathepsin K agents.7.2 Actions and mechanisms of SalviaMiltiorrhiza and its constituents onosteogenesis/bone formationOsteoblasts, constituting 4%–6% of the total resident bone cells,derive from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Matureosteoblasts reside in close proximity to the bone surface, where theyorchestrate bone formation via synthesis and secretion of bonematrix proteins (Col-I) to guide mineralization of bonemeshwork. And upon completion of bone formation, most ofmature osteoblasts undergoes differentiation into osteocytes,which subsequently become encapsulated within the newlyformed bone matrix (Veis and O’Brien, 2023; Foger-Samwaldet al., 2022).To investigate the actions of SM and its ingredients onosteogenesis, various osteoblast precursors were used, includingMC3T3-E1 cells, MG cells, MG63 cells, pluripotent mesenchymalprecursor C2C12 cells, human periodontal ligament stem cells(hPDLSCs), BMSCs and human mesenchymal stem cells(hMSCs). The modeling approaches to osteoblasts include GC(Dex, PA), H2O2, simulated microgravity condition (SMG) andOVX-induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation andosteogenesis (Table 3). It should be noted that both water-solublesubstance [mainly Sal B, tanshinol (Danshensu)] and ethanol-soluble ingredients (mainly tanshinone IIA) exerting positiveeffects on osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis (Table 3).To evaluate the actions of SM on osteoblastic bone formation,the following makers were evaluated, including Osx, Runx2, Col-I,insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), OCN, osteopontin (OPN), andosteonectin. Of these, Osx and Runx2 are related to the developmentand differentiation of osteoblasts (Nakashima et al., 2002; Vimalrajet al., 2015). Col-I, OPN, OCN, and IGF-I are involved in theproduction of bone extracellular matrix. Col-I is the most importantfibrous collagen component, while OCN and OPN are major non-collagenous proteins in the bone matrix. OCN binds strongly to Col-I and hydroxyapatite, playing a crucial role in the mineralization ofextracellular matrix (Zhu et al., 2020), while IGF-1 released frombone matrix stimulates MSCs differentiation to osteoblasts (Xianet al., 2012), thereby promoting bone matrix synthesis (Crane andCao, 2014). It has been demonstrated that tanshinone IIA atconcentration from 1 to 5 µM (Liu et al., 2019), Sal B from0.1 to 20 µM (Xu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al.,2017), and tanshinol at concentrations from 1 to 5 µM (Yang et al.,2016; Zhang et al., 2017) increased genes expressions of Runx2, Osx,OCN, and OPN under different conditions.The bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt/β-catenin aretwo major signaling pathways responsible for osteoblastdifferentiation and osteogenesis by directly triggeringRunx2 expression (Gaur et al., 2005; Teufel and Hartmann,2019). One study demonstrated that pre-treatment withtanshinone IIA (1, 5 µM for 7 or 24 days) upregulated ALPexpression and calcium content in bone marrow-derived MSCs(BM-MSCs) by upregulating osteogenesis-related geneexpressions (Runx2, Col-I, OPN, OPG) targeting the BMP andWnt/β-catenin signaling pathways (Qian et al., 2015). Recently,growing attentions have been paid to an endosteal type Hcapillary, which couples angiogenesis with osteogenesis (Kusumbeet al., 2014). A crosstalk between the VEGF signaling and Wntpathway was proposed to investigate the links between vascular cellsand osteoblasts. Tanshinol was reported to attenuate the inhibitionof migration ability and tube formation in Dex-stimulated EA cells(human umbilical vein endothelial cells), thereby contributing tobone formation in MG cells by upregulating the expressions ofVEGFR2 and β-catenin (Lai et al., 2021). Further study found thattanshinol (1 µM) rescued Dex-induced inhibition of osteoblasticdifferentiation and bone formation in C2C12 cells and MC3T3-E1cells via regulating KLF15 expression (Yang et al., 2016). It is wellknown that administration of Dex upregulates KLF15 expression,thusly leading to an inhibition of the Wnt and VEGF pathways [64].Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1483431It is known that ERKs activation stimulates the phosphorylationand transcription of Runx2 (Ge et al., 2009). Sal B at 0.1–5 µMincreased ALP activity and upregulated the expressions ofosteogenesis-related genes (Runx2, Osx, OCN, OPN, BSP)through activating the ERK signaling pathway to promotemineralization of hMSCs (Xu et al., 2014). Furthermore, it is wellaccepted that ERK triggers the upregulation of TAZ (transcriptionalco-activator with PDZ-binding motif), and further stimulatesRunx2-mediated osteogenic differentiation (Byun et al., 2014),and inhibits PPARγ-induced adipogenesis (El Ouarrat et al.,2020). Sal B (0.1 or 1 µM) was found to reduce adipogenesis of3T3-L1 cells through downregulation of C/EBPβ and PPARγexpressions, and facilitate osteogenesis of MC3T3-E1 cellsthrough upregulation of Runx2 and OCN targeting TAZ viaactivating the MEK-ERK pathway (Wang et al., 2019b).hPDLSCs are postnatal stem cells that can be differentiated intoadipocytes, osteoblasts and odontoblasts. It is reported thattanshinone IIA (2.5 and 5 µM for 48 h) facilitated osteogenicdifferentiation of hPDLSC through upregulating the expressionsof Runx2, OCN, OPN, and ALP via activating the ERK1/2 signaling,while inhibited adipose differentiation of hPDLSC via down-regulating the PPARγ pathway (Liu et al., 2019).Excessive ROS production disturbs redox homeostasis, leadingto an inhibition of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, andan acceleration of osteoblast apoptosis, thereby jeopardizing boneformation (Leon-Reyes et al., 2023). SMA, Sal B and tanshinone IIAwere reported to exhibit an anti-oxidative effect to promoteosteogenesis (Dong et al., 2018; Li et al., 2015; Qiao et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2018). SMA at concentrations of 10 and 15 μg/mL wasreported to promote proliferation (cell viability) and differentiation(ALP activity) of pre-osteoblasts through reducing cellular ROSlevels in H2O2-treated MG63 cells (Dong et al., 2018). It is knownthat NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is one of major sources of ROSproduction (Kuroda et al., 2014). Tanshinone IIA at 1 µM wasreported to block Dex-induced osteoblasts apoptosis throughinhibiting Nox4-derived ROS production (Li et al., 2015). Inaddition, p66Shc is an adapter protein that is recognized for itsrole in enhancing mitochondrial ROS production and promotingapoptosis [68]. Tanshinol (1 µM) was reported to attenuate Dex-induced ROS over-production and osteoblasts apoptosis viaregulation of phosphorylation of p66Shc (Yang et al., 2016).Moreover, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) isone of the best characterized anti-oxidant cascades, functioning toregulate antioxidant response and protect osteoblasts from excessiveoxidative stress (Wang et al., 2023). After activation, Nrf2 istranslocated to the nucleus and binds to anti-oxidant responseelement (ARE), leading to activation of the antioxidant enzymeheme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and consequent upregulation ofRunx2 expression (Fan et al., 2023). Sal B at concentrations of25–55 μg/mL was reported to increase osteoblasts activity andupregulate expressions of Runx2, Osx, OPN, ALP, and Col-I undersimulated microgravity condition (SMG) through inhibiting oxidativestress via regulating the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 signaling pathway (Wanget al., 2018). In another study, Sal B was reported to ameliorate Dex-induced osteoblasts activity through upregulating bone formationrelated gene expressions (Col-I, IGF-I, OCN, Runx2 and Osx) viaregulating HO-1 expression (Qiao et al., 2019).Recently, the discovery of senescent cells’ causative role in age-related bone loss has garnered significant attention among scientistsand clinicians (Foger-Samwald et al., 2022). Indeed, BMSCs isolatedfrom OVX rat exhibited early signs of senescence (Wang et al.,2019a). Interestingly, tanshinone IIA at concentration of 20 µMcould suppress OVX-induced BMSCs senescence through up-regulating PHGDH (Wang et al., 2019a). It is known thatPHGDH is negatively associated cell senescence (Wu et al.,2023). One study reported that tanshinol (0–400 μg/mL) dose-dependently increased ALP activity, upregulated osteogenesis-related genes expressions of CollA1, Runx2, and OCN, whileinhibited apoptosis (increase of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax; decrease ofBax) in MC3T3-E1 cells (Han and Wang, 2017).Nitric oxide (NO) is produced in both osteoblasts andosteoclasts. And NO donors are proposed to promote boneformation and accelerate bone healing process, as well asdecrease osteoporotic fractures (Yousefzadeh et al., 2021). Indeed,NO donor sodium nitroprusside was able to increase the OPG/RANKL ratio in MSCs (Fan et al., 2004), thereby preventingosteoclastic bone resorption and promoting osteogenesis(Udagawa et al., 2021). In addition, NO donor nitroglycerinmitigated GC-induced bone loss in rats (Li et al., 2007). It isdocumented that NO bioavailability was decreased in the bonesof both OVX rats and postmenopausal women, which may be one ofthe primary cause underlying osteoporosis (Yousefzadeh et al.,2022). Intriguingly, Sal B (0.05, 2, 5 µM) and tanshinol (2 µM)were reported to promote NO secretion, thusly increase the OPG/RANKL ratio, leading to the osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs(OCN and ALP activity) (Zhang et al., 2017).Overall, both water-soluble substance (mainly Sal B andtanshinol) and ethanol-soluble tanshinone IIA were shown topromote osteoblastogenesis and osteogenesis. The underlyingmechanisms were related to inhibiting ROS over-production viaregulation of the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway, boosting the couplingbetween angiogenesis and osteogenesis via regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin/VEGF pathways, promoting osteogenesis via activation ofthe ERK/TAZ pathway, and inhibiting adipose differentiation ofosteoblast precursors via downregulation of the PPARγ pathway.8 ConclusionSM has been historically and is currently either used alone or incombination with other herbs or non-plant components to treatskeletal diseases. Currently, more than 100 compounds have beenidentified from this herb. Of these, tanshinone IIA,cryptotanshinone, Sal B and tanshinol exert osteoprotectiveeffects based on animal models and their corresponding cellmodels. The underlying mechanism may be involved in theinhibition of osteoclastogenesis/bone resorption by inhibiting theMAPK/NF-κB/NFATc1/cathepsin K signaling pathway, andpromotion of osteoblastogenesis by promoting osteogenesis andangiogenesis via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin/VEGF and ERK/TAZ pathways, and eliminating ROS production targeting Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway. However, recent interests only paid attentionsto the effects of SM on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Actions andmetabolisms of SM on osteocytes should be considered in the futureFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13Wang et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1483431investigations, as osteocyte is one of the major bone cells and playsan important role in bone metabolism (Figure 4).In the past 10 years, 38 clinical trials were documented that SM(single herbs or TCM prescriptions) could improve bone quality,attenuate osteoporosis pain and improve living quality in primaryand secondary osteoporosis patients. However, the evidence isdiscounted due to the poor designed clinical trials and thelimited duration of treatment. The criteria for efficacy were notclearly defined and unified, and biomarkers for the outcomes arediversified, thus making comparison and validation difficult.Therefore, randomized controlled trials with defined efficacy, along-term duration, a large size of sample patients are needed inthe future to evaluate the efficacy of SM on osteoporosis. In addition,human clinical trials validating the skeletal effects of tanshinones,Sal B and tanshinol are currently not available. For this purpose,rigorous clinical trials are warranted to substantiate the skeletalprotective efficacy of these bioactive ingredients.Combined with TCM theory, clinical usage and the results frompreclinical investigations, SMmay offer a new therapeutic avenue totreat osteoporosis and its complications. To this end, strongevidences from well-designed preclinical experiments and clinicaltrials are badly wanted, which will further enrich the applications ofSM to prevent the development of osteoporosis.Author contributionsLW: Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Projectadministration, Supervision, Validation, Writing–original draft,Writing–review and editing.
