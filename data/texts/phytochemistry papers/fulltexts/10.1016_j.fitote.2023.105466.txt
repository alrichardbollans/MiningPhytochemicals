This genus, comprising 23 accepted species, received less scientific attention compared to other genera of the Euphorbiaceae family. Seven Homa-lanthus species, such as H. giganteus, H. macradenius, H. nutans, H. nervosus, N. novoguineensis, H. populneus, and H. populifolius, have been reported to treat various health problems in traditional medicine. Only a few Homa-lanthus species have been investigated for their biological activities, including antibacterial, anti-HIV, anti- protozoal, estrogenic, and wound-healing activities. From a phytochemical point of view ent-atisane, ent-kaur-ane, and tigliane diterpenoids, triterpenoids, coumarins, and flavonol glycosides were found to be characteristic metabolites of the genus. The most promising compound is prostratin, isolated from H. nutans, with anti-HIV activity and the ability to eradicate the HIV reservoir in infected patients by mechanism of protein kinase C (PKC) agonist. This review provides information on traditional usage, phytochemistry, and biological activity of the genus Homalanthus with the aim to delineate future research directions.   1. Introduction Medicinal plants have been used in the traditional medicinal system since ancient times to treat a wide range of diseases and to promote health [1]. Recording the medicinal relevance of species from high biodiversity areas is crucial because some of these plants' natural habi-tats are rapidly disappearing as a result of anthropogenic activities [2]. It is generally estimated that there are approximately between 250,000 and 500,000 species of higher plants. Approximately 10,000 of different plants around the world have recorded medicinal use, and >90% of present therapeutic classes derive from natural product prototype [3]. In the last decades, efforts have been extended to look beyond the limited number of plants with a history of traditional use as medicines and to comprehensively screen plant species, considering nature as an unend-ing source of chemically diverse bioactive compounds for drug devel-opment [4–6]. Euphorbiaceae plant family, also known as the spurge family, is notably one of the most prominent flowering plant families with 227 accepted genera and over 8000 species [7]. Euphorbiaceae species are widely distributed, from Neotropical to Afrotropical, Indomalayan, Australasian, and Oceanian regions [8]. Species from this family exhibit a wide range of morphologies, including climbers, shrubs, and woody trees that often have latex in a variety of colors [9]. For decades, many regions of the world have traditionally used Euphorbiaceae species to treat various diseases such as fever, dysentery, skin problems (measles, ulcers, itches, and wound healing), gastric problems, urinary tract infections, malaria, and poisonous animal bites are among the possible usages. Although the latices from these plants are frequently described as an irritant, it was reported to be able to remove tumors and warts during the time of Hippocrates [10–15]. Many members of this family are economically important, including the rub-ber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), the candlenut (Aleurites moluccana), and tapioca (Manihot esculenta) [9]. One of the accepted genera that belong to Euphorbiaceae is Homa-lanthus (Table 1). Species from this genus have been used as medicinal plants to treat various diseases by many ethnicities throughout South-east Asia and Oceania (Table 2). This genus was first reported in 1790 by Noronha as Duania and mentioned as Omalanthus in 1824 by Adrien jussieu. The Omalanthus was later revised to Homalanthus to match its Greek word meaning [7,16]. From 23 accepted species in this genus (Table 1), only a total of seven species have been studied for their phytochemistry and biological activity (Table 3 and Table 4).

The current data shows no published review on the genus Homalanthus. Therefore, this study aims to summarize the data from current literature on the traditional use, phytochemistry, and biological activity of the genus Homalanthus. 2. Methodology A bibliographic search for this review was conducted by analyzing relevant databases. The searching was conducted in PubMed, Science-Direct, Web of Knowledge, SciFinder, JSTOR, and Google Scholar using the search terms “Homalanthus” and “Omalanthus” associated with “Medicinal Plants” and “Phytochemicals.” The literature in this review included theses, dissertations, and original research works in English that were available until November 10, 2022. Information on traditional uses, chemical compounds, and pharmacological activities from each literature were extracted and grouped into an appropriate table. Plant names and distribution were confirmed using an online database from the World Flora Online (http://www.worldfloraonline.org/) and KEW Royal Botanic Garden (https://powo.science.kew.org/). 3. Botanical description and geographical distribution The plants in the genus Homalanthus are usually trees or shrubs with smooth surface, and sometimes monoecious with milky latex. Leaves of this species are alternately arranged, long petiolate, sometimes with stipulate, peltate-shape leaves with entire to serrate margins and pinnate veins. The flower is usually bisexual with an inflorescence terminal and lobed fruit shape (2 or 3 lobes) with a thin crustaceous endocarp [18,19]. This genus primarily grows in wet and tropical regions, from Taiwan to Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia), Australia, and the Pacific (Table 1). Of the 23 species listed in this genus, seven are distributed in New Guinea (H. arfakiensis, H. longistylus, H. nervosus, H. novoguineensis, H. polyadenius, H. populifolius and H. remotus).

Based on the International Union for Conservation Nature (IUCN), 12 out of 23 species have been assessed. Only the species H. polyandrous is threatened with extinction (categorized as vulnerable) [20]. 4. Ethnomedicinal uses Homalanthus species have been used widely in many traditional medicine systems, mainly in the Pacific. The information regarding the traditional use of Homalanthus is gathered from ethnobotanical survey reports. Ethnobotanical survey is usually used to study relationships of indigenous communities with plants. Such surveys are usually con-ducted through interviews with key informants to gather information on the plants used for rituals, foods, medicine, economic or other purposes [21]. From a drug discovery perspective, the most valuable information are that related to the utilization of plants for treatment different dis-eases, which provide the starting point searching new effective mole-cules from plants [6]. Seven species have been reported for their medicinal use, along with two ethnomedicinal reports with unspecified species. Table 2 outlines the various ethnomedicinal uses of Homalanthus species together with their used plant parts. The traditional indication for each species were then grouped based on their therapeutic classification according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system, which the World Health Organization introduced. According to the ATC classification, dermatological conditions ac-count for 23% (6 of 26) of the ethnomedicinal use of the genus Homa-lanthus, followed by alimentary tract and musculoskeletal at 19% (5 of 26) (Table 2). The most cited species in the ethnomedicinal report is H. nutans. This plant is widely used by people in Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu as purgative, tonic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, analgesic agent, and it is also used to ease the birth process. However, H. nutans was also reportedly used as an abortifacient [27–29]. Homalanthus spe-cies were also known for their other uses besides medicine; H. nutans and H. populneus were reported as a fish poison, and an ethnobotanical investigation in 1970 documented that certain Homalanthus species are being used for magic practice [22,39]. As for the part used, the most common are leaves at 32%, bark and stem at 24%, roots at 12%, and sap/latex at 8%. Seeds, shoots, flowers, fruits, and succus have a single occurrence. The use of leaves as the primary component in the ethnomedicinal study is not new; many studies have shown similar results. Traditional healers use leaves most probably because it is the most abundant plant part and it is easy to conserve and preserve [40–42]. 5. Phytochemical constituent of the Homalanthus genus The study of the chemical composition of the genus Homalanthus is relatively limited. To date, only 4 (H. nutans, H. nervosus, H. acuminatus, and H. polyandrus) of the 23 known species have been studied from the phytochemical point of view. Isolated compounds belong to the group of diterpenoids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, and coumarins [16,17,43,44]. The isolated compounds are summarized in Table 3. 5.1. Diterpenoids Diterpenes occurring in plants of Euphorbiaceae can be character-ized by a great structural diversity, resulting from various macrocyclic and polycyclic skeletons, and oxygen-containing functionalities. Specific compounds of the family Euphorbiaceae (and Thymelaeaceae) are the macrocyclic diterpenes, and their cyclization products are called “lower terpenes,” which have chemotaxonomic relevance (e.g., casbane, jatro-phane, ingenane, daphnane, tigliane, lathyrane, myrsinane, segetane, etc.) [45,46]. Other group of diterpene constituents of the family is the nonspecific “higher diterpenes”; their skeletons, like labdane, clerodane, abietane, atisane, kaurane, and bayerane, occur widely in different plant families outside of Euphorbiaceae. Diterpenoids are the focus of natural product drug discovery due to the variety of their therapeutically rele-vant biological activities (e.g., antitumor, multidrug-resistance reversing, analgesic, and antiviral properties and anti-inflammatory activities) [47,48]. Some of these diterpenoids (e.g., prostratin, resin-iferatoxin, ingenol 3-angelate) serve as lead molecules for drug discovery. Five diterpenoids have been isolated and identified from the species of the genus Homalanthus [17,44] (Table 3). Four diterpenes were iso-lated from the chloroform-soluble extract prepared from the stem wood of H. acuminatus. Among the isolated diterpenoids, compounds 1 and 2 were based on ent-atisane and 3 and 4 on ent-kaurane skeleton (Fig. 1) [44]. Stereochemistry of ent-3S-hydroxy-atis-16(17)-en-1,4-dione (1) was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Multistep chro-matographic separation of the chloroform-soluble fraction of fresh stem wood of H. nutans afforded the isolation of prostratin (12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate) (5) that belongs to the tigliane skeletal type [17]. ent-3S-Hydroxy-atis-16(17)-en-1,4-dione (1) was reported from 5 Euphobiaceae species, Euphorbia characias, E. guyoniana, E. fischeriana, E. neriifolia, and Stillingia sanguinolenta [49–53]. It was tested for their inhibitory activity against breast cancer stem cells by the mammosphere formation assay in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and significant inhibitory activity was observed on mammosphere formation at a final concentration of 10 μM [51]. ent-16S,17-Dihydroxyatisane-3-one (2) was isolated from fifteen Euphorbia, one Sapium and one Triadica species [47,54]. Outside of Euphorbiaceae family it was reported from a Sola-num species [55]. Wei et al. reported the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of 2 with IC50 77.38 ± 8.52 μM [56]. Further, its anti-HIV ac-tivity was also tested and IC50 value of 6.6 ± 3.2 μg/mL was measured [57]. ent-3S,16s,17-Trihydroxykauran-2-one (3) has the most limited occurrence, it was found to date only in Euphorbia stracheyi, E. fischeriana, and E. yinshanica [52,58,59]. Compound 4 occurs in different genera of Euphorbiaceae including Euphorbia (13), Croton (1), Mallotus (1), Triadica (1), Sapium (2), Stillingia (1) species. This com-pound was isolated from two genera (Aloysia and Callicarpa) of Verbe-naceae species, too [60]. ent-16S,17-Dihydroxykauran-3-one (4) showed potentiating activity of nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells, with EC50 value of 19.7 μM, indicating its anti-neurodegenerative effect [61]. Prostratin (5) based on phorbol ester structure was first isolated and Table 3 Compounds isolated from Homalanthus species.

Later, it was identified in the Samoan medicinal plant H. nutans by using a bioassay-guided isolation process. In this experiment, XTT-tetrazolium assay was applied for anti-HIV-1 screening on the infected human lymphocyte cell lines which leads to the discovery of prostratin, the main anti-HIV compound of the plant [17]. The starting point of the study was the traditional knowledge of Samoan healers in Falealupo village who use the so called “mamala” tree to treat hepatitis. Prostratin (5) was later isolated from different Euphorbia species, E. fischeriana [63], E. cornigera [64], and E. grandicornis [65]. The stereochemistry of prostratin (5) was unam-biguously determined by using an X-ray diffraction analysis [66]. The concentrations of prostratin (5) in H. nutans were investigated by a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method. Four different populations from two Samoan islands were analyzed, and a significant variability of prostratin (5) content was observed. It was found that the stem tissue (ranging 0.2–52.6 μg/g) used by traditional healers contains a higher median concentration of pros-tratin (5) (3.5 μg/g) than root or leaf tissues (2.9 and 2.5 μg/g, respec-tively). The developed RP-HPLC method allows the selection of plants for agricultural cultivation aiming at the production of prostratin (5) for preclinical and clinical studies [67]. The first synthesis of prostratin was reported by Wender et al. in 2008. A semisynthesis was carried out starting from phorbol, which was readily available from renewable sources. This synthesis allowed the supply gram quantities of this therapeutically promising compound [68]. The chemical total synthesis of prostratin was elaborated by Tong et al. in 2018. The synthetic route includes 23 steps starting from cyclopentadiene [69]. 5.2. Triterpenoids Euphorbiaceae species usually are rich in triterpenes, especially the genus Euphorbia. Most of the triterpene that has been reported from Euphorbiaceae are oleanane, ursane, lupane, lanostane, friedelane, cycloartenol derivatives, and sterols [8]. The genus Homalanthus was barely investigated for triterpene constituents; only β-sitosterol (6) and an unidentified triterpene ketone with C30H48O composition were iso-lated from the stem of H. polyandrous [43] and β-stigmasterol (7) from the leaves of H. nervosus [16] (Fig. 1). 5.3. Phenolic compounds Currently, only one coumarin has been isolated from the genus Homalanthus. A simple coumarin, called scoparone (9), has been iso-lated and identified from the leaves of H. nervosus [16]. Nevertheless, only two flavonoid glucosides were reported from the genus Homalanthus. Hyperoside (10) and kaempferol-3-O-β-glucoside (11) were isolated from the methanolic and ethyl-acetate extracts from the leaves of H. nervosus (Fig. 1) [16]. Such flavonol glycosides are common compounds of Euphorbiaceae species [8]. 6. Biological activities Several biological assays have been carried out to support the eth-nomedicinal claims of Homalanthus species. The biological assays con-ducted were in vitro, together with three in vivo assays focusing on H. acuminatus, H. nervosus, H. nutans, H. novoguineensis, and H. populneus. Among the Homalanthus species, H. nutans and H. nervosus are the most explored ones. Table 4 summarizes the biological activities of the genus. 6.1. Antibacterial and anti-protozoal activity H. nutans and H. nervosus were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activity. The antibacterial effects of these species were mainly demonstrated in gram-positive bacteria. The ethanolic extract of the leaves of H. nutans was tested on bacterial pathogens associated with infected skin injuries, and this extract has been proven to inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 μg/mL [70]. In another study, ethanol extracts and their petroleum ether, dichloro-methane, and ethyl-acetate fractions prepared from leaves, stem, and root barks of H. nervosus were tested against 13  gram-positive and 12 gram-negative bacteria and against the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis by disk diffusion method [71]. The ethyl-acetate fraction of H. nervosus at 4 mg/disk had better activity than the positive control chloram-phenicol against Micrococcus roseus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Strepto-coccus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. The ethyl- acetate fraction of H. nervosus was found to have anti-protozoal activity against Trichomonas vaginalis; the activities of the leaf and root bark extracts were comparable to that of chloramphenicol [71]. The antibacterial activity from H. nervosus might be due to the ex-istence of sterol and flavonoids. It was reported that stigmasterol (6) isolated from the stem bark of Phyllanthus columnaris shows antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) through modulation of genes that lead the interference of bacterial growth [72]. Stigmasterol was found to downregulate several genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA (lysA and thrS), protein translation (tsf and tuf), RNA polymerase translation (rpoA and rpoB), and 43 genes that encoded the translation of ribosomal protein [72]. Hyperoside (10) and kaempferol 3-O-β-glucoside (11) can also contribute to the antibacterial activity by directly damaging the bacte-rial membrane [73]. However, antimicrobial mechanism of action of other compounds has not yet been elucidated. 6.2. Antiviral and HIV anti-latency activities The antiviral activity of prostratin (5) was discovered in an experi-ment performed on H. nutans, although this compound was first isolated from Pimelea prostrata (strathmore weed), a small endemic shrub from New Zealand [17,62]. The leaves of H. nutans in the form of water in-fusions have been used by the Samoan healers to treat back pain, abdominal swelling, and circumcision wounds, while the root infusion was used to suppress diarrhea and as an analgesic, and stem woods were prepared to treat yellow fever (Table 2). Starting from the traditional medicine knowledge, the extracts of H. nutans was investigated in vitro for antiviral activity by tetrazolium-based assay, and the inhibition of cytopathic effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) was detected. Prostratin (5) was isolated from the active extract by using a bioassay to monitor the HIV-1 cytopathic effect. This compound was found to be capable of preventing the reproduction of HIV-1 in lym-phocytic and monocytoid target cells at noncytotoxic concentrations (from 20.1 to >25 μM) and completely protecting susceptible cells from the lytic effects of HIV-1. Its cytoprotective concentration was ≥11 μM that essentially stopped virus reproduction in the studied cell lines [17]. Furthermore, it was interesting to test if prostratin (5) as a phorbol derivative is able to bind to protein kinase C (PKC) and either activate or inhibit it. In vitro experiments have showed that prostratin (5) binds to and activates protein kinase C in CEM-SS cells and causes additional biochemical reactions in C3H10T1/2 cells that are typical of phorbol esters [17]. Prostratin (5) is also capable of inhibiting de novo HIV infection most likely as it induces the downregulation of HIV receptors from the surface of target cells. This compound blocks HIV infection by downregulating the HIV cellular entry receptors CD4 and CXCR4 [74]. Prostratin (5) shares structural similarities with phorbol esters, which are known to promote tumor growth, but it was found to have no tumor- promoting properties [17]. Prostratin (5) was reported to be able to upregulate viral expression from latent provirus. Latently infected cells serve as a constant source of viral reactivation; hence, this discovery was significant. The persistence of latently infected cellular reservoirs constitutes the principal obstacle D.G. Wirasisya and J. Hohmann                                                                                                                                                                                                            Fitoterapia 166 (2023) 1054666to virus eradication with highly active anti-retroviral therapy. It was demonstrated that prostratin (5) effectively activate HIV-1 gene expression in the latently infected cells and activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and c-Jun N- terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways [75,76]. It was found by Brown et al. in 2005 that prostratin (5) induces the immediate–early, early, and late gene expression of Kaposi's sarcoma- associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in two lymphoma cell lines in vitro [77]. The extract of the tropical rainforest tree H. acuminatus was found to be active in the NCI AIDS-antiviral screen. A diterpene isolated from the extract, ent-3S-hydroxy-atis-16(17)-en-1,4-dione (1) was effective in the anti-HIV screen made by XTT-tetrazolium assay. It showed a maximum of 50% protection to HIV-infected cells at a concentration of 6 μg/mL, and it was noncytotoxic to uninfected control cells. However, in a higher concentration (12 μg/mL), cytotoxic effects increased in both control and HIV-infected cells; therefore this compound was not selected for further development [44]. A study by Sintya et al. aimed to analyze the effect of the extract of H. populneus on the expression of CD4 and CD8, both of which are Fig. 1. Compounds isolated from Homalanthus species.  D.G. Wirasisya and J. Hohmann                                                                                                                                                                                                            Fitoterapia 166 (2023) 1054667critical components of the body's HIV defense system. The expressions of Gp41 and Gp120 were analyzed by using talicytometry and an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, to examine the impact of the extract on HIV-1. It was revealed that the extract of H. populneus decreased the expression of CD4 receptor in both T-lymphoblast cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) (CEM). On the other hand, this extract increased the expression of PBMC CD8, and it was able to lower the proportion of the proteins gp41 and gp120 in CEM cultures [78]. 6.3. Other biological activities As part of a study, the wound-healing properties of plants used in traditional Samoan medicine, including H. nutans (mentioned as Oma-lanthus), was investigated in vitro by Frankova et al. on the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts. It was demonstrated that H. nutans extract significantly stimulates cell migration to the wound area [70]. The wound-healing mechanism is closely related to the acti-vation of NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB will trigger the release of pro- inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-13, that stimulate tissue repair [79]. Prostratin (5) has been reported to stimulate IKK-dependent phosphorylation leading to the activation of NF-κB [80]. A fascinating in vivo experiment investigating the regeneration of Xenopus laevis tadpole tail was done by Bishop et al. A significant percentage of amputated tadpoles were able to regenerate after 30 min of incubation in 10 μM of prostratin compared to vehicle control [81]. The only compound isolated from H. nutans was prostratin (5). However, its mechanism on cell migration has not yet been reported. Nevertheless, another tigliane diterpene (12-tigloyl-13-(2-methyl-butanoyl)-6,7-epoxy-4,5,9,12,13,20-hexahydroxy-1-tigliane-3-one) was reported to possess the ability to enhance keratinocyte migration and wound repopulation via PKC activation [82]. Bourdy et al. studied five plant species that were used in the tradi-tional medicine of Vanuatu (Melanesia) for the purposes relating to human reproduction. H. nutans was involved in this study because its fruits were applied traditionally as abortifacients. The infusions of the plant materials were assayed for estrogenic effects in vivo and oxytocic activities on isolated rat uterus in vitro. The extract of H. nutans prepared from fresh plant exhibited no estrogenic activity, but it was effective in the oxytocic test at a concentration of 2.5 × 10− 3 g/mL [83]. This study of oxytocic activity confirmed the ethnobotanical use of the plant as a powerful abortifacient. However, the compounds responsible for this activity were not identified yet. In the study by Nick et al., medicinal plants used in the traditional medicine of Papua New Guinea were analyzed for bioactivities. Seven-teen species were tested, including H. nervosus and H. novoguineensis, for PKC and tyrosine-specific protein kinase (PTK) of epidermal growth factor receptor activities in vitro. The methanolic extract of H. nervosus and H. novoguineensis were demonstrated to have high PKC inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 10 and 17 μg/mL, respectively. The pre-dominance of activity in the methanolic extracts could be due to the presence of ubiquitous, hydroxylated flavones, known as inhibitors of protein kinases. Accordingly, in this assay, the dichloromethane and petroleum ether extracts, which do not contain such compounds, were inactive. The methanolic extract of H. nervosus moderately inhibited PTK; 42% inhibition was shown at a concentration of 50 μg/mL [84]. Molluscicidal activities of H. nervosus and H. novoguineensis extracts were also tested, but both were inactive in this assay [84]. 6.4. Toxicity Three species (H. nutans, H. nervosus, and H. novoguineensis) have been reported for their moderate to high toxic activities. The methanol extracts from the leaves and flower of H. novoguineensis have been re-ported to be highly toxic against Artemia salina (LC50 6 μg/mL). Highly toxic properties of the methanolic and petroleum ether extracts of H. nervosus sap (LC50 44 μg/mL for both) in the brine shrimp test were observed [84]. The methanolic extract from the leaves of H. nutans had demonstrated moderate cytotoxicity against human dermal adult fibroblast cells with an IC50 value of 69.94 ± 2.08 μg/mL [70]. 7. Conclusion and future perspective This review highlights the knowledge about the traditional use, phytochemistry, and biological activities of Homalanthus species. The plants from this genus are mostly distributed in the Indomalayan, Aus-tralasian, and Oceanian region. According to some field investigation reports, species from the genus Homalanthus have been used tradition-ally to treat various ailments, including fever, skin disorders, malaria, toothache, heartburn, inflammation, respiratory disease, rheumatism, and many others. Some in vivo and in vitro pharmacological testings confirm the traditional use of the species of this genus. For instance, the stem of H. nutans is traditionally used to treat yellow fever, and pros-tratin (5) isolated from it has antiviral activity. Prostratin (5) has been shown to be a high potential as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of latent HIV infection. Despite the success story of finding the anti-HIV agent prostratin (5), the research of the genus Homalanthus seems did not highly escalate. Up to date, only 5 (21.7%) out of 23 accepted species of this genus are being investigated for their biological activities, and only four species (17.4%) are subjected to further phytochemical isolation. Diterpenoids, tri-terpenoids, flavonoids, and coumarins are listed as the secondary me-tabolites isolated from this genus. Currently, scientific literature on this genus remains scarce, thus leaving us with many opportunities to explore. Therefore, multidisciplinary studies are required to fully explore their potential in the search of promising compounds for drug discovery.
