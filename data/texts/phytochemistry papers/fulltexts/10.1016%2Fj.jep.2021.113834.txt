Areeful Haque, Ph.D.) 31 2   32 ABSTRACT 33 Ethnopharmacological relevance: The genus Gynura (Compositae) includes around 46 34 species and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Africa and Australia. Many 35 species within this genus are used in ethnomedicine to treat various disorders including skin 36 diseases, injuries, ulcers, wounds, burns, sores, scalds, as well as for the management of 37 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, constipation, rheumatism, bronchitis and 38 inflammation.  39 Aim of the review: This review is an attempt to provide scientific information regarding the 40 ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacological and toxicological profiles of Gynura 41 species along with the nomenclature, distribution, taxonomy and botanical features of the 42 genus. A critical analysis has been undertaken to understand the current and future 43 pharmaceutical prospects of the genus.  44 Materials & methods: Several electronic databases, including Google scholar, PubMed, Web 45 of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Semantic Scholar, MEDLINE and CNKI 46 Scholar, were explored as information sources. The Plant List Index was used for taxonomical 47 authentications. SciFinder and PubChem assisted in the verification of chemical structures. 48 Results: A large number of phytochemical analyses on Gynura have revealed the presence of 49 around 342 phytoconstituents including pyrrolizidine alkaloids, phenolic compounds, 50 chromanones, phenylpropanoid glycosides, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, steroids, 51 steroidal glycosides, cerebrosides, carotenoids, triterpenes, mono- and sesquiterpenes, 52 norisoprenoids, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and proteins. Several in vitro and in vivo 53 studies have demonstrated the pharmacological potential of Gynura species, including 54 antidiabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive and anticancer 55 activities. Although the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids within a few species has been 56 associated with possible hepatotoxicity, most of the common species have a good safety profile. 57 Conclusions: The importance of the genus Gynura both as a prominent contributor in 58 ethnomedicinal systems as well as a source of promising bioactive molecules is evident. Only 59 about one fourth of Gynura species have been studied so far. This review aims to provide some 60 scientific basis for future endeavors, including in-depth biological and chemical investigations 61 into already studied species as well as other lesser known species of Gynura. 62 3   63 Keywords: Gynura species; compositae; ethnomedicinal uses; phytochemistry; phenolic 64 compounds; pharmacological activity. 65  66  67  68 1. Introduction 69 The current number of vascular and flowering plants is estimated to be around 350,000 and 70 325,000, respectively. To date, only 25,791 of these plants (roughly less than 8%) have been 71 recorded for their medicinal uses (Antonelli et al., 2020). Medicinal plants are known to 72 produce a variety of bioactive phytochemicals that represent structurally-unique building 73 blocks for the development of new drugs (Feher and Schmidt, 2003; McChesney, 1996; 74 Swanson, 1998). This process of drug discovery commonly involves the biological screening 75 of plant extracts and phytochemicals using in vitro and animal models (Bindseil et al., 2001; 76 Kähkönen et al., 1999). The beneficial health effects of plants and their constituents are also 77 valuable when used as functional foods, including in the management of chronic conditions 78 (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and cancer) that also require a more diet-based treatment approach 79 (Hemler and Hu, 2019). 80 The genus Gynura (Compositae) comprises 46 species widely distributed from tropical 81 Africa to Australia and Southeast Asia, where the maximum diversity within this genus is found 82 (The Plant List, 2013; Vanijajiva, 2009). From a botanical point of view, the presence of 83 appendages to the style arms and of a basal tuber is a distinctive feature for this genus (Davies, 84 1980a). Phytochemical analyses of Gynura species have revealed the presence of diverse 85 constituents including alkaloids, phenolic compounds (especially quinic acid derivatives), 86 flavonoids, steroids, glycosides and terpenoids (Chandradevan et al., 2020; Do et al., 2020). 87 Several Gynura spp. are used for culinary purposes and/or employed in traditional medicine 88 for the treatment of migraine, fever, rashes, inflammation, rheumatism, herpes, constipation, 89 hypertension, hemostasis, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer (Do et al., 2020; Hong 90 et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2012; Xian and Juxian, 2002). The long historical use of consuming 91 Gynura species, combined with their oral safety and their broad variety of phytochemicals, 92 suggest that they are invaluable functional foods. This review aims to report on the 93 ethnomedicinal uses of Gynura spp., and on previous phytochemical and biological studies on 94 these species as a starting point for future work on this genus. 95 4   96 2. Methodology 97 An extensive literature search using the Google Scholar and PubMed databases was 98 conducted to retrieve the information relevant to this review. The main keywords for the search 99 were “Gynura”, “Gynura species”, “ethnopharmacology”, “ethnobotany”, “chemical 100 constituents”, “phytoconstituents”, “biological activity”, “pharmacological activity” and 101 “toxicology”. The Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Scopus, Semantic Scholar, 102 MEDLINE and CNKI Scholar were also used to collect the information. Our search yielded a 103 total of 115 Gynura-related articles published between 1977-2020 in peer-reviewed journals 104 worldwide. These articles were studied in detail in order to evaluate the authenticity and 105 relevance of their data during the compilation and synthesis of information. Wherever 106 appropriate, the data collected from the selected articles included the names of the authors, the 107 plant species reported, the plant part(s) studied, the phytochemicals isolated from the species, 108 the pharmacological investigations on each of the plant extract, the types of experiment 109 conducted, the dose/concentration at which the experiment was performed, and the information 110 related to toxicity studies. The retrieved information was categorized according to each 111 subheading and described in detail. The Plant List (version 1.1, 2013) was used to confirm the 112 identity of the Gynura species described in this review. All the chemical structures were 113 validated with SciFinder and PubChem and drawn using ChemDraw Ultra 15.0. 114  115 3. Taxonomy and Distribution 116 The Compositae (also known as Asteraceae) family represents the largest family of 117 angiosperms classified under the Magnoliopsida class and the Asterales order. The family 118 covers over 27,773 species distributed under nearly 1,765 genera (The Plant List, 2013). The 119 family name is derived from the composite arrangement of the flowers, which is a distinctive 120 trait of the plants of this family. Except for the arctic regions, the family is widely distributed 121 worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas (Panero and Crozier, 2012; Stevens, 122 2001). The genus Gynura Cass. is well known for both its culinary and medicinal uses. Around 123 193 species ranks have been listed under this genus, among which 46 are accepted plant names 124 (i.e., the scientific name that should be preferably employed to identify the species) and another 125 125 names are synonymous (i.e., recognized alternative names for plants for which accepted 126 names have already been established) with different accepted names within the genus (The 127 Plant List, 2013). Notably, accepted or synonymous plant names include the original author 128 5  name(s), original publication resource(s), and the International Plant Names Index (IPNI) 129 identifier (The Plant List, 2013). The genus mainly includes herbs and subshrubs along with a 130 few climbers and is distributed within the tropical regions of Asia, Africa and Australia. Plants 131 generally have vertical or decumbent stems and fibrous or tuberous roots. The simple and 132 alternately arranged leaves are characterized by an apiculate to acuminate apex, a cuneate, 133 truncate or obtusely rounded base, along with some entire, crenate, minutely denticulate to 134 coarsely dentate margins. Both the stems and leaves are of fleshy to succulent nature. The 135 inflorescences termed as capitula comprise of homogamous florets which are arranged on a 136 disc-like receptacle of flat, glabrous or epaleate shape along with eight to eighteen phyllaries. 137 The florets commonly appear as yellow to orange, red or purple in some species. Within each 138 flower, there are five stamens with linear anthers and two styles with branched, tapered style 139 arms (Davies, 1980b, 1979, 1978; Vanijajiva, 2009). The complete taxonomical classification 140 of the genus is provided given below (Classification for Kingdom Plantae Down to Genus 141 Gynura Cass., 2013); 142  Kingdom: Plantae (Plants) 143  Subkingdom: Tracheobionta (Vascular plants) 144  Superdivision: Spermatophyta (Seed plants) 145  Division: Magnoliophyta (Flowering plants) 146  Class: Magnoliopsida (Dicotyledons) 147  Subclass: Asteridae 148  Order: Asterales 149  Family: Compositae/Asteraceae  150  Genus: Gynura Cass. 151  152 4. Ethnomedicinal uses 153 Several Gynura spp. have a long history of use in traditional ethnomedicine to treat a range 154 of ailments in Africa, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Nepal, Bhutan, Japan, China, Taiwan, 155 India, Bangladesh, and countries in the Southeast Asian regions including Indonesia, Malaysia, 156 Philippines, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. The individual ethnomedicinal uses 157 of the main Gynura spp. are summarised in Table 1.  158  159 6  5. Chemical constituents 160 Gynura species are rich in pyrrolizidine alkaloids as well as phenolic and flavonoid 161 constituents. A wide array of phenolic and flavonoid glycosides has also been isolated from 162 the genus. Steroids, steroidal glycosides, carotenoids, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, 163 monoterpenes, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, peptides, and several proteins have also been 164 reported from Gynura. A comprehensive overview of the bioactive secondary metabolites 165 isolated from Gynura spp. along with their sources and biological properties are discussed 166 below and summarised in Table 2 and Figure 1-16.  167  168 5.1. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids 169 Several Gynura spp. contain some ester-type pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which cause 170 hepatotoxicity in vivo. The structure of these alkaloids features necine base, with two pentacylic 171 rings fused together with a tertiary nitrogen atom as bridgehead (Fioeoen, 2000). Depending 172 on the presence of unsaturation within the necine base and the oxidation state of the base, PAs 173 are classified as the retronecine-type, otonecine-type and platynecine-type. Both the 174 retronecine- and otonecine-type PAs contains a 1,2-double bond in the necine base and are 175 hepatotoxic. The otonecine-type PAs differ from the retronecine-type by the presence of 176 oxidation in the bridging carbon of the ring resulting in an octacyclic ring instead of fused 177 pentacylic moieties. The platynecine-type PAs consist of a saturated necine base and are 178 generally non-toxic or less toxic (Zhu et al., 2016). A total of twenty-six retronecine-type (1-179 26), one otonecine-type (27) and three platynecine-type PAs (28-30), have been isolated from 180 Gynura spp. (Figure 1). Senecionine (6) is the most abundant PA among different species 181 including G. bicolor (Chen et al., 2017), G. divaricata (Chen et al., 2017), G. elliptica (Lin et 182 al., 2000), G. japonica (Fang et al., 2014), G. pseudochina (Windono et al., 2012) and G. 183 segetum (Liang and Roeder, 1984; Qi et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009). The whole plant of G. 184 segetum contains a maximum of sixteen PAs (1-4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 22-26, 28). Eleven PAs 185 (6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18-22) were isolated from the roots of G. japonica (Fang et al., 2014; Qi et 186 al., 2009). 187  188 5.2. Phenolic compounds  189 Eight benzoic acid derivatives (31-38), four cinnamic acid derivatives (39-42), nine other 190 phenolic constituents (43-51) (Figure 2) as well as twenty quinic acid derivatives (52-71) have 191 been isolated from Gynura spp. Among the quinic acid derivatives, there are four mono-192 7  substituted coumaroylquinic acids (52-55) and three mono-substituted feruloylquinic acid 193 moieties (69-71). Thirteen caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid) derivatives (56-68) reported 194 from the genus include mono- and di-substituted caffeoylquinic acid moieties as well as methyl 195 or ethyl esters of those acids (Figure 3). With twenty-nine compounds (31-33, 35, 37-41. 47. 196 50, 51, 52-64, 67, 69-71), G. bicolor has the highest number of phenolic constituents (Chao et 197 al, 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Teoh et al., 2016). Chlorogenic acid (56) is the most abundant 198 phenolic compound distributed among the species G. bicolor (Chao et al., 2015; Chen et al., 199 2015; Teoh et al., 2016), G. divaricata (Chen et al., 2015), G. medica (Tan et al., 2013), G. 200 nepalensis (Yu et al., 2016), G. procumbens (Kaewseejan and Siriamornpun 2015) and G. 201 pseudochina (Sukadeetad et al., 2018). 202 Four compounds (72-75), isolated from the underground parts of G. japonica (Lin et al, 2003) 203 and G. elliptica (Lin et al., 2000), bear the basic chromanone moiety in their structure (Figure 204 4). Ten phenylpropanoids glycosides (76-84) have also been reported from the aerial parts of 205 G. cusimbua (Ma et al., 2019) (Figure 5). Multiple phenolic constituents including a caffeoyl 206 group constitute the aglycone parts of these glycosides. 207  208 5.3. Flavonoids 209 Phytochemical investigations of Gynura spp. have revealed the presence of four flavones 210 (86-89), two flavanones (90-91), two flavan-3-ols (92-93) and five anthocyanidins (94-98) 211 (Figure 6). Fourteen flavonoid glycosides (99-112) have also been reported (Figure 7). The 212 aglycone parts of these glycosides include eleven flavones (99-109) bonded to one or two 213 monosaccharides or one disaccharide through O-glycosidic bonds, one flavone connected to a 214 glucose moiety through a C-glycosidic linkage (110) as well as one flavanone (111) and one 215 anthocyanidin (112) moieties with O-glycosidic linkages. Eleven flavonoids (86-90, 93-98) 216 and eight flavonoid glycosides (99-102, 106, 107, 109, 112) have been isolated from G. bicolor 217 (Chao et al, 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Teoh et al., 2016). Rutin (107) is distributed among the 218 highest number of species including G. bicolor (Chao et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Teoh et 219 al., 2016), G. divaricata (Chen et al., 2009a; Chen et al., 2015; Wan et al., 2011b), G. calciphila 220 (Anurukvorakun, 2013), G. formosana (Hou et al., 2005), G. medica (Liu et al., 2010; Tan et 221 al., 2013), G. procumbens (Akowuah et al., 2002; Kaewseejan and Siriamornpun 2015), G. 222 pseudochina (Siriwatanametanon and Heinrich, 2011; Sukadeetad et al., 2018) and G. segetum 223 (Yuandani and Husain 2017). 224  225 8  5.4. Steroids 226 Twenty steroidal aglycones (113-132) (Figure 8) and seven steroidal glycosides (133-139) 227 (Figure 9) have been reported from Gynura species. The most abundant steroids, β-sitosterol 228 and β-stigmasterol, are present in G. japonica (Lin et al., 2003; Takahira et al., 1977), G. 229 segetum (Zhu et al., 2013), G. procumbens (Hu et al., 2019; Rahman and Asad, 2013; Sadikun 230 et al., 1996) and G. pseudochina (Gultom, 2016). All steroidal aglycones and glycosides, 231 except for one (123), have been isolated from the underground parts viz. rhizomes and roots of 232 G. japonica (Lin et al., 2003; Takahira et al., 1977). 233  234 5.5. Cerebrosides  235 Cerebrosides are condensation products of long chain fatty hydroxy amines and fatty acids. 236 Four cerebrosides (140-144) have been reported from the rhizomes of G. japonica (Lin et al., 237 2004) and one (144) from the aerial parts of G. japonica (Zhu et al., 2013). They all contained 238 α-hydroxy amines connected to α-hydroxy acids by amide linkage. A glycosidic derivative 239 (145) has also been isolated from the aerial parts of G. divaricata (Chen et al., 2009b) (Figure 240 10).  241  242 5.6. Terpenoids 243 Two triterpenes, named lutein (146) and zeaxanthin (147), have been isolated from the 244 leaves of G. bicolor [30,47] (Figure 11). Eleven triterpenes (148-158) have been isolated from 245 the aerial parts of G. segetum and the rhizomes of G. japonica (Lin et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2003) 246 (Figure 12). Several mono- and sesquiterpenes, of both non-volatile and volatile nature, have 247 also been reported from Gynura species. Eight non-volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes (159-248 166) have been identified in the aerial parts of G. bicolor (Chen et al., 2012b) and G. 249 procumbens (Zhang et al., 2014) (Figure 13). Eighty-nine volatile constituents (167-255) from 250 various Gynura spp. (Figure 14) have been detected using gas chromatography-mass 251 spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) 252 techniques (Chen et al., 2012a; Jiangseubchatveera et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2003; Lin et al., 253 2000; Rana and Blazquez, 2007; Shimizu et al., 2009). Four megastigmane-type 254 norisoprenoids (256-259) have been isolated from the aerial parts of G. bicolor (Chen et al., 255 2012b) (Figure 15). 256  257 9  5.7. Carbohydrates  258 Five fructo-oligosaccharides (260-264) have been reported from the aerial parts of G. 259 divaricata (Chou et al., 2012) (Figure 16). Besides, nine polysaccharides (265-273) of variable 260 monomers have been isolated from G. divaricata (Liu et al., 2011), G. medica (Li et al., 2016) 261 and G. procumbens (Li et al., 2017).  262  263 5.8. Peptides and proteins 264 A large number of biologically-active peptides and proteins (274-342) have been isolated 265 from the leaves of G. procumbens (Hew et al., 2011). One has also been reported from the 266 leaves of G. pseudochina (Chaichana et al., 2019). 267  268 6. Pharmacological properties 269 Pharmacological investigations on crude extracts and phytochemicals isolated from 270 different parts of Gynura species have revealed diverse pharmacological properties including, 271 antidiabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cardioprotective and anticancer 272 activity. Since G. japonica and G. segetum are synonymous, with the former being the accepted 273 name (The Plant List, 2013), their pharmacological activities have been described under the 274 title of G. japonica. The key pharmacological properties of extracts and phytochemicals of 275 major Gynura species are summarized in Table 3. 276  277 6.1. Antidiabetic/hypoglycemic activity 278 6.1.1. G. bicolor 279 The aqueous extract of G. bicolor, when incorporated into the diet of male BALB/cA mice 280 at concentrations of 0.5% and 1%, induced a significant reduction in the plasma glucose level 281 and increase in the insulin level. It also reduced the plasma protein C and anti-thrombin III 282 levels as well as increased the plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-I and fibrinogen levels. 283 It decreased the plasma triglycerides level and reduced the oxidative and inflammatory stress 284 commonly associated with diabetes. The extract also enhanced the glutathione concentration, 285 activated glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase, and reduced the 286 production of reactive oxygen species in the heart and kidneys. It diminished the release of pro-287 inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 288 the mRNA expression of inflammatory precursors including p38 and nuclear factor kappa (NF-289 κ) B (Pai et al., 2019). The aforementioned information suggests that the antidiabetic activity 290 10  of G. bicolor is mediated in an insulin-dependent manner and future investigations are required 291 in order to ascertain the efficacy of this species in insulin-resistant in vivo systems.  292  293 6.1.2. G. divaricata 294 The antidiabetic properties of the aqueous extract of G. divaricata leaves, and its different 295 fractions, were investigated in vitro. Potent hypoglycemic activity was reported for the aqueous 296 extract as well as the ethyl acetate fraction. This was attributed to their capacity to inhibit α-297 amylase and α-glucosidase in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations required for 50% 298 inhibition of α-amylase (IC50 value) were 1.36 ± 0.11 and 0.0475 ± 0.0036 mg/mL for the 299 aqueous extract and the standard drug acarbose, respectively. In the case of α-glucosidase, the 300 IC50 values were calculated as 2.17 ± 0.09 and 0.27 ± 0.03 mg/mL for the aqueous extract and 301 acarbose, respectively (Wu et al., 2011). A study in mice further demonstrated the 302 hypoglycemic effect of G. divaricata. The latter reduced the fasting plasma glucose level, 303 enhanced glutathione peroxidase and total superoxide dismutase activity, diminished plasma 304 triglycerides and cholesterol levels, and improved glycogen accumulation in the liver. At the 305 cellular level, the extract enhanced the genetic and protein expression of protein kinase B 306 (PKB, also known as AKT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and 3-phosphoinositide-307 dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). This study also showed an amelioration of insulin level in 308 diabetic mice (Xu et al., 2015). The aqueous extract of G. divaricata (at doses of 5 and 10 309 mg/mL) also improved dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells by enhancing 310 glucose uptake and metabolism. The extract minimized fat accumulation in the liver and 311 pancreatic islets, leading to a reduced total body weight as opposed to the net increase in body 312 weight of diabetic mice treated with pioglitazone and a high-fat diet (Li et al., 2018). 313 Phytochemical analysis of G. divaricata showed the presence of polysaccharides capable of 314 minimizing intestinal disaccharidases activities as well as of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives 315 with prominent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (Chaichana et al., 2019; Hew et al., 2011). In 316 streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, disaccharidase enzymes like maltase, sucrase and lactase 317 have an enhanced level of activity. A polysaccharide-containing preparation from G. divaricata 318 demonstrated a noteworthy decrease in maltase and sucrase activity in all three segments of the 319 small intestine. Lactase activity was attenuated in the duodenum only. This polysaccharide 320 preparation reduced fasting plasma glucose concentration and improved the plasma insulin 321 level to a significant extent (Deng et al., 2011). 3,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (61), methyl 3,4-322 dicaffeoylquinate (62), 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (66) and methyl 4,5-dicaffeoylquinate (67) 323 showed prominent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, as evident from their IC50 values of 187.2 324 11  ± 12.9, 12.23 ± 0.64, 130.8 ± 10.3 and 13.08 ± 0.86 µM, respectively, when compared to 325 acarbose (IC50 value 867.4 ± 76.2 µM). 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (63) and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic 326 acid (66) as well as the standard seramin exerted comparable inhibitory activities (41.6, 58.2 327 and 44.6%, respectively) against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a down-regulator 328 of insulin receptor signal transduction (Chen et al., 2014). Although the antidiabetic activity of 329 both G. divaricata extract and its individual constituents have been thoroughly characterized 330 through enzymatic interactions, in vivo reciprocation of the data is necessary along with 331 adequate structure-activity relationship analysis in order to identify potential antidiabetic lead 332 molecules.    333  334 6.1.3. G. medica 335 Multiple studies have demonstrated that G. medica reduced the plasma glucose level and 336 improved glucose tolerance in adrenaline-glucose-induced diabetic mice. This effect was 337 attributed to an enhanced secretion of insulin from the islet cells and a sustained high plasma 338 insulin level (Ji et al., 2009; Liu et al 2005; Zheng-dong and Wen-shu, 2008). Whilst these 339 results are interesting, further studies using insulin resistant models should be carried out in in 340 order to ascertain the complete antidiabetic potential of this species. Phytochemical 341 investigation followed by in vitro antidiabetic assay revealed prominent activity for several 342 constituents isolated from the ethanol extract of this plant. Compared to the standard acarbose 343 (IC50 value 0.99 ± 0.02 mg/mL), methyl 3,5-dicaffeoylquinate (64), quercetin (88), kaempferol-344 3-O-β-D-glucoside (99), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (101) and rutin (107) demonstrated 345 significant α-glucosidase inhibitory activity in yeasts (IC50 values of 0.53 ± 0.02, 1.67 ± 0.05, 346 1.46 0.03, 0.38 ± 0.03 and 0.10 ± 0.01 mg/mL, respectively) (Tan et al., 2013).  347  348 6.1.4. G. procumbens 349 G. procumbens is gaining popularity as the “Insulin plant” or “Diabetes plant” as it has been 350 demonstrated to be effective in limiting the requirement of insulin in diabetic patients. Its 351 antidiabetic activity follows a biguanide (metformin)-like mechanism of action. This species 352 significantly lowers the plasma glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides levels in streptozotocin-353 induced diabetic rats. At doses of 150 mg/kg body weight, the ethanol extract showed a 354 maximum reduction of the plasma glucose concentration (15.8%) 2h after a glucose load 355 (Zhang and Tan, 2000). The aqueous extract, at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight, 356 significantly lowered the fasting plasma glucose level in rats. G. procumbens extract enhanced 357 the uptake of glucose by abdominal muscle cells, thus improving the plasma glucose regulation. 358 12  In the absence of insulin, the aqueous extract enhanced the glucose uptake (3.77 ± 0.43 mg per 359 g tissue weight) compared to the control group (1.76 ± 0.35 mg per g tissue weight). A similar, 360 yet more prominent effect, was observed with concomitant administration of insulin (100 361 mU/mL) (glucose uptake of 5.77 ± 0.32 mg per g tissue weight) (Hassan et al., 2010). The 362 aqueous extract enhanced the translocation of the glucose transporter type 4 to the plasma 363 membrane of skeletal muscle by increasing the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein 364 kinase. The extract also reduced the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver by down-regulating 365 glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Choi et al., 2016a). The 366 antidiabetic activity of the aqueous and ethanol extract, as well as their different fractions, has 367 been linked to an enhanced activity of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) and subsequent boost 368 in the assimilation of glycogen in the liver. The increased activity of glycolytic enzymes viz. 369 liver hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in G. procumbens-370 treated mice, also suggested a greater degree of glucose breakdown in the liver (Gansau et al., 371 2012; Lee et al., 2012). G. procumbens has been reported to directly suppress postprandial 372 hyperglycemia. This was attributed to the inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase in vitro. 373 In the case of α-glucosidase, the aqueous extract exerted a comparable inhibition to that of 374 acarbose (IC50 values of 0.092 ± 0.018 and 0.075 ± 0.006 mg/mL, respectively). The extract 375 also inhibited α-amylase (IC50 value of 0.084 ± 0.027 mg/mL) (Choi et al., 2016b). The cellular 376 mechanism and biochemical implications of different G. procumbens extracts have been 377 adequately characterized. This confirms the suitability of this species as a traditional 378 antidiabetic remedy.  379  380 6.2. Anti-oxidant activity 381 6.2.1. G. bicolor 382 The ethyl acetate extract of G. bicolor showed a high phenolic content (10.87 mg of gallic 383 acid equivalents per gram (GAEs/g) of extract) and prominent anti-oxidant activity (IC50 value 384 0.53 ± 0.01 mg/mL) in a DPPH scavenging activity assay (Teoh et al., 2013). Its aqueous and 385 ethanol extracts also showed high phenolic contents (14.28 and 15.69 GAEs/g of extract, 386 respectively). Both extracts exerted prominent protection against oxidative stress in HUVE 387 cells (Chao et al., 2015).  388  389 6.2.2. G. divaricata 390 The total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the 45% aqueous ethanol extract 391 of G. divaricata were determined under different extraction procedures and at varying 392 13  temperatures. Extraction at 100 °C showed a maximum phenolic content of 36.68 ± 0.62 393 GAEs/g of dry plant material and a maximum flavonoid content of 47.52 ± 0.21 mg kaempferol 394 equivalent/g of dry material. The extract obtained at 100 °C also exhibited maximum radical 395 scavenging potential (89.67 ± 0.06% inhibition of DPPH and 68.27 ± 1.36% inhibition of 2,2-396 azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radicals (Wan et al., 2011a). 397 However, no IC50 values were reported, which makes it difficult to compare its anti-oxidant 398 potential with that of other species. 399  400 6.2.3. G. formosana 401 The ethyl acetate extract of G. formosana showed significant radical scavenging activity in 402 the DPPH and ABTS assays, with IC50 values of 11.17 ± 1.83 and 21.82 ± 0.88 µg/mL, 403 respectively. Its anti-oxidant potential was associated with an enhanced level of catalase, 404 superoxide dismutase and glutathione activity and a reduced lipid peroxidation rate in rat liver 405 when administered at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (Ma et al., 2019). Its phenolic 406 constituents such as caffeic acid (40) and quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (107) possessed anti-oxidant 407 activity by scavenging DPPH, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in vitro. In the DPPH assay, 408 the aforementioned compounds exhibited IC50 values of 6.7 and 7.7 µM, respectively (Hou et 409 al., 2005). 410  411 6.2.4. G. japonica 412 Both the ether and ethyl acetate extracts of G. japonica showed potent anti-oxidant activity 413 (Su et al., 1986). The methanol extract showed moderate dose-dependent activity with 36.8 ± 414 0.4% inhibition at 500 µg/mL in a DPPH scavenging assay and 89.5 ± 0.6% inhibition at 1000 415 µg/mL in a β-carotene–linoleic acid assay (Seow et al., 2014b). It is possible that further 416 bioassay-guided fractionation of this extract might have produced better results. 417  418 6.2.5. G. procumbens 419 The ethyl acetate fraction derived from the methanol and ethanol extracts of G. procumbens 420 exhibited the potent activity in the hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, DPPH (IC50, 0.22 ± 421 0.01 mg/mL), ABTS (IC50,0.06 mg/mL) scavenging assays and in the β-carotene–linoleic acid 422 and xanthine oxidase inhibition assays. This anti-oxidant potential was attributed to a high 423 phenolic and flavonoid content (24.36 ± 1.11 mg GAE/g dry fraction and 17.33 ± 1.39 mg 424 catechin equivalent/g dry fraction, respectively) and to inhibition of lipid peroxidation 425 (Kaewseejan and Siriamornpun, 2015; Lee et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2013). A comparative 426 14  investigation, using DPPH scavenging and ferric reducing anti-oxidant power assays, revealed 427 that the roots were richer in phenolics and flavonoids than other plant parts and had stronger 428 anti-oxidant activity (Krishnan et al., 2015). 429  430 6.2.6. G. pseudochina 431 The 40% aqueous ethanol extract showed a strong DPPH radical scavenging activity owing 432 to its high phenolic content (94.24 ± 0.1552 mg GAE/g of dry sample) (Krisyanella et al., 433 2016). This potent free radical scavenging activity was further confirmed in another study using 434 a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazin (DNPH) assay (Suhartono et al., 2016). However, the absence of 435 IC50 values limits comparison with other species. 436  437 6.3. Anti-inflammatory activity 438 6.3.1. G. bicolor 439 The ether extract of G. bicolor, administered at doses of 30, 60 and 120 µg/mL to RAW 440 264.7 cells, showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 441 inflammatory response. This activity was attributed to the capacity of the extract to inhibit the 442 inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 responsible for the synthesis 443 of the pro-inflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 444 respectively. Compared to the control group, the extract at a dose of 120 µg/mL showed a 445 maximum of 30% and 72% reduction in NO and PGE2 production, respectively. The underlying 446 mechanism in this anti-inflammatory response involved a prominent reduction in the 447 expression of the cytosolic phosphorylated (p)-IκBa and nuclear p65 proteins and a subsequent 448 inactivation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) (Wu et al., 2013).  449  450 6.3.2. G. formosana 451 The ethyl acetate extract of G. formosana inhibited the cotton pellet-induced granuloma 452 formation (inflammatory response) in rats by decreasing the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory 453 cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). It showed a dose-454 dependent anti-inflammatory activity at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight, equivalent to that 455 observed for indomethacin used at 4 mg/kg (Ma et al., 2019). 456  457 6.3.3. G. japonica 458 The methanol and chloroform extracts (50 µg of extract/disc) demonstrated significant anti-459 inflammatory activity (76.82 ± 2.10% and 70.76 ± 1.77% inhibition of inflammation, 460 15  respectively) in the Hen’s egg test chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay (Seow et al., 461 2014a).  In the cotton pellet-induced inflammatory assay in rats, G. japonica at doses of 250 462 and 500 mg/kg body weight, significantly reduced the plasma levels of TNFα (62.9 ± 5.5 and 463 72.2 ± 3.5%, respectively). The extract also inhibited the production of IL-1 (89.2 ± 1.2%). 464 Compared to the complete inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin, the methanol extract only showed 465 55.0 ± 0.6% inhibition at a dose of 200 µg/mL. On the other hand, the extract potently inhibited 466 COX-2 activity, even better than celecoxib (86.8 ± 1.5 and 43.3 ± 1.7% inhibition, respectively) 467 (Seow et al., 2014b). 468  469 6.3.4. G. nepalensis 470 The ethanol extract of G. nepalensis showed strong anti-inflammatory activity in the 471 carrageenan-induced paw oedema and xylene-induced ear oedema assays in mice. The extract, 472 at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight, inhibited the paw oedema to a maximum of 77.8 473 and 94.4%, respectively. In the ear oedema assay, the extract at the dose of 500 mg/kg showed 474 a comparable inhibition (36.32%) to that of the standard (38.84%). It also produced significant 475 peripheral analgesia by inhibiting acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced paw 476 licking of mice. The extract, at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, showed 58.98 and 58.28% 477 inhibition of writhing, respectively (Rahman et al., 2018). Further studies should aim to 478 ascertain the possible mechanism of such activity, particularly unravelling whether the extract 479 from this species interferes with cyclooxygenase enzymes. 480  481 6.3.5. G. procumbens 482 The ethanol extract of G. procumbens as well as its hexane and toluene extracts 483 demonstrated topical anti-inflammatory properties as potent as hydrocortisone in the croton 484 oil-induced mouse ear inflammation model. The ethanol extract (0.75 mg per ear) and 485 hydrocortisone (6 mg per ear) showed similar activity (65.2 and 64.8% inhibition, 486 respectively). The hexane and toluene extracts (0.75 mg/ear) showed 44.6 and 34.8% 487 inhibition, respectively. Hydrocortisone (4 mg per ear) showed comparable activity (35.0%) 488 (Iskander et al., 2002). The ethanol extract of G. procumbens suppressed the production of 489 TNF-α and interferon γ (IFN-γ) but promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory 490 interleukin IL-10 (Wong et al., 2015). 491  492 16  6.4. Antimicrobial activity 493 6.4.1. G. divaricata 494 The methanol extract of G. divaricata at 20 mg/mL exhibited moderate activity against 495 Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zones of inhibition of 11.0 ± 0.50 and 496 15.0 ± 0.26 mm, respectively) compared to gentamicin (35.0 ± 0.30 and 27.0 ± 0.50 mm at 75 497 µg/mL, respectively). It also showed moderate activity against Aspergillus flavus and Candida 498 albicans (10.0 ± 0.42 and 13.0 ± 0.26 mm, respectively) compared to ketoconazole (25.0 ± 499 0.50 and 37.0 ± 0.40 mm at 250 µg/mL, respectively). The methanol and the dichloromethane 500 extracts inhibited the growth of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (14.0 ± 0.40 and 13.0 ± 0.26 501 mm at 75 µg/mL, respectively) compared to ketoconazole (16.0 ± 0.20 mm) 502 (Jiangseubchatveera et al., 2015). It is possible that further bioassay-guided fractionation of the 503 methanol extract might have produced better results. 504  505 6.4.2. G. japonica 506 The ethyl acetate soluble fraction of G. segetum (G. japonica) at 50 mg/mL showed strong 507 in vitro inhibitory activity on the growth of S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter 508 aerogenes, P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis (zones of inhibition of 20.0 509 ± 1.0, 18.3 ± 1.2, 13.0 ± 1.0, 23.3 ± 2.0, 17.0 ± 1.0 and 20.7 ± 0.6 mm, respectively). The 510 extract at the same concentration was also active against C. albicans (13.0 ± 1.0 mm) as 511 comparable to that of amphotericin (15.3 ± 0.6 mm at 500 ppm dose) (Seow et al., 2012).  512  513 6.4.3. G. procumbens 514 The methanol extract of G. procumbens showed potent inhibitory activity against the regular 515 (H37Rv) and a multidrug resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The minimum 516 inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 500 ppm compared to that of the standard ofloxacin at 1 517 ppm (Isrul et al., 2018). The methanol extract also showed antibacterial activity against S. 518 aureus, B. subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. At 400 mg/mL, the extract 519 displayed zones of inhibition of 10.5 ± 0.06, 10.0 ± 0.0, 9.7 ± 1.5 and 9.0 ± 0.0 mm, respectively 520 (Nawi et al., 2019).  521 The aqueous and the ethanol extract exerted potent in vitro activity against Plasmodium 522 falciparum 3D7 (IC50 values of 25.69 ± 4.34 and 42.23 ± 7.19 µg/mL, respectively) and P. 523 berghei NK65 (IC50 values of 12.4 ± 6.02 and 14.38 ± 7.53 µg/mL, respectively). An in vivo 524 study in mice demonstrated that G. procumbens reduced the population of P. berghei within 525 erythrocytes. Both extracts, administered at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day for four days, 526 17  exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of parasitaemia and showed a maximum inhibition of the 527 parasitic population (93.06 ± 5.46 and 84.73 ± 3.18%, respectively) at 250 mg/kg body weight. 528 G. procumbens extracts improved survivability in P. berghei-infected mice (mean survival time 529 of 21 days after treatment) (Vejanan et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2015).  530 The ethanol extract of G. procumbens also exhibited potent virucidal activity against Herpes 531 Simplex Virus (HSV), inhibiting viral replication within host cells (Jarikasem et al., 2013). 532 Bioactivity-guided fractionation of these extracts and their subsequent phytochemical 533 investigation is essential in order to identify the constituent(s) responsible for the 534 antiplasmodial and antiviral activities.   535  536 6.4.4. G. pseudochina 537 G. pseudochina inhibited the growth of C. albicans on an acrylic resin denture base 538 (Rahman, 2020). However, the data can be considered limited in absence of suitable standards. 539  540 6.5. Cardioprotective activity 541 6.5.1. G. divaricata 542 An in vitro study of the aqueous extract of G. divaricata reported its ability to inhibit the 543 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) significantly, which further suggested some potential 544 antihypertensive properties for this species. The extract, at a dose of 1.25 mg/mL, exhibited a 545 maximum inhibition of 85.2% with an IC50 value of 370.0 ± 70.0 µg/mL, compared to captopril 546 (IC50, 0.0027 ± 0.0002 µg/mL) (Wu et al., 2011). A recent in vivo study confirmed the 547 antihypertensive potential of G. divaricata in a two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) renovascular 548 hypertensive rat model. The aqueous extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg/day, significantly 549 improved vasodilation in acetylcholine-, sodium nitroprusside- and atrial natriuretic peptide-550 treated rats (97.72, 76.4 and 54.64%, respectively). The extract also enhanced endothelial nitric 551 oxide synthase expression, which in turn, boosted the concentration of vasodilator nitric oxide. 552 Moreover, the extract was found to counteract hypertension-induced ventricular hypertrophy 553 as well as the expression of cardiac dysfunction biomarkers (i.e. brain natriuretic peptide and 554 troponin T). The antihypertensive activity of G. divaricata was further associated with its 555 renoprotective capacities in vivo. The extract significantly reduced urinary volume while 556 increasing the concentration of sodium, potassium and chloride in urine. The aldosterone and 557 angiotensin activity was also restrained along with higher level of creatinine clearance in 558 extract-treated animals (Hong et al., 2020). 559  560 18  6.5.2. G. procumbens 561 The aqueous extract of this species administered at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day over a period 562 of 4 weeks, lowered the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Mean blood 563 pressure values of 191.7 ± 13.2 and 172 ± 14.6 mm Hg were reported for the control and for 564 the extract-treated group, respectively. This finding was attributed to the fact that G. 565 procumbens increased the concentration of the vasodilator molecule nitric oxide by a margin 566 of 60.7%. A decrease in the serum activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphate 567 kinase (up to 34 and 48%, respectively) was also observed (Kim et al., 2006). Another study 568 linked the hypotensive effect of G. procumbens with its ability to inhibit the angiotensin 569 converting enzyme in vitro and in vivo (Hoe et al., 2007). Multiple studies have showed that 570 G. procumbens could lead to vasodilation through direct enhancement of bradykinin activity 571 as well as antagonism of angiotensin II and calcium channel mediated vasoconstriction (Hoe 572 et al., 2011; Poh et al., 2013). Another study suggested that the plant caused vasodilation owing 573 to its ability to increase prostacyclin production and open potassium channels (Ng et al., 2013). 574  575 6.5.3. G. japonica 576 The antiplatelet activity of G. japonica extract and pure compounds was tested using a 577 turbidimetric method where platelet aggregation was induced by thrombin (0.1 U/mL), 578 arachidonic acid (100 µM), collagen (10 µg/mL) and platelet activating factor (2 ng/mL). In 579 the case of arachidonic acid-induced aggregation, the chloroform fraction (100-500 µg/mL) 580 showed 8.1-98.4% inhibition compared to that of aspirin (100% inhibition at both 50 and 100 581 µg/mL doses). The extract also inhibited collagen- and platelet activating factor-induced 582 aggregation (88.1 and 53.8%, respectively). 6-Acetyl-2,2-dimethylchroman-4-one (74) and 583 vanillin (167) were among the isolated compounds, which at the dose of 100 µg/mL effectuated 584 complete inhibition of arachidonic acid induction in a similar manner as aspirin (Lin et al., 585 2003). This, in turn, suggests that their activity may be mediated predominantly through the 586 inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme. 587  588 6.6. Cytotoxic/anticancer properties 589 6.6.1. G. bicolor 590 The hot water extract of G. bicolor exhibited cytotoxic properties by prompting apoptosis 591 in HL60 leukemia cells (Hayashi et al., 2002). Its ethyl acetate extract showed cytotoxicity 592 against HCT-116 and HCT-15 colon cancer cells, mediated through apoptosis and necrosis. 593 After a treatment period of 24 h, the IC50 values obtained for the extract were of 16.0 ± 4.5 594 19  µg/mL in the HCT-116 cell line (cisplatin, IC50 of 12.0 ± 0.7) and 12.8 ± 5.3 µg/mL in the 595 HCT-15 cell line (cisplatin, IC50 of 6.2 ± 0.4) (Teoh et al., 2013). Chlorogenic acid (56) and 596 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (63) isolated from this species showed selective cytotoxicity against 597 HCT-116 cells (IC50 values of 79.7 ± 4.5 and 79.3 ± 3.1 µg/mL, respectively) (Teoh et al., 598 2016). 599  600 6.6.2. G. cusimbua 601 Several phenylpropanoid glycosides isolated from the n-butanol extract of G. cusimbua 602 were investigated for their anti-angiogenic properties. Two compounds, namely α-L-603 rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-[4′′-(8E)-7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-8-propenoate,1′′-O-(7S)-7-604 (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-7-methoxyethyl]-glucopyranoside (82) and spicaoside (83), 605 significantly suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated cell 606 proliferation in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Their IC50 values 607 (12.65 ± 0.06 and 14.09 ± 0.78 µM, respectively) were comparable to the standard axitinib 608 (4.57 ± 0.92 µM). Three more compounds viz. β-hydroxy-verbascoside (77), betonyoside A 609 (80) and 3′,9,9′-trihydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy-8-O-4′-neolignan-4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (84) 610 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity (IC50 values of 52.43 ± 0.51, 21.52 ± 0.24, and 33.25 ± 0.62 611 µM, respectively). A similar effect was observed in vivo where all five compounds suppressed 612 vascular formation in the wild-type zebrafish (IC50 values of 3.1 ± 1.3, 3.3 ± 1.5, 13.2 ± 5.1, 613 11.3 ± 4.8 and 15.7 ± 6.9 µM, respectively) compared to the standard semaxanib (2.9 ± 1.4 614 µM) (Ma et al., 2019). The cytotoxic potential of these lead molecules investigated through 615 both in vitro and in vivo methods warrant further clinical investigation.  616  617 6.6.3. G. divaricata 618 The essential oil from G. divaricata showed cytotoxicity against the oral cancer KB, breast 619 cancer MCF-7, and lung cancer NCI-H187 cell lines (IC50 values of 5.79 ± 0.04, 47.44 ± 0.19 620 and 17.65 ± 0.13 μg/mL, respectively). This contained cubenol (205) which exhibited an IC50 621 value of 45.37 ± 2.94 μg/mL (Jiangseubchatveera et al., 2015). The aqueous extract inhibited 622 cellular proliferation as well as tumor growth in Huh7, Mahlavu and Hep3B liver cancer cells 623 to a moderate degree (< 70 % cytotoxicity). At a dose of 250 μg/mL, the extract potentiated the 624 anticancer property of cisplatin (7.36-fold increase in activity), 5-flurouracil (4.03-fold) and 625 doxorubicin (2-fold) in vivo (Yen et al., 2018). Gynuraoside (145), a cerebroside isolated from 626 the ethanol extract of the aerial parts of G. divaricate, dose-dependently inhibited the 627 proliferation of L1210 leukemia cells (95% inhibition at 20 μg/mL) (Chen et al., 2009b). 628 20   629 6.6.4. G. formosana 630 The ethyl acetate extract of G. formosana showed activity against HeLa, HepG2, and MCF-631 7 cells (IC50 values of 81.47, 100.94, and 104.76 μg/mL, respectively) (Ma et al., 2018). Its 632 cytotoxicity was attributed to an inhibition of autophagy-mediated cell proliferation. Further 633 studies should include comparative screening using multiple standards and a characterization 634 of the biochemical markers affected by this extract in order to ascertain the molecular 635 mechanism of action.  636  637 6.6.5. G. japonica 638 Different G. segetum (G. japonica) extracts showed potent anti-angiogenic activity by 639 reducing the size and the number of blood vessels in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane 640 (CAM) assay. Compared to the standard suramin (50 μg per disc), the chloroform extract 641 exhibited the highest activity, followed by the petroleum ether and the methanol extract, each 642 at concentrations of 100 μg per disc (Seow et al., 2011). Further studies using cell lines and 643 suitable standards are required to strengthen these observations. 644  645 6.6.6. G. medica 646 G. medica is rich in kaempferol (87) which showed strong dose-dependent cytotoxicity 647 against the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line. This flavonoid, at concentrations of 20, 40 648 and 80 μM, showed 26.3%, 49.7% and 77.3% inhibition of cellular growth, respectively. 649 Kaempferol (87) also induced apoptosis by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and 650 down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 (Yi et al., 2016). 651  652 6.6.7. G. procumbens 653 The cytotoxic properties of the ethanol extract of G. procumbens were investigated in a 654 squamous cell carcinoma induced in the tongue cells of mice by the carcinogenic agent 4-655 nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO). Significant inhibition of dysplastic changes in the tongue cells 656 suggested that this species displayed potent anticancer properties (Agustina et al., 2006). The 657 ethanol extract, at doses of 50 and 100 μg/mL, inhibited the cellular proliferation of fetal bovine 658 serum-activated mesangial cells by reducing the expression of platelet-derived growth factor 659 (PDGF-BB), transforming growth factor (TGFβ1) and cyclin dependent kinase (CDK1 and 660 CDK2) (Lee et al., 2007). It suppressed the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced 661 mammary carcinoma in Sprague Dawley rats (up to 60 % at 250 mg/kg of body weight) 662 21  (Meiyanto et al., 2007). The same extract, at doses of 300 and 750 mg/kg body weight, also 663 exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity against DMBA-induced hepatic carcinoma in 664 Sprague Dawley male rats (Nisa et al., 2012). The ethyl acetate extract of this species 665 suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB as well as the ribosomal expression of the NF-666 κB p65 protein leading to a reduced cellular proliferation and metastasis of U2-OS 667 osteosarcoma cells. The extract, administered at concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 μg/mL, 668 inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When applied at 80 669 μg/mL over 24 h, the extract led to apoptosis in 37.94% of cells (Wang et al., 2013). The 670 cytotoxic effect of G. procumbens could be attributed to the activation of CD4+ T lymphocyte 671 cells as a result of an increased expression of certain interleukins viz. IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12) by 672 helper T cells (Takanashi et al., 2019). This was supported by the fact that G. procumbens 673 could activate CD4+ T cells by enhancing the expression of CD25 molecules and suppressing 674 the expression of CD26L molecules (Dwijayanti and Rifa’i, 2015). The ethyl acetate extract 675 enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin and 5-flurouracil in MCF-7 and T47D 676 breast cell lines. In MCF-7 cells, the combination therapy induced c-PARP mediated apoptosis 677 leading to cell death (Nurulita et al., 2012). One study reported the cytotoxic properties of 678 protein fractions against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Hew et al., 2013). The anticancer 679 activity of G. procumbens extracts has been well characterized through in-depth studies, but 680 extensive phytochemical investigations are now warranted to identify the constituent(s) 681 responsible for such activity and develop new anticancer drug leads.  682  683 6.6.8. G. pseudochina 684 Anticancer activity against human gastric KATO-III cells was reported for the peptide 685 gynurin (301) isolated from G. pseudochina rhizomes (Chaichana et al., 2019). Bioactivity-686 guided fractionation revealed a fraction with an IC50 value of 100 µg/mL. Further investigation 687 on this fraction yielded gynurin (IC50 value of 100 µM). This compound had a minimal 688 cytotoxic effect on normal cells at the same potency. Structural modification of this active 689 compound might be necessary in order to obtain molecules with better activity. 690  691 7. Safety and toxicity studies 692 Few systematic studies have been conducted on the safety and toxicity of Gynura species. 693 The methanol extract of G. bicolor was investigated for acute oral toxicity in healthy male 694 Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0.3, 2 and 5 g/kg of body weight over a period of 14 days. The 695 22  absence of any visual and behavioural signs of toxicity suggested that this species was 696 relatively safe for oral consumption (Teoh et al., 2013).  697 An extract of G. japonica, and its PAs, were evaluated for oral toxicity in a mice model at 698 a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight. Profound hepatic damage characterized by a breakdown 699 of hepatocytes, clot formation within hepatic sinusoids and penetration of inflammatory cells 700 into hepatic lobules was observed for both samples. These histological changes, along with 701 increased levels of hepatic markers viz. alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, 702 total bilirubin and total bile acids, led to a hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (Xiong et 703 al., 2019).  704 Studies on the acute oral toxicity of G. procumbens at doses of 1 and 5 g/kg body weight 705 administered were conducted in BALB/c mice for a period of 7 days. A similar characterization 706 of the hepatic microsomal P450 contents between the control and extract-treated group as well 707 as the absence of any neural or respiratory side effects, showed that this extract was safe when 708 taken orally at both doses (Zhang et al., 2000). Another study evaluating the acute and sub-709 chronic toxicity of G. procumbens in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 1.25, 710 2.5 and 5 mg/kg of body weight revealed no noticeable changes in physical, behavioural, 711 hematological and histological parameters. This demonstrated the oral safety of this species 712 (Yam et al., 2009). However, more preclinical data need to be produced, conducting in-depth 713 toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies of all the species, before further clinical trials. 714  715 8. Critical assessment and perspectives 716 The major species of the genus Gynura in ethnomedicine are used mainly in the treatment 717 of diabetes, cancer and hypertension. Prominent antidiabetic properties have been reported for 718 G. bicolor, G. divaricata, G. medica and G. procumbens through in vitro and in vivo studies. 719 This has yet to be demonstrated in case of G. formosana, G. japonica, G. nepalensis and G. 720 pseudochina, which are employed in diabetes. Specific constituents responsible for the reported 721 antidiabetic properties have been identified from G. divaricata and G. medica, but remain to 722 be isolated from G. bicolor and G. procumbens. Several phytoconstituents of G. divaricata, 723 namely 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (61), methyl 3,4-dicaffeoylquinate (62), 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic 724 acid (63), 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (66) and methyl 4,5-dicaffeoylquinate (67), with prominent 725 antidiabetic activity in vitro, have also been reported wholly or partly in G. bicolor, G. 726 nepalensis, G. procumbens and G pseudochina. All or some of the antidiabetic constituents of 727 G. medica namely quercetin (88), kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucoside (99), kaempferol-3-O-728 23  rutinoside (101) and rutin (107), have also been identified in G. bicolor, G. formosana and G. 729 procumbens. Therefore, bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations are warranted into G. 730 bicolor and G. procumbens, to evaluate if the aforementioned compounds form the basis of the 731 antidiabetic properties of these plants. In-depth antidiabetic and phytochemical screenings of 732 G. formosana and G. nepalensis are also required to assess their potential as antidiabetic 733 remedies. The similarity in terms of phytoconstituents is also reflected in the underlying 734 mechanism of these plants in exerting antidiabetic activity. Four plants viz. G. bicolor, G. 735 divaricata, G. medica and G. procumbens exert their antidiabetic activity through inducing 736 hypoglycemia. To that end, G. bicolor, G. divaricata and G. medica enhanced insulin secretion 737 while carbohydrate digesting enzymes were inhibited by G. divaricata, G. medica and G. 738 procumbens, reducing carbohydrate digestion and intestinal absorption. Moreover, both G. 739 divaricata and G. procumbens can enhance cellular glucose uptake and subsequent glycolysis, 740 as well as increase the rate of liver glycogenesis. The multiplicities of mechanisms supporting 741 the antidiabetic properties of different Gynura spp. are illustrated in Figure 17.  742 All the species mentioned in this review possess prominent anticancer activity. Although 743 most of the studies were performed on specific cancer cell lines, this was not the case for G. 744 japonica which employed a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay to ascertain anti-745 angiogenic activity (Seow et al., 2011). The translation of in vitro cytotoxicity into in vivo 746 anticancer activity is often unattainable due to the lack of selectivity and subsequent unwanted 747 interactions. In vivo cytotoxicity was only demonstrated for G. cusimbua (Ma et al., 2019) and 748 G. procumbens (Meiyanto et al., 2007; Nisa et al., 2012) in wild-type zebrafish and Sprague 749 Dawley rats, respectively. The cellular mechanisms of action and the selectivity were only 750 outlined for G. procumbens extract and G. medica-derived kaempferol (87). Therefore, future 751 in-depth investigations into the Gynura spp. are required to establish their in vivo selectivity, 752 interactions, and anticancer potential. Individual phytoconstituents with significant cytotoxic 753 activity have been isolated from G. bicolor, G. cusimbua, G. divaricata, G. medica and G. 754 pseudochina. One or all of the cytotoxic compounds of G. bicolor namely senecionine (6), 755 chlorogenic acid (56) and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (63), have also been reported from G. 756 divaricata, G. medica, G. nepalensis, G. japonica, G. procumbens and G. pseudochina, further 757 reinforcing their anticancer potential. Further bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations 758 are required into these species to identify any additional cytotoxic secondary metabolites. 759 Whilst G. bicolor, G. formosana, G. japonica, G. nepalensis and G. procumbens have 760 displayed substantial anti-inflammatory activity, the same cannot be said for G. divaricata and 761 G. pseudochina (despite being both used ethnomedicinally to treat inflammation and 762 24  inflammation-associated conditions). It should be added that the detailed mechanisms involved 763 in the anti-inflammatory effect of G. bicolor and G. nepalensis are yet to be explored. Further 764 bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations into these plants are also required. All species, 765 except for G. nepalensis, exert their anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing the levels of 766 TNF-α and pro-inflammatory interleukins. G. japonica and G. bicolor have also demonstrated 767 a common ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme. G. bicolor and G. procumbens 768 suppressed nuclear factor Kappa B. This was further attributed to the anti-inflammatory activity 769 of G. bicolor and the anticancer activity of G. procumbens. Future investigations may be 770 targeted to extend the anti-inflammatory properties of G. bicolor to potential anticancer activity 771 and vice-versa. Figure 18 illustrates the shared mechanisms involved when the aforementioned 772 species exert their anti-inflammatory effect.  773 Ethnomedicinal records have reported the use of G. bicolor, G. divaricata, G. formosana, 774 G. japonica and G. nepalensis for the treatment of hypertension. Such a claim was only 775 substantiated in the case of G. divaricata. Interestingly, G. procumbens demonstrated 776 antihypertensive properties although not reported as a traditional antihypertensive remedy. 777 Both G. divaricata and G. procumbens act on the cardiovascular system in a comparable 778 manner, inhibiting the ACE and lowering the plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels 779 (Figure 17). The traditional use of G. japonica for its anti-platelet effect has been validated 780 pharmacologically, including the identification of pure compounds responsible for such action 781 (Lin et al., 2003). Future in vivo experimentations are warranted in order to reciprocate such 782 action. Future work should also endeavor to assess the antihypertensive potential of other 783 Gynura species.  784 All major Gynura species, except for G. cusimbua and G. medica, possess noticeable anti-785 oxidative potential demonstrated through one or more in vitro assays. This has only been 786 replicated in vivo for G. bicolor and G. formosana. The anti-oxidant activity of G. bicolor, G. 787 divaricata, G. procumbens and G. pseudochina has been associated with the presence of 788 several phenolics and flavonoids (Table 2).  789 The antimicrobial activity of G. divaricata and G. japonica, demonstrated through in vitro 790 assays, reinforces their ethnomedicinal claims. Further in vivo studies are necessary, 791 particularly to support the ethnomedicinal use of G. divaricata for bronchitis and tuberculosis. 792 The traditional reports of G. cusimbua being employed against infections also require 793 validation through appropriate pharmacological studies. The antimicrobial and antiplasmodial 794 properties demonstrated for G. procumbens might extend its traditional applications. 795 25  Despite the variety of pharmacological studies already carried out to support the traditional 796 uses of Gynura spp., many more traditional uses are yet to be substantiated. This includes the 797 renoprotective potential of G. procumbens, the anti-herpetic potential of G. pseudochina and 798 the uterine-associated effects of G. bicolor. The use of Gynura species in the treatment of burns, 799 wounds, bruises, bleeding, ulcers, boils and scalds as well as to improve gastric conditions such 800 as constipation and discomfort also requires further pharmacological investigations.  801 Most of the experimental studies using mice models reported in this review followed the 802 conventional practice of using 1/10th of the maximum non-lethal dose as the highest 803 concentration to be administered (common maximum doses of 400 or 500 mg/kg). Some 804 studies extended this limit to 750 mg/kg (Meiyanto et al., 2007; Nisa et al., 2012) and 1000 805 mg/kg (Hassan et al., 2010). In such cases, further toxicological studies are/or the re-evaluation 806 of the experimental parameters using lower doses are required. Further in vivo work as well as 807 detailed oral toxicity studies are warranted to establish the safety profile of G. divaricata, G. 808 formosana, G. medica, G. nepalensis and G. pseudochina for traditional use. 809  810 9. Concluding remarks 811 The genus Gynura, which has a long history of use in traditional medicine, has demonstrated 812 a wide variety of biological effects that support many of its uses. Gynura species have already 813 afforded a broad spectrum of phytoconstituents and further bioactivity-guided phytochemical 814 analyses of these plants could generate promising leads for new drugs. In light of the renewed 815 worldwide interest towards herbal medicine, Gynura spp. represent an interesting alternative 816 to conventional treatments for a range of disorders, especially diabetes, hypertension, cancer, 817 inflammation and related disorders. Many Gynura species are also used as nutritional food and 818 deemed safe to be consumed occasionally. Further studies should establish conclusively the 819 efficacy and long-term safety of regular consumption of these plants. 820  821 Declaration of Competing Interests  822 None 823  824 Funding 825 This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, 826 commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. 827  828 26  References 829 Agustina, D., Wasito, W., Haryana, S.M., Supartinah, A., 2006.
