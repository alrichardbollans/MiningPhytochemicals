The aim of this review is to systematically appraise the literature available to date on phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, toxicology and bioactivity (in vitro and in vivo) of crude extracts and purified compounds.  Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plants of the genus Drypetes (Putranjivaceae) are used in the Subsaharan African and Asian traditional medicines to treat a multitude of disorders, like dysentery, gonorrhoea, malaria, rheumatism, sinusitis, tumours, as well as for the treatment of wounds, headache, urethral problems, fever in young children, typhoid and several other ailments. Some Drypetes species are used to protect food against pests, as an aphrodisiac, a stimulant/depressant, a rodenticide and a fish poison, against insect bites, to induce conception and for general healing. This review deals with updated information on the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and biological activities of ethnomedicinally important Drypetes species, in order to provide an input for the future research opportunities. Methods: An extensive review of the literature available in various recognized databases e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, SciFinder, Web of Science, www.theplantlist.org and www.gbif.org, as well as the Herbier National du Cameroun (Yaoundé) and Botanic Gardens of Limbe databases on the uses and bioactivity of various species of the Drypetes was undertaken. Results: The literature provided information on ethnopharmacological uses of the Subsaharan African and Asian species of the genus Drypetes, e.g., Drypetes aubrévillii, D. capillipes, D. chevalieri, D. gerrardii, D. gossweileri, D. ivorensis, D. klainei, D. natalensis, D. pellegrini (all endemic to Africa) and D. roxburghii (Asian species), for the treatment of multiple disorders. From a total of 19 species, more than 140 compounds including diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes (friedelane, oleanane, lupane and hopane-type), flavonoids, lignans, phenylpropanoids and steroids, as well as some thiocyanates, were isolated. Several crude extracts of these plants, and isolated compounds displayed significant analgesic, anthelmintic, antidiabetic, anti-emetic anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, central nervous system depressant, cytotoxic, and insecticidal activities both in vitro and in vivo. Some toxicities associated with the stem, bark, seed and leaf extracts of D. roxburghii, and the flavonoid, amentoflavone, isolated from the stem extract of D. littoralis as well as D. gerrardii, were confirmed in the animal models and in the rat skeletal myoblast cells assays. As a consequence, traditional medicine from this genus should in future be applied with care.  Conclusions: Plants of this genus have offered bioactive samples, both from crude extracts and pure compounds, partly validating their effectivity in traditional medicine. However, most of the available scientific litteratures lacks information on relevant doses, duration of the treatment, storage conditions and positive controls for examining bioefficacy of extract and its active compounds. Additional 3  toxicological studies on the species used in local pharmacopeia are urgently needed to guarantee safe application due to higth toxicity of some crude extracts. Interestingly, this review also reports 10 pimarane dinorditerpenoids structures with the aromatic ring C, isolated from the species collected in Asia Drypetes littoralis (Taiwan), D. perreticulata (China), and in Africa D. gerrardii (Kenya), D. gossweileri (Cameroon). These compounds might turn out to be good candidates for chemotaxonomic markers of the genus.  Keywords: Drypetes, Ethnopharmacology, Chemical constituents, Bioactivities  1. Introduction The genus Drypetes, previously put in Euphorbiaceae family, has been included within the  Putranjivaceae based partly on the presence of the mustard oils in their leaf tissus, a compound they share with the genus Putranjiva in this family and because its was the sole pantropical zoochorous genus of the Euphorbiaceae. The Putranjivaceae was formerly a tribe (Drypeteae) of the subfamily Phyllanthoideae in the Euphorbiaceae. When the Phyllanthoideae was separated to form the new family Phyllanthoideae, it was decided that Drypeteae also could stand alone (APG III, 2009). The greatest diversity of the genus Drypetes is found in Asia, with about 120 known/documented species. Approximately 75 species grow in Africa and Madagascar, with around 20 species, many of them as yet unexplored, found in the Americas. Most species are narrowly distributed, but D. roxburghii is found in seasonal forests from Pakistan to Indonesia (Levin, 2014). Plants of the genus Drypetes are trees or shrubs, with alternate, coriaceous or chartaceous and entire or toothed leaves; stipules are caducous and rarely persistent. Pedicellate male and female flowers are arranged in bundles in the axils of the leaves, or are produced on older branches or the stem. Flowers of this genus are dioecious and petals absent: male flowers have globose buds, and four or five broad, imbricate, usually coraceous septals. Typically, three or more stamens are inserted around and at the base of a central flat concave or occasionally cupular disk, and filaments are free. Anthers are erect and often large with parallel cells dehiscing longitudinally, and a rudimentary ovary is either absent or represented by a small conical protrusion in the middle of the disk. In common with the male flower the female version display a calyx, with a hypnogynous annular or cupular disk. The ovary has between one and four cells with 2 ovules in each cell; styles are short or absent and stigmas thick, flattened, bifid or undivided and more or less reniform. Fruits are globose, ellipsoid or ovoid and indehiscent with a thick, woody pericarp surrounding a solitary seed (by abortion) with fleshy albumen displays 1-4 cells. The embryo is straight with flat, broad cotyledons (Baker, 1913). The classification developed by Pax and Hoffmann in 1922, although still valid today, is not completely congruent with postulated phylogenetic (Fig. 1) and evolutionary relationships (Wurdack 4  et al., 2004, Levin, 2014). For example, Drypetes roxburghii (Wall.) Hurus. (Synonym: Putranjiva roxburghii Wall.) is the accepted name. Thus, this review aims to present a synopsis on the ethnopharmacological uses and more than 140 secondary metabolites produced by the members of the Drypetes genus. In addition, bioactivities of assayed extracts and chemical constituents are also presented.

Materials and methods  In order to assess the uses, chemical constituents and bioactivities of the crude extract as well as isolated compounds from the genus Drypetes, a wide range of literature sources were interogated (e.g. Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, SciFinder, Web of Science, as well as the Herbier National du Cameroun (Yaoundé) and Botanic Gardens of Limbe databases). Critical reviews of plant taxonomy were sourced from www.theplantlist.org and plant occurrence from www.gbif.org. Relevant bibliographic items were identified systematically in the relevant libraries by searching for key terms including Drypetes, ethnobotany, ethnopharmacology, medicinal plants, chemical constituents, etc. Initially other terms were considered such as natural products, pharmacognosy, folk medicine and botany, but then excluded since their use did not result in relevant references. Four libraries with holdings both on useful/medicinal plants/pharmacognosy and the history of medicine/pharmacy were selected: Le Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle de Paris, The School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Herbier National du Cameroun, Yaoundé and Botanic Gardens of Limbe, Cameroon. These libraries contain relevant literature, which span a wide time period and most importantly cover the period prior to the introduction of electronic databases. The books chosen were searched for relevant information. Most but not all sources are written in English.  3. Results and discussion 3.1. Traditional medicinal use of species of the Drypetes genus 5  Various species of the genus Drypetes are narrowly distruibuted in tropical forested areas of Asia and utilised in a range of mostly unreported traditional medicinal applications. D. roxburghii, however, has wide ranging traditional medicinal applications for its fruits, seeds and leaves from Pakistan to Indonesia. This species is also found in the tropical Americas, and was introduced to Subsaharan Africa decades ago for medicinal purposes. In Subsaharan Africa, nine Drypetes species are used in traditional medicines, with the bark having multiple, prominent medical uses. Ethnopharmcological information on the Drypetes genus goes back to data collected from African species by Ainslie (1937), Bouquet (1969), Bouquet and Debray (1974), Burkill (1985), Cooper and Record (1931), Dalziel and Hutchinson (1937), Kerharo and Bouquet (1950), and Rapoda-Walker and Sillans (1961). Further ethnomedicinal knowledge on African and Asian species has been added by natural products chemists in the course of chemical and pharmacological investigations (table 1).  Table 1.

Drypetes aubrévillei Leandri Drypetes aubrévillei Leandri (locally called “Duamoko” in West African countries) grows in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Ghana and Ivory Coast. The bark and fruit are used for general healing on the skin and mucosa, while the bark alone is utilised for pulmonary disorders and analgesic applications. Unspecified parts of the plant are also used as a febrifuge (antipyretic) (Burkill, 1985). In Liberia, a decoction of macerated bark and fruit is used as a liniment for application in fever, Nkundo region of Congo Back pain, insect bites, and dental caries Bark shavings rubbed onto skin Otitis Stem bark juice Muganza et al.

Pap made from the bark is also used as an expectorant and bronchial decongestant (Bouquet and Debray, 1974).  3.1.2. Drypetes capillipes (Pax) Pax & K. Hoffm. Drypetes capillipes (Pax) Pax & K. Hoffm. (locally called “mò.kàmá” in Central African countries, and “gbólóga” by Baka Pygmies) grows in the Central African countries, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Central African Republic. The leaves and bark are widely used for general analgesia (Burkill, 1985). In Congo (Brazzaville), a bark decoction is used as a mouth-wash for severe toothache, and an enema for kidney-pains, while the leaves are applied in topical massage for stiffness of the neck (Bouquet, 1969). 3.1.3. Drypetes chevalieri Beille ex Hutch. & Dalziel Drypetes chevalieri Beille ex Hutch. & Dalziel (locally called in Nigeria, “sunsun-iro” or “aya” by Yoruba and “owe” or “aghedan” by Edo) is found in Ivory Coast, Liberia, Gabon, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and The Democratic Republic of Congo. In Cameroon, the plant is used locally for the treatment of tumours, swellings, inflammation and gonorrhoea (Dalziel and Hutchinson, 1937; Bouquet and Debray, 1974). Sap expressed from leaves and twigs is taken in draught by the ‘Kru’ and the Guere of Liberia for dysentery, and the powdered leaves are sometimes used in Ivory Coast as a snuff for head-colds and sinusitis (Kerharo and Bouquet, 1950). The leaf is used in west tropical Africa for "intestines"; pulmonary troubles and naso-pharyngeal affections, while the sap is used against diarrhoea and dysentery (Burkill, 1985). 3.1.4. Drypetes gerrardii Hutch; synonym: Drypetes gerrardii var. gerrardii Drypetes gerrardii Hutch (locally called “Itulelei tree” in Kenya) grows in Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania, Malawi, South Africa, Mozambique, Uganda and Swaziland, and is reported to be used to treat malaria and other ailments among 'Chonyi' people in Kilifi District, Coast province, Kenya (Ng′ang′ a et al., 2011).  3.1.5. Drypetes gossweileri S. Moore; synonym: D. armoracia Pax & K. Hoffm. Drypetes gossweileri S. Moore (locally called “horseradish tree” in English; “bologa” or “kode” or “olelang” in Cameroon; “gama”or “n´zongo” or “ngama” in Central African Republic; “bonsole”, “boshimi” or “muyuyungu” or “pilipili” or “vungu” or “yungu” in Congo; “akot” or “ossôgho” in Gabon; “agawo” or “okhuaba” in Nigeria) is found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Cameroon. While the root is applied for general healing, the bark is used for analgesia, vermifuge, genital stimulant/depressant, against veneral diseases, as febrifuge, reptile-repellent, and as fish-poison (Burkill, 1985). In Western Cameroon, the bark is adminstered for the treatment of gonorrhoea and toothache (Dalziel and Hutchinson, 1937), while unspecified parts of the plant are also used in the Central African Republic against helminthic 9  diseases, rheumatism, fever and malaria (Ngoupayou, 2003, Tchinda and Sob, 2008, Raponda-Walker and Sillans, 1961). Bark and fruit are used for poison fishing (Raponda-Walker and Sillans, 1961). Furthermore, a bark-macerate or decoction with pepper is used in Gabon as an anthelminthic, and in Congo (Brazzaville) as a vermifugal enema (Bouquet, 1969). In addition, the bark is used in the treatment of rheumatism, headaches, general pain, body-pains, helminths and filariasis in Gabon (Raponda-Walker and Sillans, 1961; Bouquet, 1969; Akendengue and Louis, 1994), whereas the roots are applied to wounds and for toothache (Troupin, 1982). In Congo, the bark powder is cooked together with bananas and taken to relieve urethral discharge or as an aphrodisiac, while a powder-decoction is added to bath water for the relief od fever in young children. The bark is also reported to repel snakes, if a piece is kept in the hut-roof, or boiled bark water is sprinkled around the perimeter of the hut (Bouquet, 1969). In the Nkundo region of Congo bark shavings are rubbed onto skin for the treatment of rib or back pain, insect bites, and is also placed under the affected tooth in the case of dental caries. Stem bark juice is administered otically against otitis (Muganza et al., 2012), and certain populations in Congo use bark preparations as an antipyretic, analgesic and aphrodisiac, for body pain, headache and urethral problems, respectively (Bouquet, 1969). Bark and fruit are used as fish-poison in Gabon (Raponda-Walker and Sillans, 1961), and in Nigeria, the roots are powdered with kola and Celtis integrifolia to treat deep wounds (Ainslie, 1937). Like in Gabon, the bark is used by the Aka pygmies and the Monzombo people in the Central African Republic for poison fishing, and the plant is also used in the Boukoko area during postharvest to protect food against pests (Aba et al., 2013, Motte, 1980). Finally, medicines from the bark are prepared by local people in Osun State for the treatment of fever, malaria and typhoid (Kajode et al., 2008).  3.1.6. Drypetes ivorensis Hutch. & Dalziel; synonym: Drypetes pierreana A. Chev. Drypetes ivorensis Hutch. & Dalziel (locally called “Kpahn-wee”) grows in Liberia, Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Gabon. The bark and fruit are used in skin and mucosa treatments, while the bark is additionally applied as a rodenticide, mammal and bird poison (Burkill, 1985). Furthermore, bark and fruit are used to prepare dressings to mature boils and carbuncles. The bark is considered toxic in Ivory Coast, and is used by the Akye to prepare poison bait for rats, mice and other noxious animals (Kerharo and Bouquet, 1950; Bouquet and Debray, 1974). 3.1.7. Drypetes klainei Pierre ex Pax Drypetes klainei Pierre ex Pax (locally called “zogre or rokobasoki or rokobasole”) grows in Liberia, Cameroon, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and Gabon. The bark of this plant is widely used as an analgesic and vermifuge, and together with the fruit as a fish poison (Raponda-Walker and Sillans, 1961; Burkill, 1985). In Gabon, a macerate or decoction of fresh bark is applied topically for treatment of rheumatism, and with a piment internally as an anthelminthic (Raponda-Walker and Sillans, 1961). 10  3.1.8. Drypetes natalensis (Harv.) Hutch; synonym: Drypetes natalensis var. natalensis Drypetes natalensis (Harv.) Hutch (locally called “Natal drypetes or Natal ironplum” in English; in Southern Africa: “Natalsysterpruim, stinkbos, iKushwane elikhulu, umBejiza, umGunguluza, umGunguluzane, umKushwane” by Zulu and “umKhiwane” by Xhosa) grows in Mozambique, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya, and Malawi. It is predominantly used for the treatment of malaria and other ailments in Tanzania (Gessler et al., 1995). 3.1.9. Drypetes pellegrini Leandri; synonym: Drypetes vignei Hoyle Drypetes pellegrini Leandri (locally called “omenewa-hoakoa” in Ghana) is endemic to Ghana and Ivory Coast. The bark is used as an Ivorian multi -purpose medicine (Aubréville, 1959). 3.1.10. Drypetes roxburghii (Wall.) Hurus.; synonym: Putranjiva roxburghii Wall. Drypetes roxburghii (Wall.) Hurus. (locally called “Amulet-Plant or Wild Olive or Child-Life-Tree” in India) grows in The United States, India, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and Trinidad and Tobago; it was introduced for cultivation to Subsaharan countries for a variety of medicinal applications. The leaves are used in India in the treatment of catarrh, skin disease, fever, cold, rheumatism and sterility (Chopra et al., 1970b), and fruit, seeds and leaves have various application as an aphrodisiac, a tonic to aid conception and for the treatment of filarial diseases (Kumar,  2014c). Crushed seeds are applied to insect bites by the S-Pitonj, MP-Pitinjia, and M-Pitaunji tribes in the Bihar region, India (Kumar et al., 1998); the leaves and fruit are also used in India for the treatment of muscle twisting, arthralgia and rheumatism (Shahwar et al., 2012). Among the tribes of Uttar Pradesh, India, scattered leaves are spread on the maternity room floor for an easy delivery, and a garland of its dried seeds is worn to protect from red pimples and allergy (Singh and Bisht, 1999). Unspecified parts of the tree are reported to be used in India against cold, fever, rheumatism and inflammation (Sudharshan et al., 2009). In the 'Chatara' block of district Sonebhadra, Uttar Pradesh, India against various parts of the plant are used to treat cold, dysentery, fever, as well as an aphrodisiac, stimulant and spermopoietic; leaf sap is used as an optic lavage to wash infected eyes (Singh et al., 2010). In the Vidarbha region, Maharashtra, India, the leaf is used for the treatment of viral fever (Kumar and Chaturvedi, 2010). In Gorakhpur division, India, leaves and stones are given as a decoction for cold, fever and rheumatism (Pandey and Tripati, 2011), and tribes of the Sirmour district, Himanchal Pradesh, India, orally apply the nuts  to aid conception and promote the birth of a male child (Thakur, 2011). In Nagpur, India, the plant is traditionally applied used for coughs, cold and fever (Maurya and Dongarwar, 2012). The fruit is used in the District of Uttar Pradesh, India as an aphrodisiac, antiinflammatory, for habitual abortion, as a laxative in addition to the treatment of elephantiasis, eye infection and sterility (Singh and Dubey, 2012). A paste composed of the seeds is given traditionally applied to the forehead for the treatment of pain; seeds are also taken orally, for around one month, by women trying to conceive. 11  A leaf poultice along with the leaves of Dalbergia sissoo and Vitex negundo is applied for the treatment of joint pain (Kumar, 2012). Traditional use of the leaves and fruit against cold, rheumatism, and swollen throat in India has also been reported (Sharma and Bhadange, 2013). The bark is applied by the local people in Nalgonda and Warangal districts of Andhra Pradesh, India for the treatment of cough (Sreeramulu et al., 2013). In the Khulna division, Bangladesh it is used for its curative properties in folk medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (Mollik et al., 2009). Traditional healers in Bangladesh apply the plant for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders: 250 mg of powdered seeds are taken every 4 h with a little sugar and water (Kadir et al., 2013).  3.2. Phytochemistry Chemical investigation of the species of the Drypetes genus began when Puntambekar (1950) reported three thiocyanate-derived compounds, 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranose-2-methyl-N-(sulfooxy)propanimidoyl (glucoputranjivin, 1), (2S) 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranose-N-(sulfooxy)-sec-butylanimidoyl (glucojiaputin, 2) and its isomer (2R) 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranose-N-(sulfooxy)-sec-butylanimidoyl (glucocochlearin, 3) from the steam volatile oil of wet kernels of the Asian D. roxburghii. In addition, two glucoside compounds, (2S) 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranose-N-(sulfooxy)-2-hydroxymethylbutylisothiocyanate (glucocleomine, 4) and (2S) 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranose-N-(sulfooxy)-2-methylbutylisothiocyanate (5) were identified from the seeds and from the volatile hydrolysis product from kernels (Fig. 2) (Kjaer and Friis, 1962, Kjaer and Thomson, 1962). In the years that followed, a number of new and known compounds were isolated from this species, but realistically, chemical research on African species did not start before 1997.   Figure 2. Structures of compounds 1-5  In the meantime, nineteen African and Asian species have been investigated providing a total of 142 compounds, belonging to various classes of secondary metabolites.   OOHHOHO SOHCN CH3CH3SOOOOOHHOHO SOHCN CH2CH3SOOOCH3HOOHHOHO SOHCN CH2CH3SOOOHCH3OOHHOHO SOHCH2NCSOOOOHH3CCH2CH3OOHHOHO SOHCH2NCSOOOCH3HCH2CH31. 2. 3.4. 5.H12  3.2.1. Triterpenoids Three main classes of triterpenoids were isolated from this genus: one linear triterpenoid, squalene (6), from the leaves of D. hieranensis Hayata (Pax & K. Hoffm.) (Chen, 1999) as well as in huge quantities from the leaves and stems of D. cumingii Baill. (Pax & K. Hoffm.) (Sun, 2014); one tetracyclic triterpenoid, 3β-acetoxycycloart-24-en-23-one (7) reported from the leaves of D. roxburghii (Mukherjee, 2012) (Fig. 3); and five subclasses of pentacyclic triterpenoids (friedelane, oleanane, lupane, hopane and adianane).    Figure 3. Structures of compounds 6 and 7  3.2.1.1. Pentacyclic triterpenoids 3.2.1.1.1. Friedelane  The first friedelane (Fig. 4) isolated from this genus was putanjivadione (8) from the trunk bark of the Asian D. roxburghii (Garg and Mitra, 1968b) and it was shown to be friedelane-3,7-dione (Sengupta and Chakraborty, 1968). Subsequently, the compound was re-isolated from the African species D. gossweileri (Sow et al., 1994; Ngouela et al., 2003; Wandji et al., 2003); D. molunduana Pax. & K. Hoffm. (Wandji et al., 2000); D. chevalieri (Wansi et al., 2006, 2007); D. gerrardii (Ng´ang´a et al., 2008); D. laciniata Pax. (Hutch.) (Fannang et al., 2011); the Asian D. hainanensis Merr. (Chen et al., 2014) as well as from D. roxburghii (Sengupta and Mukherjee, 1968; Chopra et al., 1970b, Mukherjee et al., 2012). The synthetic compound 7,8-epoxyfriedelane (9) was produced by a series of chemical reactions from putranjivadione (8) (Dey and Banerjee, 1995). Three isomers of this compound, drypemolundein B (10), 3-oxofriedelan-25-al (11) and 3,15-dioxofriedelane (12) were isolated from eight Cameroonian species: D. molunduana, D. gossweileri (Wandji et al., 2000, 2003), D. chevalieri (Wansi et al., 2007), D. parvifolia (Müll. Arg.) Pax. & K. Hoffm. (Nenkep et al., 2008), D. tessmanniana Pax. (Pax. & K. Hoffm.) (Dongfack et al., 2008), D. paxii Hutch. (Chiozem et al., 2009), D. inaequalis Hutch. (Awanchiri et al., 2009) and D. laciniata (Fannang et al., 2011). Friedelin (13), a compound originally described from cork by Chevreul in 1807, was reported from the two Asian species D. roxburghii (Garg and Mitra, 1968b; Sengupta and Mukherjee, 1968; Chopra et al., 1970b; Mukherjee et al., 2012) and D. hainanensis (Chen et al., 2014) and, in the following as O76OH3CO13  well from the African species D. gossweileri (Sow et al., 1994; Ngouela et al., 2003, Wandji et al., 2003), D. littoralis (C. B. Rob.) Merr. (Lin et al., 2001), D. chevalieri (Wansi et al., 2006, 2007), D. gerrardii (Ng´ang´a et al., 2008, 2012), D. parvifolia (Nenkep et al., 2008), D. tessmanniana (Dongfack et al., 2008), D. paxii (Chiozem et al., 2009), D. inaequalis (Awanchiri et al., 2009), and D. laciniata (Fannang et al., 2011). Its isomer friedelan-7-one (14) was isolated from D. paxii (Chiozem et al., 2009). Two trioxofriedelanes, 3,6-dioxo-D:A-friedo-oleanan-24-al (15) and 3β-hydroxyfriedelane-7,12,22-trione (16) were isolated from D. chevalieri (Wansi et al., 2007) and D. laciniata (Fannang et al., 2011), respectively. Furthermore, friedelan-3β-ol (17), its stereoisomer epifriedelanol (18), epifriedelanol methyl ether (19) and 5β,24-cyclofriedelan-3-one (20) were isolated from D. amoracia (Wandji et al., 2003), D. tessmanniana (Dongfack et al., 2008) and D. gerrardii (Ng´ang´a et al., 2008, 2012; Hata et al., 2014). Friedelane-3α,16β-diol (21), its isomer friedelane-3β,29β-diol (22) and the oxydized isomer 3-oxo-friedelan-29-ol (23) were reported from D. hieranensis and D. congestiflora Chuin & T. Chen. (Chen et al., 1999, Chen, 2015). Furthermore, from the Camerooninan species D. paxii and D. inaequalis as well as the two Asian species D. hoanensis Gagnep. and D. roxburghii, four compounds were isolated, namely 12α-hydroxyfriedelane-3,15-dione (24), 3β-hydroxyfriedelan-25-al (25), 3α-hydroxyfriedelan-7-one (26), 3α-hydroxyfriedelan-12-one (27), 3α-hydroxyfriedelan-25-al (28) and roxburghonic acid or 3-ketofriedelan-25-oic acid (29) (Garg and Mitra, 1968b, 1971a; Awanchiri et al., 2009; Chiozem et al., 2009; Wittalai et al., 2014). Four seco-friedelane, putanjivic acid or 3,4-sec-friedelan-4(23)-en-3-oic acid (30), methylputranjivate (31), putranjic (putric) acid or 2-hydroxy-3,4-seco-D:A-friedooleanan-3-oic acid (32) and methylputranjate (33) were isolated from D. roxburghii (Garg and Mitra, 1968b, 1969; Chopra et al., 1968, 1970a; Aojagi et al., 1973). Five nor-friedelane, hainanenone or 4-hydroxy-23-nor-friedel-3-one (34), hainanenone A or 23-nor-friedel-3-one (35), putrone or 3-oxo-25-nor-friedel-9(11)-ene (36), putrol or 3α-hydroxy-25-nor-friedel-9(11)ene (37) and putralone or 10α-hydroxy-25-nor D:A friedo-olean-9(11)-en-3-one (38) were isolated from D. hainanensis (Chen et al., 2014; He et al., 2015) and D. roxburghii (Chopra et al., 1968; Aiyar et al., 1973; Mukherjee et al., 2012). The suggested structure of 36 was supported by its conversion into D:A-friedo-oleana-7,9 (11)-diene, and it was also reported to have been synthesized from 25-acetoxy-D:A-friedo-olean-7-ene (Sengupta et al., 1979). The compounds 3α-(E)-caffeoyloxyfriedelan-7-one (39) and 3α-(E)-p-coumaroyloxyfriedelan-7-one (40) were isolated from the DCM extract of the roots of D. hoanensis (Wittalai et al., 2014). 14     R1 R2 OO8.

Furthermore, the EtOH/H2O (95/5) extract of the twigs and leaves of D. perreticulata contained collinsogenin (57) (Ge et al., 2014). A crystalline triterpenoid saponin named putranjivoside (58) was isolated from the seed coat of D. roxburghii and was established to be 3β-L-arabino-L-rhamno-D-glucoside of oleanolic acid (Garg and Mitra, 1968a). Furthermore, the benzene extract of the leaves of D. roxburghii gave β-amyrin (42) and a β-amyrin palmitate (59) (Chopra et al., 1968). The DCM-MeOH (1:1) extract of the stem of D. chevalieri afforded a triterpenoid named drypechevalin A or 11-oxo-β-amyrin-3β-ylcaffeate (60) (Wansi et al., 2006). From the MeOH extract of the stem bark of D. tessmanniana, a 3β-O-(E)-3,5-dihydroxycinnamoyl-11-oxo-olean-12-ene (61) was reported (Dongfack et al., 2008).

Furthermore, the extract of the stem bark of D. parvifolia delivered a flavan glycoside, 7-hydroxy-5-O-β-D-glucopyranosideflavan (129), and an unusual chalcone glycoside, (Z)-4´,6´-dihydroxy-2´-O-β-D-glucopyranosidechalcone (130) (Nenkep et al., 2008), while the EtOH extract of fresh leaves of D. roxburghii yielded gallocatechin (131) (Chopra et al., 1970b). In addition, a biflavonoid, namely putraflavone or 7,4′'′-dimethyl amentoflavone (132), was isolated from the acidic fraction of the alcoholic extract of the leaves of this plant (Garg and Mitra, 1971b). Finally, xanthone 1-hydroxy-7-hydroxymethyl-6-methoxyxanthone (133) and anthraquinone drypearmoracein B or 2,3-dihydroxy-OOHOHOOHOH122.119.  R1 = R2 = OCH3121.

Structures of compounds 135-139 Furthermore, stearic acid (140) reported from the bark of D. gossweileri (Dupont et al., 1997). In addition, two liposoluble constituents from the leaves and stems of D. cumingii afforded the fatty acid ethyl ester ethyl oleate (141) and disparlure or 2-methyl-7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane (142), also a pheromone of the gypsy moth (Sun et al., 2014) (Fig. 15).    Figure 15. Structures of compounds 140-142  From D. roxburghii seeds, a multifunctional ~12 kDa heterodimeric protein named putrin belonging to 2S albumin family was purified, characterised and cloned (Tomar et al., 2014). In addition, a highly stable trypsin inhibitor was isolated from the seeds of D. roxburghii. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 34 kDa and inhibits bovine trypsin in 1:1 molar ratio (Chaudhary et al., 2008).   3.3. Biological activity of crude extracts and pure compounds    Plants of the genus Drypetes are used in the Subsaharan African and Asian traditional medicines due to its broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities. The varied ethnomedicinal uses of the different species of Drypetes have led to the initiation of many biological investigations.

Kuete et al., 2010  3.3.1. Antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activity No species of the genus Drypetes is traditionally used to treat leishmaniasis, African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease (trypanosomiasis). However, some crude extracts and compounds have been tested on these diseases. The DCM-MeOH (1:1) stem extract of D. gerrardii showed moderate in vitro activity against Leishmania donovani MHOM/ET/67/L82 with IC50 7.31 mg/mL. The isolated saponin putranoside A 62 and phenanthrenone derivative, drypetenone D 92, showed weak  activity against Leishmania donovani with IC50 7.8 µM and 14.0 µM, respectively compared to the positif control (miltefosine IC50 of 0.552 µM). The same solvent extract of the leaves showed moderate activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900 strain, with IC50 12.1 mg/mL, while the same isolated compounds showed weak  activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense with IC50 18.0 µM and 6.0 µM, respectively compared to the positif control (melarsoprol IC50 of 0.003 µM) (Hata et al., 2014). Malebo et al. (2009) reported the antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities of the ethanolic stem and the root bark extracts of D. natalensis against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900 with IC50 10.70 µg/mL and against Leishmania donovani MHOM-ET-67/82 with IC50 19.0 µg/mL for the stem bark, and with IC50 12.10 µg/mL against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900, and IC50 29.7 µg/mL against Leishmania donovani for the root bark. The DCM-MeOH (1:1) extract of the stem of D. chevalieri delivered the furanoeudesm-1-on-13-oic acid 100 which displayed significant antileishmanial activity against Leishmania major (88/DESTO) promasitigotes with IC50 40.0 μg/mL compared to the positive control pentamidine with IC50 38.0 μg/mL (Wansi et al., 2007). Improved "crude" drugs from active fractions of D. natalensis and D. chevalieri might be alternatives to modern antileishmanial and antitrypasnosomal drugs, subject to careful toxicity studies employing human normal cell lines and toxicity tests in animal model.  3.3.2.  Antiplasmodial activity 32  Five species of Drypetes (D. aubrévillei, D. gerrardii, D. natalensis, D. gossweileri and D. roxburghii) have been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat malaria and fever, and as insect-repellent. Only three species and the isolated compounds have been assessed for their antimalarial activity (Hata et al., 2014; Ng'ang'a et al., 2011; 2012; Lin et al., 2001; Haldar et al., 2013). The DCM-MeOH (1:1) stem extract of D. gerrardii inhibited the chloroquine-resistant African Plasmodium falciparum NF54 with IC50 0.50 µg/mL. From this extract, the isolated compounds, drypetenone D 92 and drypetenone E 93, showing weak activity against Plasmodium falciparum NF54 with IC50 0.9 μM and 2.04 μM, respectively compared to the positive control chloroquine with IC50 0.004 µM. These compounds also showed a CC50 68.4 µM and CC50 64.0 µM, respectively against rat myoblast cell line L6, compared to the positive control podophyllotoxin with CC50 0.019 µM, resulting in a selectivity index SI 71 and 31.4, respectively. However, drypetenone D 92 was inactive in vivo against Plasmodium berghei mouse model (Hata et al., 2014). In addition, 5β,24-cyclofriedelan-3-one 20 isolated from the EtOAc extract of the stem of D. gerrardii, exhibed antiplasmodial activity with IC50 2.2 µg/mL compared to the positive control chloroquine with IC50 0.063 and artemisinin with IC50 0.002. This compound displayed and CC50 21.2 µM against rat myoblast cell line L6 compared to podophyllotoxin with a CC50 0.009 µM, resulting in a selectivity index SI 9.64. Resinone 66 isolated from the same extract, displayed high antiplasmodial activity with IC50 0.09 µg/mL and displayed and CC50 of 84.8 µM against rat myoblast cell line L6, resulting in a favourable selectivity index of 942.2 (Ng'ang'a et al., 2011; 2012). Lin et al., (2001) reported the potent antiplasmodial activity of amentoflavone 128 with IC50 2.6 µg/mL, compared to the positive control chloroquine with IC50 0.063 µg/mL and artemisinin with  IC50 0.002 µg/mL, but Ng'ang'a et al. (2011; 2012) indicated that the activity observed was probably due to the toxicity rather than selective activity against the parasite. The EtOH extract of the root bark of D. natalensis displayed IC50 1.06 µg/mL against the chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum K1 (Thailand) compared to chloroquine with IC50 0.063 μg/mL and artemisinin with IC50 0.002 μg/mL, and a CC50 19.0 against rat skeletal myoblast cell line L-6. Activities resulted in an SI value of 17.9, indicating no toxicity when applied in antiplasmodial therapy. Furthermore, the EtOH extract of the stem bark displayed an IC50 1.42 µg/mL against Plasmodium falciparum K1 compared to chloroquine with IC50 0.063 μg/mL and artemisinin with IC50 0.002 μg/mL, and a CC50 88.9 against rat skeletal myoblast cell line L-6. Activities resulted in an SI 62.61 (Malebo, 2009), indicating as well no toxicity when applied in antiplasmodial therapy. Interestingly, highly stable silver nanoparticles with average dimension of 26.6 nm synthesized by dried green fruit of  D. roxburghii displayed strong mosquito larvicidal activity against Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles stephensi. The 50 % lethal concentration (LC50) values for second, third and fourth larval instars after 24 h of exposure to the nanoparticles were 0.8632, 1.1619, and 1.2814 ppm against Culex quinquefasciatus, and 0.7329, 0.8397 and 0.9848 33  ppm against Anopheles stephensi, respectively. Toxicity tests on the non-target organism Poecilia reticulata (Pisces) showed no harmful effect at 0.8397 ppm, the LC50 concentration used for third instar A. stephensi larvae (Haldar et al., 2013). The extracts and isolated compounds showed some significant antiplasmodial activity associated with a high cytotoxicity against rat skeletal myoblast cell line L-6. These result showed that the extract and the compounds can no kill the parasites without damaging mammalian cells. However, further research work on D. natalensis is urgently needed 3.3.3. Antibacterial  activity All species of the genus Drypetes are locally used as antimicrobial agents. Due to the prevalence of multi-drug resistant bacteria and their low susceptibility to antibiotics, nearly all extract have been tested for their antibacterial activity. The DCM extract of the stem bark of D. gossweileri showed antibacterial activity with MIC values of 0.25 to 1.00 mg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocoleteca, Enterobacter cloacae and Salmonella sp. (Ndouga et al., 1991). The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark clearly inhibited S. aureus, Pseudomonas aerugosina, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp. and Escherichia coli, causative agents of urinary tract infections, with the ethanol extract exhibiting the highest inhibitory activity with MICs ranging between 3% and 7% (Ijah and Oyebanji, 2003). Furthermore, the DCM-MeOH (1:1) extract of the bark displayed antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori strain CCUG 39500 with MIC 0.78 mg/mL compared to amoxicillin with 0.0062 mg/mL and against Campylobacter jejuni/coli strain CPC-022004 as well with 0.78 mg/mL, compared to amoxicillin with MIC 0.0062 mg/mL (Tan et al., 2006). Importantly, Ngouana et al., (2010) reported that the extract did not show any signs of toxicity in rats up to 1000 mg/kg dose, with the exception of male rats at 1000 mg/kg dose where a light diminution in body weight was observed. Morphological examination of various organs and statistical analysis of relatives organs weight revealed that there were no differences between the control groups which received distilled water and maize oil and treated rats. Furthermore, lup-20(29)-en-3β,6α-diol 67 and 28β-D-glucopyranosyl-30-methyl-3β-hydroxyolean-12-en-28,30-dioate 50 isolated from the whole stem of ripe fruit of D. inaequalis, assayed by agar diffusion well at a concentrations of 200 µg/mL, displaying inhibition zone diameters of 11 to 15 mm against S. aureus, E. coli, and Salmonella typhi, compared to the positive control gentamycin displaying 34, 35 and 42 mm of inhibition zone (Awanchiri et al., 2009). In addition, from the methanol extract of the whole stem of D. laciniata, the isolated compound, 3β-hydroxyfriedelane-7,12,22-trione 16 showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus ATCC25922, S. typhi ATCC6539, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, E. coli ATCC 10536, with gentamicin as positive control angainst E. coli with MIC 256 mg/mL, P. aeruginosa with MIC 256 mg/mL, and S. typhi with MIC 512 mg/mL. Chikusetsusaponin IVa methyl ester 56 displaying also inhibitory activities on the growth of E. coli with MIC 256 mg/mL and S. typhi with MIC 512 µg/mL (Fannang 34  et al., 2011). From the methanolic stem extract of D. paxii, 12α-hydroxyfriedelane-3,15-dione 24 and 3β-hydroxyfriedelan-25-al 25 together with friedelin 13, friedelan-7-one 14, and 28β-D-glucopyranosyl-3β-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oate 52 were tested in an agar well diffusion assay at 200 µg/mL displaying inhibition zones of 17, 14, 11, 10, 15 respectively 21 mm against S. aureus, compared to gentamycine with 34 mm, while compound 52 was as well active in this assay against E. coli with 18 mm and S. typhi with 17 mm, compared to gentamycine displaying 35 respectively 42 mm of inhibition zone diameter (Chiozem et al., 2009). Furthermore, the extracts of D. perreticulata were reported to display marginal antibacterial actvity against S. aureus ATCC 1339, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, P. aeruginosa ATCC 14886 and E. coli ATCC 8739 (Chen et al., 2012). The twigs and leaves of this plant extracted with EtOH/H2O (95:5) afforded dryperrein D 98 which displaying marginal activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 and B. subtilis in a microdilution assay compared to the positive control ofloxacin (Ge et al., 2014). 3β-O-(E)-3,5-dihydroxycinnamoyl-11-oxo-olean-12-ene 61 and 3β, 6α-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene 69 were submitted to paper disc agar diffusion assays employing  methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. faecalis LMP806, B. cereus LMP716, β-lactamase positive E. coli LMP701, ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae LMP803, ampicillin-resistant Shigella dysenteriae LMP820, carbenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMP804, and chloramphenicol-resistant Citrobacter freundii LMP802. MICs determined at 80 µg per disc. displayed low activities in a range of  > 625 to 156.25 µg/mL compared to gentamycin with 4.88 to 39.06  µg/mL (Kuete et al., 2010). The DCM-MeOH (1:1) extract of the  the leaves of D. roxburghii was reported to show antibacterial activity in a preliminary assay using agar dilution-streak method, where extracts were mixed with agar at 500 µg/mL and 1000 µg/mL and test strains streaked at the solidified surface. At 500 µg/mL, the extract completely inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Streptococcus faecalis MTCC 8043 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 (Kumar et al., 2006). In addition, from seeds extract of the plant, a multifunctional ~12 kDa heterodimeric protein named putrin was isolated and shown to inhibit weakly Micrococcus flavus and Bacillus subtilis. Values of antibacterial activity were not shown (Tomar et al., 2014). Interestingly, it was noted that the methanolic seeds extract was not toxic in Artemia salina assay displaying LD50 427.74 µg/mL (Raghavendra et al., 2010). A more promising ethnopharmacological approach would be to focus on plants used for the treatment of wounds to prevent infections (main causative agent: Staphylococcus aureus), urinary tract infections (Escherichia coli), ear infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae), or gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoea) using multiresistant test strains. 35  However, the systematic data on the chemical constituents and their pharmacological activities are limited. Thus, studies on the antimicrobial effects and mechanisms of the genus Drypetes are long overdue. 3.3.4. Antifungal activity The antifungal properties of the DCM-MeOH (1:1) stem bark crude extract of D. gossweileri were assayed by broth dilution method against Candida albicans, C. glabrata, Microsporum langeroinii, M. gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagerophytes and  Aspergillus flavus resulting in MICs 24.41, 48.84, 12500, 12500, 12500, 6250 and 12500 µg/mL, compared to the positive control amphothericin with MIC 2.44 µg/mL for Candida, Microsporum species and with MIC 3.125 µg/mL for Trichophyton and Aspergillus. Moreover, the extract was tested for acute toxicity on male and female albino Wistar rats. Extract doses of 0, 4, 8, and 12 g/kg body weight were administered per os to 4 groups of animals of both sex. The rats were observed for  48 h for death and for 7 days for toxic effects. Interestingly, no toxic effects were recorded up to a dose of 12 g/kg of body weight (Ngouana, 2011). From the MeOH extract of the stem bark, the isolated β-amyrone 43 and N-β-glucopyranosyl-p-hydroxyphenylacetamide 117, exhibiting  activity against C. albicans with MIC 16 µg/mL and 8.0 μg/mL, respectively (Ata et al., 2011). The aglycone of compound 117 showed weak active in this bioassay, with an MIC 32 μg/mL, indicating that this activity migth be due to the presence of a N-glucose moiety in compound 117 (Matochko, 2010; Ata et al., 2011). At 50 ppm, the essential oil of the cork of D. gossweileri inhibited mycelial growth of Colletotrichum dematium and Acremonium apii by 100% (Ndonkeu et al., 2013). Dryperrein D 98 isolated from the twigs and leaves of the EtOH/H2O (95:5) extract of D. perreticulata displayed antifungal activity against C. albicans ATCC 1600 and Saccharomyces sake ATCC 26421strains at 50 µg/mL in agar dilution method with amphothericin B as positive control (Ge et al., 2014). Furthermore, the DCM -MeOH (1:1) extract of the  the leaves of D. roxburghii was reported to show antifungal activity in a preliminary assay using agar dilution-streak method, where extracts were mixed with agar at 500 µg/mL and 1000 µg/mL and test strains streaked at the solidified surface. At 500 µg/mL, the extract completely inhibited the growth of C. albicans MTCC 10231, but not of A. niger MTCC 1344, compared to the positive control amphotericin B which showed complete inhibition at 3 µg/mL (Kumar et al., 2006). In addition, aqueous leaves and fruit extracts of the same plant showed a reduction to 9.33% of Solanum melongena seed infection by A. flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata, and Phomopsis vexans compared to 66% fungal infection of untreated seeds (Kuri et al., 2010, 2011). The essential oil of the same plant was found to be fungicidal and thermostable at its MIs of 400 ppm against A. flavus and A. niger.  The oil protected  peanut seeds completely for 6 months at 0.25 and 0.38 mL in containers of 250 mL capacity holding 200 g seeds against above fungi and the insect pest Trogoderma granarium. It did not exhibit any adverse effect on seed germination, seedling growth 36  and general health and morphology of plants (Tripathi and Kumar, 2007).  The leaves oil of this plant inhibited mycelial growth of Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, and  A. terreus with 48.48, 38.75, 15.71, 48.23% at a concentration of 500 ppm and of Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, F. chlamydosporum, F. equestri, F. monoliforme, F. avenaceum, Alternaria solani and  Humicola griseus at 700 ppm, the growth of Absidia spinosa, Acremonium album, F. nivale and Penicillium funiculosum (95%), and  at 1000 ppm the growth of  Rhinopsus nigricans,  P. chrysogenum, P. glabrum and P. oxalicum. Moreover, the fungitoxicity was not destroyed by autoclaving and storage upto 120 days (Pandey and Tripati, 2011; Kumar, 2013, 2014a, 2014b). Interestingly, a multifunctional ~12 kDa heterodimeric protein named putrin reported from the seeds displayed an IC50 value of 34.7 μM  against A. flavus (Tomar et al., 2014). Compounds, 3β-O-(E)-3,5-dihydroxycinnamoyl-11-oxo-olean-12-ene 61 and 3β, 6α-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene 69 isolated from the methanolic extract of the stem bark of D. tessmanniana, were inactive to paper disc agar diffusion assays employing the fungi Candida albicans LMP709U and Microsporum audouinii LMP725D (Kuete et al., 2010).  3.3.5.  Cytotoxic activity Hoaensieremone 107 isolated  from the air-dried 95% EtOH/H2O extract of the stems of D. congestiflora was shown to exhibit moderate cytotoxic activity against human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A 549 as well as murine mouse melanoma cell line B16 F10, with IC50 values of 27.5 respectively 41.3 µM (Chen et al., 2015). Stearic acid 140 reported from the bark of D. gossweileri (Dupont et al., 1997) was reisolated from Oldenlandia diffusa and proven to display significant inhibitory effects on the growth of human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B with IC50 90 µM respectively 130 µM, and displayed only 20% inhibition of the normal human liver cell line WRL-68. Mechanistic studies showed that both cell types were more sensitive towards stearic acid when comparing with other fatty acids, and potential for hepatoma treatment was suggested (Tang et al., 2007). Hainanenone 34 isolated from the EtOH extract of the leaves of of D. hainanensis, displayed moderate growth inhibitory activity against human hepatom cell line BEL7402, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, and human leukemia cell line HL60 at the concentration of 10-5 mol/L with 3.0, 9.7 respectively 4.1% inhibition compared to adriamycin displaying 54.4, 72.2 respectively 89.6% inhibition (Chen et al., 2014). Further phytochemical investigation of  D. hainanensis resulted in the isolation of three phenylpropanoids, named drypetesins A-C 112-114 exhibiting potent cytotoxic activities against human hepatoma cell line HepG2, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7, and human lung carcinoma cell line A-549 cancer cell lines with  IC50 values of 5.6, 8,2 and 6.7 µM for drypetensin A 112, 12.2, 9.4 and 12.5 µM for drypetensin B 113 and 14.8, 12.4 and 10.8 µM  for drypetensin C 112 compared to doxorubicin displaying 1.3, 0.78 and 0.57 µM  (Zhang et al., 2015). From the DCM extract of the roots of D. hoanensis, (E)-caffeoyloxyfriedelan-7-one 39, 3α-37  (E)-p-coumaroyloxyfriedelan-7-one 40, and 3α-hydroxyfriedelan-12-one 27 were isolated and evaluated against acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-3, human cholangiocarcinoma cell line HuCCA-1, human lung cancer cell line A549  and hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 displaying highly significant cytotoxicity against the latter cell line with IC50 values of 0.1, 3.1, 0.3 µM, respectively. Furthermore, five compounds namely hoaensibenzofuranal 103, hoaensieudesone 104, hoaensifuranonal 105, hoaensieremodione 106 and hoaensieremone 107 were submitted to cytotoxicity assays. Compounds 105 and 107 showed moderate cytotoxic activity against acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-3 with IC50  values of 16.8 and 14.6 µM, while compound 106 showed weak cytotoxic activity with 74.8 µM. Compound 107 was weakly active against human cholangiocarcinoma cell line HuCCA-1 and  hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 with IC50 of 51.9 and 72.4 µM (Wittalajai et al., 2014). In addition, the petroleum ether extract of D. perreticulata exhibited a broad spectum cytotoxic activity with IC50 from 76.0 to 682.5 µg/mL in MTT assay (Chen et al., 2012). In vitro cytotoxic activities against human lung tumor cell line A549 and leukemia cell line HL60 showed for dryperrein A  95 and B 96 only weak cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cell line A549 cell line with IC50 91.72 µM and 88.54 µM, respectively, and against leukemia cell line HL60 with IC50 68.59 µM and 65.08 µM, respectively. However, compounds dryperrein C 97 and D 98 displayed moderate inhibitory activities against A549 cell line, with IC50 of 8.50 and 9.45 µM, respectively. Interestingly, compounds 97 and 98 showed strong inhibition against the leukemia cell line HL60 with IC50 1.95 and 1.37 µM, respectively. The cytotoxicity results suggested that the presence of Δ1 double bond in  dryperrein C 97 and D 98 is crucial to the cytotoxic activities of this class of dinorditerpenoids, while alteration of 6-substuent (OH/OMe) has little effect on their activities. Adriamycin was used as positive control with IC50 values of 0.47 µM and 0.12 µM against human lung cancer cell line A549 and leukemia cell line HL60, respectively (Ge et al., 2014). A toxicity profile of these both compounds against humal normal cell lines still needs to be done before their medicinal potential can be commented. At 100 ppm, the methanolic bark extract of D. roxburghii displayed 93.47 % inhibition of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 compared to the positive control adriamycin with 100 %, while Artemia salina used in toxicity assay displayed only 10% inhibition at this concentration, compared to the leave extract of Annona cherimolia as positive control showing 100% inhibition. The negative control DMSO gave 0.6 respectively 3.3% inhibition, which was tolerable (El-Manawaty et al., 2013). At 10-5 mol/L, putanjivadione 8 isolated from the trunk bark of D. roxburghii (Garg and Mitra, 1968) showed 4.0, 21.1 and 43.1% inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL7402, human lung cancer cell line A549 and leukemia cell line HL60 compared to the positive control adriamycin displaying 54.5, 72.2 and 89.6 % inhibition, friedelin 13  was inactive in above cytotoxicity assays.  Putranjivadione 8 is a keto derivative, and it was observed that the ketone groups at C-3 and C-7 considerably increased the cytotoxicity against 38  tumor cell lines compared to hainanenone 34 and friedelin 13  (Chen et al., 2014). The methanolic extract from leaves of D. sepiaria exhibited cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cell line SiHa with an IC50 of 10 μg/mL (Gadamsetti et al., 2013a). Positive and negative controls are not reported.  3.3.6. Antidiabetic activity No species of the genus Drypetes is traditionally used to treat diabetes. However, some crude extracts and compounds have been tested for antidiabetic activity. Maslinic acid 49 and oleonolic acid 48 delivering α-glucosidase inhibition with an IC50 value of 5.52 respectively 6.29 µg/mL (Hou et al., 2009). Compound, N-β-glucopyranosyl-p-hydroxyphenyl acetamide 117, isolated from the methanolic extract of the bark of D. gossweileri, exhibiting high α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC50 12.0 μM. Acidic hydrolysis afforded its aglycone, which exhibited an α-glucosidase inhibition activity with an IC50 60.0 μM suggesting that the higher potency of compound 117  was due to the presence of an N-glucose moiety (Matochko, 2010; Ata et al., 2011). In addition, β-amyrone 43 exhibited α-glucosidase inhibition with an IC50 value of 12 µM  (Ata et al., 2011). For compounds 43 and 117, no positive controls and toxicity against normal mammalian cell lines were reported. Furthermore, the ethanolic extract of the leaves of D. roxburghii was subjected to antidiabetic activity in rats where alloxan monohydrate (120 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) was used as the diabetogenic agent. At a dose of 250 mg/kg, significant antihyperglycemic activity on the 4th, 7th and 10th day post treatment with fasting blood glucose level of 258.23, 255.85, respectively 252.06 mg/dL compared to the positive control glibenclamide at a dose of 10 mg/kg displaying 205.25, 183.18, respectively 178.13 mg/dL was measured (Varma et al., 2010). However, it should be pointed out that the 70 % methanol extract of dried leaves of the same plant showed acute oral toxicity with LD50 500 mg/kg body weight in female Wistar albino rats (Rajahamsa et al., 2013), while the 80% EtOH (v/v) leaves extract significantly induced mitosis-disruptive chromosomal changes in bone marrow cells of mice when administered at 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg body weight/day for seven consecutive days (Awasthy et al., 2000). Further work on the D. gossweileri and the respective compounds regarding toxicity is recommended, since they might be a good alternative in Subsaharan countries for the treatment of diabetes. 3.3.7.  CNS depressant activity Sudharshan et al. (2009) reported the CNS depressant activity of 100 mg/kg MeOH extract of D. roxburghii administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) seedsin a mouse model. Depression of the CNS was assessed with a digital actophotometer which operates on photoelectric cells connected with a counter, and records when a beam of light falling on the device’s photocell is cut off by a test animal. 39  Locomotion was significantly inhibited (38.59%) 45 mins after dosing compared to 5 mg/kg i.p. diazepam (16.35%). 3.3.8.  Analgesic activity  A recent investigation of the analgesic properties of an aqueous extract of D. gossweileri stem bark in mice and rats (Bomba et al., 2013) revealed that both 100 and 200 mg/kg doses significantly decreased nociception induced by intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered acetic acid measured as writhing (abdominal constrictions and hind limbs stretching) inhibition percentage of 45.79 and 66.06% (p < 0.01 and p <0.001), respectively. Similarly, analgesia for neurogenic and inflammatory pain were examined in rats by injecting 20 μL of 2.5% formalin into the subplantar of the right hindpaw, 1 h after the aqueous D. gossweileri extract had been administered. Sensation of pain was quantified from time spent licking the injected paw 0-5 min post-injection (first phase neurogenic pain indicator) and 15-30 min post-injection (second phase inflammatory pain indicator). In the first phase, 200 mg/kg aqueous extract significantly reduced (47.41% inhibition) pain sensation (p <0.01). During the second phase, the effects of the aqueous extract on pain sensation were dose dependent: inhibition of 36.27% for 100 mg/kg, 55.84% for 200 mg/kg, and 65.4% for 400 mg/kg aqueous extract. Assessment of pain induced by pressure indicated that 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses of the aqueous extract significantly reduced pain sensation, with maximum inhibition (54.44%) observed with 200 mg/kg. The authors concluded that these results suggest the presence of secondary metabolites with analgesic properties in the aqueous extract of D. gossweileri (Bomba et al., 2013). Pharmacological screening showed significant analgesic effects of a crude stem bark extract of D. molunduana and the isolated compound, drypemolundein A 99 (Nkeh et al., 2001, 2003). An ether extract of D. roxburghii leaves administered orally at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg resulted in dose dependent analgesic effects, against to counteract writhing pain following acetic acid treatment in mice (Reanmongkol et al., 2009). The analgesic activity of the MeOH extract of D. roxburghii seeds was evaluated by tail flick method and activity was greater than the standard drug (Sudharshan et al., 2009). Another D. roxburghii extract showed dose dependent analgesia again in an acetic acid-induced writhing model, but dose independent activity in hot plate and tail flick models, compared to indomethacin (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) (Rajahamsa et al., 2013). 3.3.9.  Anti-inflammatory activity Drypetes species have been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat inflammation including edema and rheumatism; however, only three species have been assayed for their anti-inflammatory effects. The pharmacological screening of the stem bark crude extract of D. molunduana showed significant anti-inflammatory effects (Nkeh et al., 2001). Drypemolundein A 99 isolated from this extract, significantly reduced paw edema with 57.57 % and 66.66 % inhibition at 1 h intervals, respectively at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg  per os. The ether extract of D. roxburghii leaves showed 40  moderate anti-inflammatory activity at (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, administered orally) in carrageenin-induced paw edema, decreased croton oil-induced anus edema at 800 mg/kg high dose in rats and displayed a dose-dependent (1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/ear) inhibitiion of croton oil-induced ear edema in mice (Reanmongkol et al., 2009). Kaushik et al. (2012) reported that the acetone extract of the leaves showed significant reduction (32.47% and 24%, respectively) in a rat model of carregeenan or dextran-induced inflammation. When orally administered at 500 mg/kg, the 70% MeOH extract of D. roxburghii dried leaves and stems showed anti-inflammatory activity by significantly suppressing carrageen-induced paw oedema, to comparable indomethacin (15 mg/kg) treatment levels. Croton-induced ear edema was also significantly reduced (49.2%) when the MeOH extract was applied topically (5.0 mg/ear), again to indomethacin comparable levels treatment (59.1%) (Rajahamsa et al., 2013), while the 80% EtOH (v/v) leaf extract significantly induced mitosis-disruptive chromosomal changes in bone marrow cells of mice when administered at 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg body weight/day for seven consecutive days  (Awasthy et al., 2000). The petroleum ether, EtOAc, MeOH and aqueous extracts obtained from leaves of D. sepiaria were tested for anti-inflammatory activity with variable results. The MeOH extract inhibited inflammation in vitro to 85-90% as measured by HRBC stabilization method; in vivo assessment as measured by the paw edema method revealed 40-45% inhibition of inflammation after/upto/at 6 hrs, compared to 50.04% for the standard (Gadamsetti et al., 2013a). Further work on the D. molunduana, D. sepiaria and the respective compounds regarding toxicity is recommended. This study requires the positive controls for comparative efficacy.  3.3.10. Antioxidant activity The combined ethanol (EtOH) extracts of stem and leaves and additional extracts from petroleum ether, EtOAc, butanol and water of D. hainanensis displayed an IC50 of 77.3, 115.2, 51.4, 342.9, and 205.7 μg/mL as measured by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 11,712.2, 10,820.9, 14,386.4, 1,157.6, and 5,584.1 μmol Fe2+/g as measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method. Results indicate moderate antioxidant activity when compared to ascorbic acid and BHT showing an IC50 of 10.7 μg/mL, 47.1 μg/mL for DPPH and 18,022.8 14 568.7 μmol Fe2+/g for FRAP method (Chen et al., 2011). As well, the petroleum ether, DCM, EtOAc and MeOH extracts of D. perreticulata possess moderate antioxidant activity (Chen et al., 2012). The petroleum ether, EtOAc, MeOH and aqueous extracts obtained from D. sepiaria leaves were assessed with an in vitro antioxidant method. The MeOH and EtOAc extracts provided the most potent and concentration dependent DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 95.43 μg/mL and 94.1 μg/mL respectively, compared to the ascorbic acid standard of 3.6 μg/mL; the same extracts also had the most potent and concentration dependent 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation decolourisation activity with IC50 values of 67.05 μg/mL and 55.25 μg/mL respectively, compared to the standard gallic acid with IC50 of 8.7 μg/mL (Gadamsetti et al., 2013a). Chinmaya et al. (2009) 41  reported the antioxidant activity of a MeOH extract of D. roxburghii measured by the DPPH method at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL concentrations exhibited high free radical scavenging activity in a dose dependent manner with 73 and 88.19% respectively, compared to ascorbic acid (95.04 and 97.30% respectively). Antiradical activity of the ethyl acetate extract of D. roxburghii stems was confirmed by a decrease in absorbance at 517 nm using the DPPH method. The extract exhibited high activity (91.9% inhibition with IC50 4 µg) compared to gallic acid (94.3% inhibition with IC50 2 µg), ascorbic acid (92.6% inhibition with IC50 3 µg), and quercetin (87.3% inhibition with IC50 5 µg). The extract showed high antioxidant activity when measured by the FRAP method with 638.7 equivalent to FeSO4.7H2O (µM), and displayed a higher absorbance of 1.393 at 695 nm for antioxidant capacity (TAC), compared to gallic acid with an absorbance of 1.213 (Shahwar et al., 2012). The combined extracts of dried D. roxburghii leaves and stems displayed significant DPPH and H2O2 free radical scavenging activity in a dose dependant manner, and was only marginally lower when compared to the ascorbic acid standard (Rajahamsa et al., 2013). 3.3.11. Antiviral activity In a preliminary study the MeOH extract of D. littoralis was found to possess activity against Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase (Lin et al., 2001). 3.3.12. DNAse and RNAse inhibition in vitro A multifunctional ~12 kDa heterodimeric protein named putrin isolated from the seeds of D. roxburghii was purified, characterised and cloned. Putrin  inhibited the protein synthesis with an IC50 of 6.6 μM and demonstrated a much lower cell-free translational inhibitory activity as compared with other 2S proteins and small RIPs (Tomar et al., 2014). 3.3.13. Bovin trypsin inhibition in vitro A highly stable trypsin inhibitor was isolated from the seeds of D. roxburghii. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 34 kDa and inhibits bovine trypsin in a 1:1 molar ratio (Chaudhary et al., 2008) 3.3.14. Acetylcholinesterase inhibition in vitro N-β-glucopyranosyl-p-hydroxyphenylacetamide 117, showed moderate activity against acetylcholinesterase with IC50 78.1 µM compared to galanthamine with 0.9 µM (Matochko, 2010;  Ata et al., 2011). 3.3.15. Antiemetic.activity in vivo An aqueous extracts of D. roxburghii administered at 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg, displayed a significant, dose-deprendent retching reduction in copper sulfate (CuSO4)-induced emesis in four days old chicks (61.7, 67.6, 70.8, and 78.9%, respectively) (Mughal and Mahboob, 2013). 3.3.16. Insecticidal  activity in vitro 42  The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and DCM extracts of the bark of D. gossweileri were found to be effective against the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais and the grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica at 1.0, 0.5, 0.250 g/10 mL (Aba et al., 2013). The seed kernel oil of D. roxburghii showed 100% repellency against the Indian seed storage insect Bruchus pisorum (Linn.), which was present in all 25 collected storage seed samples of Dalbergia sissoo Roxb, at a concentration of 0.02 mL (Kumar, 2014b). Volatile constituents extracted in the form of essential oil from D. roxburghii were found to protect againsts the insect Trogoderma granarium isolated from stored peanut seeds. This oil protected the peanut seeds completely for six months at 0.25 and 0.38 mL in 250 mL containers holding 200 g of seeds, and did not exhibit any adverse effects on seed germination, seedling growth as well as the general health and morphology of the plants (Tripathi and Kumar, 2007).  3.3.17. Anthelmintic activity in vitro The anthelmintic activity of EtOAc, MeOH and aqueous crude extracts of leaves on the Indian adult earthworm, Pheretima posthuma was reported by Gadamsetty et al. (2013b). All D. sepiaria extracts tested exhibited concentration-dependent activity of 10-80 mg/mL. The aqueous extract was significantly active causing paralysis after 72.2 min at 20 mg/mL, 42.3 min at 40 mg/mL, 12.6 min at 60 mg/mL and 8.3 min at 80 mg/mL; death occured after 148.5 min at 20 mg/mL, 101.3 min at 40 mg/mL, 30.7 min at 60 mg/mL and 14.0 min at 80 mg/mL. For comparison, 10 mg/mL of the standard reference drug, piperazine citrate, showed paralysis after 23.4 min and death after 63.2 min. 3.3.18. Toxicity The stem bark and seed extracts of  D. roxburghii revealed significant toxicity in the Artemia salina lethality assay, with LD50 values of 1.175 µg/mL and LC50 427.74 µg/mL, respectively (Krishnaraju et al., 2005, Raghavendra et al., 2010). The 70 % v/v MeOH extract of dried D. roxburghii leaves and stems showed acute toxicity (LD50 500 mg/kg) in female Wistar albino rats following oral adminsitration (Rajahamsa et al., 2013). Awasthy et al. (2000) reported the effects of orally administered D. roxburghii leaf extract to young weaning Swiss albino mice at 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg /day for seven consecutive days. The results demonstrated that the leaf extract induced significant mitosis-disruptive chromosomal changes in bone marrow cells, although there were no changes in the incidence of structural abnormalities among metaphase chromosomes. It was proposed that the extract might have interferred with the spindle and other related proteins causing polyploidy, aneuploidy, c-mitosis, etc. Single oral doses (4 -12 g/kg) of D. gossweileri stem bark extracts of produced acute toxicity in rats, but did not result in mortality or significant behavioural and biochemical changes. In subacute toxicological studies with both male and female rats, orally administered bark extract (48 hourly dosing of 500 mg/kg or 1000 g/kg for 4 weeks) did not cause any changes in biochemical or haematological parameters. There were no indicators of toxicity in terms of feeding or body weight alterations, with the exception of 1000 mg/kg dosed male rats 43  observed to have slightly decreased body weight. Morphological examination of various organs and fluctuations in their relative weights revealed no differences between control groups (treated with distilled water or maize oil) and treated rats (Ngouana et al., 2010). Moreover, no toxic effect was noticed in male and female albino Wistar rats treated per os with the crude stem bark extract at a dose up to 12 g/kg of body weight (Ngouana et al., 2011).   3.4.  Correlation of traditional medicinal use with bioactivity of crude extracts and isolated compounds  Traditional medicinal use of D. chevalieri, D. gerrardii, D. gossweileri, D. natalensis as well as D. roxburghii showed a clear correlation with significant bioactivities found in vivo and/or in vitro against malaria, cancers, pain, and rheumatism (table 3). Therefore, chemical and pharmacological investigation of other African traditional medicinal species is recommended for the following parts of plant which are preferrently applied for medicinal preparations. Among the 19 Drypetes species studied, only 5 were biologically tested according to the traditional uses of the plant. This may be due to the lack of appropriate equipment for biological tests or because the plants were studied separately by a chemist, a pharmacologist or a biologist. This is why the interdisciplinary approach (biologist, phytochemists and pharmacologist) should be followed, to conduct a comprehensive research work on any species.

Conclusions  The genus Drypetes has been used in the Subsaharan African and Asian traditional medicines to treat a multitude of disorders, like microbial infections, malaria, inflammation, tumours, as well as for the treatment of wounds, headache, and urethral problems. Some Drypetes species are used to protect food against pests, as an aphrodisiac, a stimulant/depressant, a rodenticide and a fish poison, against insect bites, to induce conception and for general healing. From 19 Drypetes species, a total of 142 different compounds belonging to more than 10 classes of natural compounds, including triterpenoids (76) (friedelane (35), oleanane (22), lupine (16) and hopane-type (3)), sesquiterpenoids (11), dinorditerpenoids (10), phenylpropanoid-phenylethanoid (9), lignans (8), steroids (7), flavonoids (6),  xanthone (1), anthraquinone (1) as well as some thiocyanates (5) and other metabolites (8), had been isolated. Triterpenoids, especially the friedelane derivatives were the only class of compound isolated in all 19 species. 10 pimarane dinorditerpenoids were isolated from the species collected in Asia D. littoralis (Taiwan), D. perreticulata (China), and in Africa D. gerrardii (Kenya), D. gossweileri (Cameroon). These compounds with aromatic ring C were exclusively isolated from this genus and might turn out to be good candidates for chemotaxonomic markers. Several crude extracts of these plants, and isolated compounds displayed significant analgesic, anthelmintic, antidiabetic, anti-emetic anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, central nervous system depressant, cytotoxic, and insecticidal activities both in vitro and in vivo. But, concerning the safety of traditional medicines derived from Drypetes, it should be noted that some crude extracts showed significant toxicity in Artemia salina model and in female Wistar albino rat, in addition, some extracts induced mitosis-disruptive chromosomal changes in the bone marrow cells of Swiss albino mice. Moreover, the flavonoid amentoflavone (128) reported from the extracts of genus Drypetes showed high toxicity against L-1-rat skeletal myoblast cells. Most of the Drypetes genus used in tradional medicine has never been investigated for their toxicity; therefore, doses given by the traditional healers might result in increased health problems or even death. As a consequence, traditional medicine from this genus should in future be applied with care. Further toxicological studies on the genus are urgently needed to improve their safety in traditional medicinal applications. Nevertheless, it is suggested that 45  dinorditerpenoids might play an important biologic role within the genus Drypetes. These compounds displayed very significant antimalarial activity in vitro against chloroquine-resistant African Plasmodium falciparum NF54 with IC50 of 0.9 μM, as well as significant cytotoxic activity against the leukemia cell line HL60 with IC50 of 1.95-1.37 µM. Further bioactivity testing of these compounds is recommended. Among the 19 Drypetes species, only D. chevalieri, D. gerrardii, D. gossweileri, D. natalensis as well as D. roxburghii showed a clear correlation with significant bioactivities found in vivo and/or in vitro against malaria, cancers, pain, and rheumatism. This may be due to the lack of appropriate equipment for biological tests in Africa and in Asia or because the plants were studied separately by a chemist, a pharmacologist or a biologist. It’s why the interdisciplinary approach is recommend (biologist, phytochemists and pharmacologist) to conduct a comprehensive bioassay-guided fractionation of not yet examined species.
