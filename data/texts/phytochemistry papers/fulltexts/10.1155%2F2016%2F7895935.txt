Hirudo (Shuizhi in Chinese) is an important Chinese medicine, which possesses many therapeutic properties for the treatment of
the cerebral hemorrhage and other thrombosis-related diseases. The phytochemical investigation gave more than 51 compounds
including pteridines, phosphatidylcholines, glycosphingolipids, and sterols, as well as some bioactive peptides from the Shuizhi
derived from three animal species recorded in the current Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The pharmacological studies on the Shuizhi
have revealed various activities such as anticoagulation, antithrombosis, antiatherosclerosis, antiplatelet aggregation, antitumor
and anti-inflammatory as well as hemorheology improvement, and protective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
However, some important issues based on the traditional uses of Shuizhi are still not clear. The aim of the present review is to
provide comprehensive knowledge on the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of Shuizhi. It will
provide a potential guidance in exploring main active compounds of Shuizhi and interpreting the actionmechanism for the further
research.
1. Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CDs) are the leading cause of death
worldwide [1]. They resulted in over 17.3 million deaths
(31.5%) in 2013 [2]. The pathological thrombus formation is
responsible for most of CDs such as myocardial infarction
and strokes. Compared with the synthetic drugs, Traditional
Chinese Medicines (TCMs) have been evidenced to be
active in the prevention and treatment of thrombosis-related
diseases with few side effects. Hirudo, a representative of
animal-sourced TCMs, also known as Chinese medicinal
leech (Shuizhi in Chinese), is featured on promoting blood
circulation and removing blood stasis. It was firstly recorded
in the Shen-Nong-Ben-Cao-Jing and had been widely used for
the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic
diseases [3]. More than 300 prescriptions containing Shuizhi
have been used in the clinical practice for 2000 years [4] and
there are hundreds of manufacturers making single Shuizhi
or its formula preparations in China [5]. Since 1963, Shuizhi
has been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [6].
Hirudotherapy was once popular in Europe, especially
during the 1825 and 1850, owing to the excluded effect
on treating various human diseases [7]. For several years,
there has been renewed interest in the use of medicinal
leeches, especially for reducing blood coagulation, relieving
venous pressure from pooling blood, and treating congestive
complications after plastic and reconstructive surgery [8, 9].
Widespread recognition and acceptance of leech usagewithin
the medical community came in 2004 when the US Food and
Drug Administration officially approved the marketing and
sale of the medicinal leech as a medical device for relieving
venous congestion [10, 11]. 650 species of leeches are found all
over the world andHirudo medicinalis is a kind of leechmed-
ically used in the western countries [9]. However, according

to the description in the Chinese traditional literatures, only
several species, with the features of small body, living inwater,
and blood-sucking, are possible sources of Shuizhi, such asH.
nipponiaWhitman (HN),H. pulchra Song, Poecilobdella nan-
jingensis sp. Nov., P. manillensis (Lesson), and P. hubeiensis
Yang [12].Three species includingWhitmania pigraWhitman
(WP), H. nipponica Whitman, and W. acranulata Whitman
(WA) are recorded in the current Chinese Pharmacopoeia
as the source of Shuizhi [13]. Among them, WP is the most
commonly available from Chinese commercial leech market.
Based on the potent anticoagulant effect of Shuizhi, many
investigations on phytochemistry and biological activities
have been reported. The present review summarized the
ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacological
properties of Shuizhi, concerning three legally listed Chinese
species, which can provide some evidences for the interpre-
tation of its effective constituents and action mechanism.
2. Ethnopharmacology
The earliest record of Shuizhi appeared in the first classic
book on Chinese Materia Medica, Shen-Nong-Ben-Cao-Jing
as a downgrade drug. The debate on the animal origins of
Shuizhi has been continued in the follow-up Chinesemedical
classicsMing-Yi-Bie-Lu (206 BC–8AD),Ben-Cao-Jing-Ji-Zhu
(480–498 AD), Xin-Xiu-Ben-Cao (657–659 AD), Shu-Ben-
Cao (935–960 AD), Ben-Cao-Tu-Jing (1020–1101 AD), Ben-
Cao-Meng-Quan (1565 AD), and Ben-Cao-Gang-Mu (1590
AD). As an important TCM characterized by eliminating
blood stasis and stimulating menstruation discharge, the
Chinese Pharmacopoeia has officially accepted it since 1963,
for the treatment of amenorrhea induced by blood stasis,
masses in the abdomen, apoplexy, and hemiplegic paralysis
as well as traumatic injuries.
Shuizhi is often used in combination with other TCM
ingredients to treat ailments resulting from blood stasis.
Based on the textual literatures, more than 300 prescrip-
tions containing Shuizhi have been described in the clinical
practice, including the different dosage forms such as pill,
decoction, powder, sublimed preparation, and plaster. The
famous “Di-Dang decoction or pill” and “Da-Huang-Zhe-
Chongpill” arewell employed bymedical sage, ZhangZhong-
jing, living in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD). In the
mentioned prescriptions, there are up to 290 TCMs being
compatible with Shuizhi, among which, the top ten drugs are
Tabanus (Mengchong), Persicae Semen (Taoren), Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (Dahuang), Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui),
Cinnamomi Cortex (Rougui), Moutan Cortex (Mudanpi),
Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix (Niuxi), Ginseng Radix et Rhi-
zoma (Renshen), Natrii Sulfas (Mangxiao), and Toxicodendri
Resina (Ganqi) (Table S1, in SupplementaryMaterial available
online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/7895935). The herbal
couple of Hirudo (Shuizhi) and Tabanus (Mengchong) is the
most common unit in the prescription compositions.
According to recorded formula compositions and clin-
ical evidences, most of these prescriptions have been sub-
jected to modern drug research and development. As a
result, to date, there are hundreds of patented prepara-
tions officially approved to the medical market in China,
containing single Shuizhi or its compatibility form with
other herbs (Table S2) [5, 13, 14]. The representatives of
frequently prescribed preparations are Nao-Xue-Kang, Huo-
Xue-Tong-Mai Capsule, and Tong-Xin-Luo Capsule. The
former two are derived from single Shuizhi and the latter is
prepared from eleven ingredients: Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma
(Renshen), Hirudo (Shuizhi), Scorpio (Quanxie), Paeoniae
Radix Rubra (Chishao), Cicadae Periostracum (Chantui),
Eupolyphaga (Tubiechong), Scolopendra (Wugong), San-
tali Albi Lignum (Tanxiang), Dalbergiae Odoriferae Lignum
(Jiangxiang), Olibanum (Ruxiang, processed with vinegar),
Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (Suanzaoren, fried), and Borneolum
Syntheticum (Bingpian).
3. Chemical Constituents
The enormous information gathered from the ethnopharma-
cological applications of Shuizhi and its preparations needs
the global investigation of the chemical constituents. These
studies have led to the isolation of macromolecule substances
such as protein and polypeptide and small molecules includ-
ing pteridines, phosphatidylcholines, glycosphingolipids, and
sterols.
3.1. Proteins and Peptides
3.1.1. Hirudin and Recombinant Products. As the represen-
tative of active proteins and peptides from Shuizhi, hirudin
has been considered as the most potent natural inhibitor
of thrombin for a long time. Hirudin is an active peptide
isolated from the saliva of H. medicinalis by Marquanrdt
of Germany in 1950 and it is composed of 65 amino acids
with themolecularweight of approximately 7.1 kDa, including
a compact N-terminal domain containing three S-S bonds
and a C-terminal domain that is disordered in uncomplexed
hirudin [15]. Natural hirudin presents inminuscule amounts,
and it is not enough to obtain hirudin as an antithrombotic
agent for considerable clinical use. Therefore, recombinant
techniques are used to produce homogeneous preparations
of hirudin. In a successful case, the recombinant RGD-
hirudin containing a recognizable sequence of Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) is a bifunctional molecule according to the structure
of wild-type hirudin variant 2. These structural changes
improve the hydrophobicity of the protein and allow the
recombinant RGD-hirudin to interact more effectively with
the fibrinogen recognition exosite of thrombin, resulting
in a specific activity of 12,000ATU/mg [16]. Owing to the
significant anticoagulant effects [17, 18], recombinant hirudin
has been approved into the market for the treatment of
thrombosis-related diseases.
Hirudin naturally occurs in the fresh saliva of medicinal
leeches, and it is almost not detected in the processed Shuizhi
samples. Moreover, hirudin is easily degraded when orally
administrated by the pepsin secreted from gastric chief cells.
However, according to the traditional uses, Shuizhi was
commonly decocted in hot water for 1-2 h and orally adminis-
trated in the clinical practice, resulting in the good anticoag-
ulant effect [19]. The evidences from the comparative study
of different extracting methods also suggested the extracts
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3
produced by water-boiling and alcohol-precipitating showed
the strongest anticoagulant activity and good antithrombotic
effect [20]. These clues led to more investigations for discov-
ering other potent substances from Shuizhi.
3.1.2. Other Peptides. Recent studies reported novel proteins
or peptides with anticoagulant activity from Shuizhi related
animal origin species. NLP-1 (New Leech Protein-1), a low-
abundant protein (Mw 13800Da), was obtained from HN on
the basis of biomimetic ligand library screening and one-step
purification method [21]. Recently, three peptides were also
identified fromdried body ofHNwith theirmolecular weight
separately 14998, 15988, and 15956Da by ultra-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector [22].
Using the same methods, an oligopeptide with a much lower
molecular weight of 1997.1 Da, whitide, was obtained from
dried WP, and it might be an oral anticoagulant for its hot
and trypsin stability [23]. A novel anticoagulant peptide,
whitmanin, was isolated and purified from the dried body
of WP by anion-exchange chromatography on Sephadex
DEAE A-50, gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex
G-25 and Sephadex LH-20 columns, and reversed phase high
performance liquid chromatography successively [24, 25].
3.2. Small Molecule Constituents. Apart from the macro-
molecules, small molecule constituents are considered as
potent active substances, including pteridines, phosphatidyl-
cholines, glycosphingolipids, sterols, and fat acids.
3.2.1. Pteridines. Two new heterocyclics, hirudonucleodisul-
fide A 1 and hirudonucleodisulfide B 2, were isolated from
the dried material of WP, displaying the moderate antianoxic
activity with EC
50
values of 27.01 ± 2.23 𝜇g/mL and 19.54 ±
1.53 𝜇g/mL, respectively [26]. The same authors’ continual
investigation on WP reports the isolation and structural
elucidation of a new pteridinedione 3 [27]. From the same
species, three new pteridine derivatives, 4–6, and a new
𝛼-pyrone glycoside 7, with novel structural features, were
publicated recently [28, 29]. Interestingly, the phytochemical
study onHN, another legally listed species, also afforded three
new pteridines, hirudinoidines A 8, B 9, and C 10 [30], which
suggested both species shared the same compound type. The
structures of compounds 1–10 are presented in Figure 1.
3.2.2. Phosphatidylcholines and Glycosphingolipids. Nine
lysoglycerophospholipids 11–19 were isolated from the
dried body of HN [31]. Among them, two (15 and 18) are
lysophosphatidylcholines and the other seven are lyso-
platelet-activating factors. Eight new glycosphingolipids
20–27, along with four known ones, 28–31, were also
obtained from this species, including six zwitterionic
monogalactosylceramides carrying a choline phosphate
group, 20-21 and 28–31, and six neutral trigalactosylceram-
ides 22–27 [32, 33]. The structures of compounds 11–31 are
presented in Figure 2.
3.2.3. Other Components. Eight known compounds have
been reported for the first time from HN collected
from Jiangsu province, China, including campesterol
32, hexadecyl ether of glycerol 33, (2S,3S,4E)-4,5-didehydro-
octadecasphingosine pentacosanoic amide 34, 1-O-(𝛽-D-gal-
actopyranosyloxy)-substituted-2-(docosenoylamino)octa-
dec-4-en-3-ol 35, succinic acid 36, hypoxanthine 37,
propylamine 38, and L-isoleucine 39 [34]. In addition to
the compounds 32, 33, and 36–39, other 12 first-reported
constituents are obtained from commercial samples of HN,
including cholesterol 40, nicotinic acid 41, uracil 42, uridine
43, inosine 44, xanthine 45, phenylalanine 46, adenosine
47, proline 48, valine 49, glycerin 50, and palmitic acid 51
[35]. Fatty acid methyl esters and sterols were identified by
GC-MS in the anticoagulant extract of WP [36].
4. Qualitative and Quantitative Analyses
Since the protein and amino acids are the major components
of Shuizhi, the amino acids targeted analysis on Shuizhi is
one of the main aspects in the quality control. A reversed
phase high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative
light scattering detectionmethodwas developed for the direct
determination of fourteen underivatized amino acids in the
samples ofWP, including serine, histidine, glycine, threonine,
arginine, alanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, valine,
phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine [37]. Compared
with direct determinationmethodwithout derivatization, the
indirect methods with derivatization of amino acid (pre- or
post-column derivatization) were commonly used for the
total amino acids and free amino acids in the dried Shuizhi
samples [38, 39]. For the small bionic zymolysis peptides,
Lorry method recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia was
more preferable than biuretmethod and ninhydrin colorime-
try method [40, 41]. Dot blotting was also employed for
the determination of hirudin’s hydrolysates in the processed
Shuizhi samples with rat antibody of anti-hirudin as the first
antibody, resulting in the concentration of 296.51, 165.47,
95.58, and 298.05 𝜇g/g [42]. The new anticoagulant peptide,
whitmanin, has the average concentration of 0.074% in the
different batches of commercial samples fromWP [43].
Nucleosides have been proven as the bioactive com-
pounds involved in the multiple biological activities such
as antiplatelet aggregation and antiarrhythmic and anti-
seizure effects [44]. Several quantitative studies have been
reported concerning the recently reported small molecule
compounds as marker constituents for the quality evaluation
of Shuizhi samples, including uracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine,
uridine, hirudonucleodisulfide C, hirudonucleodisulfide A,
and hirudonucleodisulfide B [45–50]. The content of uracil,
hypoxanthine, xanthine, uridine, hirudonucleodisulfide C,
hirudonucleodisulfide A, and hirudonucleodisulfide B in the
different batches of samples varies over the range of 0.063–
0.17%, 0.90–1.48%, 0.052–0.23%, 0.051–0.17%, 0.18–0.28%,
0.15–0.29%, and 0.12–.021%, respectively. The total amounts
are 2.12–2.41% [48]. The content of hirudonucleodisulfide C
was the highest and that of hirudonucleodisulfide B was the
lowest. In addition, the total amounts of three compounds
depended on the species and cultivating areas [49].
In terms of the ongoing debate on the undefined effective
substances of Shuizhi, the quality control using the chemical

markers displayed certain limitation. Therefore, the bioassay
has been paidmore attention to. Apart from the items includ-
ing description, TLC identification, tests (water content, total
ash, ash insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and pH value), and
ethanol soluble extractive, the antithrombin titrationmethod
for the quantitative assay was legally recorded in the current
quality standard of Shuizhi [13]. It contains not less than
16.0U of antithrombin per g for HN and 3.0U for WP and
WA. However, this quantitative method is not so objective
and it could lead to poor accuracy of the test results. Many
methods based on the biological activity were attempted
to improve the quality control strategy of Shuizhi, such
as fibrinogen-thrombin time (Fibg-TT) [51] and activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) [52–54].
5. Pharmacological Activities
As an important TCM to control cerebral hemorrhage
and other thrombosis-related diseases, Shuizhi showed
various pharmacological effects including anticoagulation,
antithrombosis, antiatherosclerosis, antiplatelet aggregation,
antitumor and anti-inflammatory as well as hemorheol-
ogy improvement, and protective effects against cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury. Of all the activities described
for Shuizhi, the anticoagulation and antithrombosis are the
most widely studied subject to date. In terms of traditional
uses, we provide a general overview of main bioactivity of
Shuizhi extract, powder, ormicropowder.The progress on the
pharmacological activity of hirudin is beyond the scope of
this paper.
5.1. Effect on the Hematological System
5.1.1. Anticoagulation. Numerous studies have evidenced that
the anticoagulation is the main pharmaceutical effect of
Shuizhi [55]. However, the action intensity of anticoagulation
is affected by many factors such as origin species [56–58],
harvesting and postharvesting process [59–61], and prepara-
tion methods of tested samples [62, 63]. The Shuizhi samples
from blood-sucking HN displayed stronger anticoagulation
activity than those from snail or clam-feeding WP, and,
moreover, the fresh samples are more active than the dried

ones [56]. The extracts obtained by different extract solvents
and methods showed various anticoagulant activities. Pro-
thrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), and APTT were
employed as evaluation markers for the discovery of active
fractions of Shuizhi and, as a result, ethyl acetate fraction
remarkably prolonged PT, TT, and APTT [62]. Nonheating
leech extract could prolong bleeding time (BT) and clotting
time (CT) in the model mice and PT and APTT in the model
rats and decrease the activity of coagulation factor II and
platelet aggregation in the model rats [64]. Nonheating leech
extract produced stronger anticoagulant effect on the mice
with blood hypercoagulable state than water-decocted leech
extract [65]. Altogether, the different species, habitat, harvest
time, extraction methods, and drying process would result
in the different quality of Shuizhi with variable anticoagulant
activity.
Most of published literatures report that the anticoagu-
lation mechanism of Shuizhi is related to hirudin. However,
hirudin level is very low in the processed Shuizhi samples,
even almost not detected. The increasing evidence indicates
that other small molecules may be attributed to the whole
anticoagulation effect. Therefore, more efforts are to be made
for understanding its action mechanism.
5.1.2. Antithrombosis Effect. The antithrombosis effect shares
part of the endogenous or exogenous signal pathways with
anticoagulation. Besides anticoagulation, Shuizhi showed
potent antithrombosis effect. The ethanol extract from
Shuizhi significantly inhibited the thrombosis induced by
collagen-adrenaline in the mice and thrombosis in artery-
vein bypass in the rats. This effect may be associated with
the enhancement of erythrocyte and thrombocytemembrane
fluidity [66, 67]. The water-soluble extract of Shuizhi signifi-
cantly activated tissue factor pathway inhibitors and inhibited
overexpression of tissue factors in the HUVECs induced by
thrombin [68].
5.1.3. Effect onHemorheology. Shuizhiwater-decocted extract
can decrease blood viscosity and plasma viscosity of rats or
human and shorten the electrophoresis time of erythrocyte
[69]. The active extracts of Shuizhi can significantly improve
hemorheological parameters of the acute blood stasis rats
[70]. Shuizhi micropowder can improve blood rheology of
rats with acute blood stasis and possess obvious effect of
promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Its
action mechanism might be related to the content decrease
of plasma von Willebrand factor and plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 [71].
5.1.4. Antiatherosclerosis Effect. Atherosclerosis is a main
event and fundament of many cardiovascular diseases and
it has now been considered as a chronic inflammatory
disease. Shuizhi extract from WP can obviously attenuate
the area of atherosclerosis lesion in ApoE−/− mice in a
dose-dependent manner, and this effect is mainly a result of
reduced invasion ofmonocyte in arterywalls by blockingNF-
𝜅B translocation [72]. Shuizhi powder may be involved in the
decrease of plasma total cholesterol level and inflammatory
factor, further inhibition on the proliferation of smooth
muscle cells in the atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E
deficient mice [73]. Shuizhi extract at the dosage of 3, 15, and
75mg/kg decreased significantly the content of plasma total
cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol
and nitric oxide, and activities of serum NOS and iNOS and
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7
increased activities of serum cNOS in hyperlipidemia rats
[74]. An experiment carried out in blood stasis syndrome
rabbits further confirmed that Shuizhi could regulate lipid
metabolism, which is related to increasing LDL-R and ApoE
mRNA expression [75]. Liu and Sui have drawn similar
conclusion that Shuizhi superfine powder played a role in
antagonizing atherosclerosis by regulating level of serum
lipid [76]. Tongxinluo capsule, a compound preparation
containing Shuizhi as a main ingredient, has similar effects
as simvastatin in lowering serum lipid levels, inhibiting
plaque inflammation, and preventing vulnerable plaques
from rupture and may provide an alternative therapy for
atherosclerosis [77]. Dahuang Zhechong pill, a famous and
classical Chinese herbal prescription containing Shuizhi,
significantly inhibited the proliferation of vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) in vivo and in vitro. The inhibitory
effect is partially attributed to depressing PDGF expression
in VSMCs, retarding the cell cycle and promoting apoptosis
ofVSMCs [78]. Reversion of vascular endothelial dysfunction
is another important mechanism of antiatherosclerotic effect
of Shuizhi [79].
5.2. Protective Effect against Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion
Injury. As an important ingredient in the clinical pre-
scriptions for cerebral hemorrhage, anticoagulation cannot
fully explain the efficacy of Shuizhi. The cerebral ischemia-
reperfusion injury was characterized by the injury, apoptosis,
and necrosis of nerve cells. The Shuizhi extract obtained
by water decoction and ethanol precipitation significantly
protected cerebral cells from apoptosis in middle cerebral
artery ischemia/reperfusion rats by reducing the apoptotic
rate of cerebral cells [80] and regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax pro-
tein [81]. Shuizhi micropowder also displayed the protective
effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing
SOD activity and decreasing MDA and NO contents in
the serum or cerebral tissues, as well as reducing the pro-
duction of inflammatory factors such as intercellular adhe-
sion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-
1 (VCAM-1), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
[82–84]. Similar mechanism was shown that Sheng-Nao-
Kang decoction (SNK) including Shuizhi as one of fifteen
TCM ingredients, a modified traditional Chinese medicine
for the treatment of acute and chronic cerebrovascular
related diseases, demonstrated a strong and ameliorative
effect on cerebral I/R damage in rats due to the properties
of antiapoptosis and antioxidation as well as regulation of
iNOS and TNOS [85]. In addition, the effect of Shuizhi on
cerebral hemorrhagemight be associatedwith the production
improvement of capillary cell and glial cells in rats [86].
Under the guidance of “Nao sui” theory proposed by Ren
Jixue, National Master of TCM, Poxue Huayu and Tianjing
Busui decoction, containing Shuizhi in combination with
other seven TCMs, was used for cerebral hemorrhage. Its
action mechanism is through upregulating the expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor [87].
5.3. Antitumor Effect. Shuizhi is the representative of TCMs
derived from animal insect sources, with the properties
of eliminating blood stasis, softening hard masses, and
dissolving lumps. The single Shuizhi or its formula prepa-
rations in combination with other TCM ingredients were
commonly used to treat various cancers in the clinical prac-
tice, including esophagus cancer, gastric carcinoma, intestinal
cancer, hysterocarcinoma, and breast cancer. The increasing
evidence indicated that Shuizhi could inhibit the proliferation
of human HepG2 [88, 89] and leukemic HL-60 cells [90].
The action mechanism could be involved in the induced
cell differentiation and apoptosis [88, 90, 91] and cell cycle
arrest in the G1 phase [92], as well as participation in
DNA demethylation by inhibiting the expression of DNA
methyltransfer [89, 93]. Downregulating the expression of
MDR1 and upregulating caspase 3 are considered to be pos-
sible mechanism of Shuizhi extract inducing apoptosis and
enhancing the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of 5-fluorouracil
and adriamycin in the Hep2 cell [94]. In addition, a recent
investigation suggested that Shuizhi could inhibit tumor
angiogenesis via improving tumor hypoxia microenviron-
ment, which was partly attributed to decreasing the expres-
sion of mRNA and protein level of hypoxia inducible factor-
1𝛼 (HIF-1𝛼), and degrade the mRNA expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), downstream gene of HIF-
1𝛼 [95, 96].
5.4. Anti-Inflammatory Effect. Shuizhi has displayed antico-
agulant, antithrombin, and hypolipidemic effect as well as
protective effect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
These effects could be attributed to its anti-inflammation and
detumescence. Earlier reports indicated that Shuizhi extract
fromWP at a dose of 2 g crude material/kg reduced abdomi-
nal capillary permeability in themice and relieved croton oil-
induced mouse ear edema and carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema and subcutaneous embedding of filter paper induced
granulation tissue hyperplasia in themice [97].Theprocessed
products showed a stronger anti-inflammatory trend than
that of crude materials [98].
6. Concluding Remarks and
Future Perspectives
As a valuable traditional medicine, the research on chemi-
cal compositions, pharmacological actions, and therapeutic
properties of Shuizhi has been ongoing in China, and, up
to now, great progress has been made; however, its active
substances and action mechanisms remain unclear.
6.1. Influence of Origin Species on the Chemical Difference
and Therapeutic Properties of Shuizhi. Of all three species
legally described in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, WP is the
richest resource and it has becomemainstream in theChinese
commercial Shuizhi market. However, compared with blood-
sucking HN, WP showed weaker anticoagulation effect and,
moreover, it is not in accordance with the description of
medicinal leech in the Chinese traditional textures [12].
For the multiorigin TCMs, each of different species dis-
played various pharmacological intensity, which is bound to
bring to the effectiveness difference in the clinical practice.
Therefore, the comprehensively systematic comparison of
the chemistry and pharmacology of three legally recorded
8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
species is necessary for the consistency of clinical efficacy of
commercially available Shuizhi.
6.2. The Debate on the Active Substances Is Ongoing and
Much Effort Is to Be Made. Most studies regarded hirudin
and its homologue peptides as active substances responsible
for its anticoagulation activity; however, in our opinion,
the following points support that more components are
attributed to the whole effect of Shuizhi. Hirudin is present
in the fresh saliva of HN and it is easily destroyed at high
temperature or by the pepsin. It is active in the direct
injection form. Traditionally, Shuizhi was commonly used in
the processed forms (calcining in the hot talcumpowder) and
decocted in the hot water before being orally administrated.
Therefore, based on the ancient tradition, it is not enough
to take hirudin as active substances for Shuizhi samples. The
studies on the active substances of Shuizhi and their action
mechanism are to be continued, employing the advanced
extraction, purification, and analytical technologies, includ-
ing proteomics for macromolecules and phytochemistry for
micromolecules as well as the integration of metabonomics,
network pharmacology, and chemoinformatics.
6.3.TheArt and Science of Processing for Shuizhi in the Clinical
Practice. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory,
paozhi processing transforms raw drugs into “decoction
pieces,” thus instilling them with the desired properties for
their medical application, including improved flavor and
detoxification or alteration of their therapeutic efficacy [99].
Based on the ancient tradition, it is necessary for Shuizhi to
be processed before prescribing, by calcining, or frying with
or without adjuvants. In the current Chinese Pharmacopoeia,
the only calcined Shuizhi in the hot talcum powder is
recorded. The studies indicated that processing at the high
temperature could decrease the anticoagulation activity of
Shuizhi or improve its anti-inflammatory activity [100]. How
to obtain the targeted therapeutic features by processing
is very important, which is associated with the different
factors such as tested samples, processing parameters, and
bioassay markers. More investigations are to be done for
understanding the scientific importance of processing of
Shuizhi for the clinical prescription and drug preparations
and further standardization of the processing techniques.
Generally speaking, the present review summarized the
traditional uses and phytochemistry and pharmacological
properties of Shuizhi. Some important unanswered questions
and directions for future research are outlined, which arouses
us to take more efforts to assure the safety and efficacy of
Shuizhi in the clinical practice.
