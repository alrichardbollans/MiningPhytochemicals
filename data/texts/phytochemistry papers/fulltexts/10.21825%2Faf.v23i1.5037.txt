Its fruit pulp has very high vitamin C content (~ ten times that of orange), and can be used in seasoning, as an appetizer and to make juices. Seeds contain appreciable quantities of crude protein, diges-tible carbohydrates and oil, whereas they have high levels of lysine, thiamine, Ca and Fe. They can be eaten fresh or dried, ground into flour and thus added to soups and stews. Processing eliminates a number of anti-nutritional factors present in the seed. Baobab leaves are superior in nutritional quality to fruit pulp, and contain significant levels of vitamin A. The leaves are a staple for many populations in Africa, and are eaten fresh or dried. Several plant parts have interesting anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and baobab has been used extensively since an-cient times in traditional medicine. Key words: Baobab, Adansonia digitata L., traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacology, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, anti-nutritional factors  IntroductionBaobab or Adansonia digitata L. belongs to the Malvaceae family (Bremer et al., 2003) and is a deciduous tree native to arid Central Africa (Yazzie et al., 1994). Its distribution area is large and this species can be found in most of Sub-Sahara Africa’s semi-arid and sub-humid regions as well as in western Madagascar (Diop et al., 2005). It has been intro-duced to areas outside Africa and grown successfully (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Baobab is a very long-lived tree with multipurpose uses. The different plant parts are widely used as foods, medicines and the bark fibres are also used (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). The tree provides food, shelter, clothing and medicine as well as material for hunting and fishing (Venter & Venter (1996) cited in Gebauer et al., 2002). Every part of the baobab tree is re-ported to be useful (Owen (1970) cited in Igboeli et al., 1997 and Gebauer et al., 2002).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 12 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van damme Objectives and MethodologyMany authors have published about the multipurpose baobab tree. Nevertheless, only a few of these authors have presented a (general) literature review, and none of these dealt simply and solely with the nutritional and medicinal value of baobab products. For that reason, we decided to collect, document and compare detailed data on traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology for fruit pulp, seeds, leaves and flowers, and bark of the baobab tree. The literature search was done by using the following search terms: ‘baobab’ and ‘Adansonia digitata’. The authors included, without time limitation, all available informa-tion as proposed on Web of Science, consisting of different databases containing infor-mation gathered from thousands of scholarly journals, books, book series, reports and conferences. As is conventional in ethnobotanical reviews, authors respected original definitions, descriptions and/or naming of diseases and afflictions. However, we are fully aware that this leaves sometimes doubt on the exact nature (i.e. disease names as known in formal western medicine) but consider the latter equations to be outside of the scope of this article. During our literature review, a large variation in information and data was encoun-tered and the reported values were, as much as possible, converted into the same unit. Authors are thus aware that there might be discrepancies in analytical data presented in some tables (e.g. Table V and Table X). It should be understood however, that each laboratory or research group uses specific analytical tools and that it is impossible to streamline results in such a way that they could be compared using the same standard. The reader is referred to the original articles for details about analytical methods and cor-rect interpretation of the results obtained. Food Uses FruitsThe baobab fruit pulp is probably the most important foodstuff. It can be dissolved in water or milk. The liquid is then used as a drink, a sauce for food, a fermenting agent in local brewing, or as a substitute for cream of tartar in baking (Sidibe & Williams, 2002) (Figure 1). afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 13 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyFigure 1. Preparation of baobab fruit pulp porridge: (1-2-3) pulp, seeds and fibres are diluted in water; (4) seeds and fibres are removed (4a) and dissolved pulp remains (4b); (5-6-7) at the same time, water is added to e.g. maize flour, boiled and thickened to a porridge which is mixed with the dissolved baobab pulp (Source: Emmy De Caluwé, Benin, 2004).The pulp has recently become a popular ingredient in ice products in urban areas (Scheuring et al., 1999; Sidibe et al. (1998b) cited in Gebauer et al., 2002), in different kinds of juices and jams (Figure 2). The pulp is never cooked as the hot drinks are be-ing prepared, rather it is added at the end of the preparation process after the drinks are allowed to cool (Sidibe et al., 1996). Fruit pulp is important in local diets as a seasoning component and appetizer (Burkill (1985) cited in Ajayi et al., 2003). When the pulp is soaked in water, it produces a milky solution, which can be consumed as a milk substi-tute (Burkill (1985) cited in Ajayi et al., 2003). The baobab fruit pods are also good for burning and a potash-rich vegetable salt may be obtained from this ash for making soap (Burkill (1985) cited in Ajayi et al., 2003).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 14 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeFigure 2. From left to right: baobab nectar, two different kinds of baobab syrup and two different kinds of baobab jam (Source: Emmy De Caluwé). SeedsBaobab seeds can be eaten fresh, or they may be dried and ground into a flour which can either be added to soups and stews as a thickener, or roasted and ground into a paste, or boiled for a long time, fermented and then dried for use (Sidibe & Williams, 2002; FAO (1988) cited in Nnam & Obiakor, 2003) (Figure 3).Figure 3.

LeavesThe leaves of the baobab tree are a staple for many populations in Africa, especially the central region of the continent (Yazzie et al., 1994; Gebauer et al., 2002). During the rainy season when the baobab leaves are tender, people harvest the leaves fresh. Dur-ing the last month of the rainy season, leaves are harvested in great abundance and are dried for domestic use and for marketing during the dry season. The leaves are typically sun-dried and either stored as whole leaved or pounded and sieved into a fine powder (Sidibe et al. (1998b) cited in Gebauer et al., 2002) (Figure 4). Young leaves are widely used, cooked as spinach, and frequently dried, often powdered and used for sauces over porridges, thick gruels of grains, or boiled rice (Sidibe & Williams, 2002).afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 15 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyFigure 4.

PhytochemistryIn general and regardless the variation in reported data, one can conclude that baobab pulp is rich in vitamin C, the leaves are rich in good quality proteins – most essen-tial amino acids are present in the leaves – and minerals, and the seeds in fat. Moreover, pulp and leaves exhibit antioxidant activity (Chadare et al., 2009). A variety of chemicals have been isolated and characterised from A. digitata. They belong to the classes of ter-penoids, flavonoids, steroids, vitamins, amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (Shukla et al., 2001). Literature review revealed a great variation in reported values of nutrient contents of baobab part. According to Chadare et al. (2009), the causes of these varia-tions are not well known, however they made several assumptions. The variation may be due to the quality of the sample, the provenance of the sample, the age of the sample, the treatment before analysis, the storage conditions, the processing methods, a probable genetic variation, and the soil structure and its chemical composition. Apart from the variability in the material, the analytical methods and inherent variability may also be a cause of variability. Moreover, some of the micronutrients, such as vitamins and miner-als, are biologically active. They can interact with other nutrients and change in their bio-availability. Chadare et al. (2009) give a critical evaluation of similarities and divergences of the values in relation to the research methods used. Based on this variation, Chadare et al. (2009) made three recommendations for future research: (1) more attention should be given to accuracy and precision of analytical methods; (2) research about digestibility and bioavailability of baobab products is needed; and (3) the effect of storage and processing on the nutritional value of baobab products needs to be assessed.  Fruits The baobab fruit is composed of an outer shell (epicarp) (45%), fruit pulp (15%) and seeds (40%) (Shukla et al., 2001). The woody epicarp or pod contains the internal fruit pulp (endocarp) which is split in small floury, dehydrated and powdery slides that afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 16 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeenclose multiple seeds and filaments, the red fibres, that subdivide the pulp in segments (Nour et al. (1980) cited in Besco et al., 2007) (Figure 5). Figure 5. Baobab fruit (Source: Emmy De Caluwé, Benin, 2004). Fruit Pulp The dry baobab fruit pulp has a slightly tart, refreshing taste and is very nutritious, with particularly high values for carbohydrates, energy, calcium, potassium (very high), thiamine, nicotinic acid and vitamin C (very high) (Arnold et al., 1985). The baobab fruit pulp is dry, acidulous and mealy, and rich in mucilage, pectins, tartarate and free tartaric acids. The presence of the tartarate gives rise to the name ‘cream of tartar tree’ (Sidibe & Williams, 2002; Wickens (1982) cited in Ajayi et al., 2003). Pulp sweetness is provided by fructose, saccharose and glucose contents. Fruit pulp is also acidic and this is due to the presence of organic acids including citric, tartaric, malic, succinic as well as ascorbic acid (Airan & Desai (1954) cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002). When eaten raw, the pulp is a rich source of calcium and vitamins B and C (Burkill (1985) cited in Ajayi et al., 2003). It contains sugars but no starch, and is rich in pectins. The fruit pulp has a very high vi-tamin C content, almost ten times that of oranges. However, the vitamin C content of the bulk fruit pulp reportedly varies from 1623 mg/kg in one tree to 4991 mg/kg in another (Sidibe et al., 1996; Sidibe et al. (1998a) cited in Gebauer et al., 2002). Chemical CompositionThe pulp is acidic, due to the presence of the organic acids citric, tartaric, malic, succinic and ascorbic, with pH 3.3 (Nour et al., 1980). The latter source also shows that the pulp is rich in pectin (average 56.2%). The pectin is mainly water soluble and has a low degree of esterification and a low intrinsic viscosity. This suggests that it will probably not yield a high quality jelly of high solids content, because it tends to precipitate rapidly afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 17 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyin acid media to form irregular gels. It is of lower quality than commercial apple pectin and citrus waste pectin (Mubarak et al. (1977) cited in Nour et al., 1980).The fruit pulp contains a high amount of carbohydrate, low protein, and extremely low fat (Osman, 2004). According to Murray et al. (2001), simple sugars in baobab pulp account for about 35.6% of the total carbohydrate content. This explains the noticeable sweet taste of the pulp. However, the sweetness may vary for different types of pulp (Chadare et al., 2009). The low water content, strong acidity and high sugar content was confirmed by Cisse et al. (2009). Proximate composition of the fruit pulp of baobab dif-fers according to different literature sources (Nour et al., 1980; Becker, 1983; Arnold et al., 1985; Obizoba & Amaechi, 1993; Saka & Msonthi, 1994; Odetokun, 1996; Lockett et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2001; Shukla et al., 2001; Osman, 2004) (Table I). Green (1932, cited in Nour et al., 1980) reported the absence of starch in the pulp, which was confirmed by Nour et al. (1980). Chadare et al. (2009) estimated the contribution of baobab pulp to the recommend-ed daily intake (RDI) for energy, carbohydrates and protein for children and pregnant women. The reported lowest and highest carbohydrate content of the pulp allows cover-age of 21.5% and 40.6% of the RDI when 60 g is consumed by a child. A consumption of 100 g pulp will cover 26 to 50% of the carbohydrate RDI for pregnant women. On the other hand, the energy content of the pulp is rather low when compared with the RDI for children and pregnant women. afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 18 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeConstituentABCDEFGHIJMoisture (%)-8.704.7025.856.7019.90-6.21-10.40Dry matter (%)85.50-----86.80-89.45-Protein2.502.702.501.802.60a15.303.1010.902.193.20Fat0.800.200.700.380.204.104.304.280.370.30Ash-5.805.103.315.301.905.001.985.714.50Crude fibre11.408.9045.10-5.70-8.306.2111.155.40Carbohydrate81.3073.7035.60b-23.20c58.8079.4045.2170.0376.20Metabolizable energy (kJ/100g)846.001292.00849.00---1480.00820.47-1341.03Table I.

The baobab fruit pulp is particularly high in valine, tryptophan and phenylalanine + tyrosine. Comparing to baobab leaves, baobab fruit pulp is inferior in terms of overall protein quality (Sena et al., 1998). There is a large variability in the reported amino acid contents of baobab fruit pulp, despite the fact that the authors uses similar methods for determination (Chadare et al., 2009). Fatty Acid ProfileMost fatty acids in the pulp do not reach detectable levels. Similarly to the amino acids, the variability in the reported values in high, even though the use of identical methods by the researchers (Chadare et al., 2009). Glew et al. (1997) recorded total lipid content of 155 mg/g dry weight, and stated that significant linoleic acid is present. Sena et al. (1998) also points baobab fruit out as a rich source of linoleic acid, 27 mg/g dry weight, whereas it contains a very low amount of α-linolenic acid (<1 mg/g) (Table IV). The two fatty acids which are essential for human nutrition are linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) (Sena et al., 1998).  Mineral CompositionSeveral reports have studied the mineral composition of baobab fruit pulp (Nour et al., 1980; Becker, 1983; Arnold et al., 1985; Obizoba & Amaechi, 1993; Prentice et al., 1993; Saka & Msonthi, 1994; Smith et al., 1996; Glew et al., 1997; Sena et al., 1998; Lockett et al., 2000; Osman, 2004) (Table V). However, the reported mineral contents of baobab pulp show a great variability between authors which can be due to different methods used (Chadare et al., 2009). Baobab fruit pulp contains very little iron and is a relatively poor source of manganese, but contains exceptionally high calcium content (Sena et al., 1998; Osman, 2004). The high calcium contents of the fruit pulp make baobab fruits attractive as a natural source of calcium supplementation for pregnant and lactating women, as well as for children and the elderly (Osman, 2004; Prentice et al., 1993). Chadare et al. (2009) estimated the contribution of baobab pulp to the recommended daily intake (RDI) for iron, zinc and calcium for children and pregnant women. The cov-erage of those minerals is possible only when the highest reported values are considered for the pulp. Thus, considering the highest reported values, the consumption of 40 g of baobab pulp for children is enough to cover 41.5% of the DRI for iron, 25.4% of the RDI for zinc, and 35% for the RDI for calcium. For pregnant women, the consumption of 60 g and 100 g would cover 23.1% and 38.4% of the DRI for iron, 17.3% and 28.7% for the RDI for zinc, and 42.1% and 70.1% for the RDI for calcium, respectively. afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 20 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeAmino Acid A B C DCrude protein (Total protein) 27.00 170.00 - -Aspartic acid ASP 2.96 15.90 - 6.40Glutamic acid GLU 3.94 38.80 4.02 6.50Serine SER 1.18 8.80 - 3.20Glycine GLY 1.21 7.00 - 2.90Histidine HIS 0.42 3.80 2.71 1.20Arginine ARG 2.28 19.30 6.04 7.60Threonine THR 0.65 5.70 2.96 2.80Alanine ALA 2.21 7.20 - 3.30Proline PRO 2.35 7.50 0.92 2.20Tyrosine TYR 1.06 4.70 4.21 20.60Valine VAL 1.62 9.10 0.43 4.80Methionine MET 0.14 1.60 4.92 0.20Isoleucine ILE 1.37 6.50 10.73 2.20Leucine LEU 2.06 10.90 8.41 4.30Phenylalanine PHE 1.09 8.40 4.11 4.40Lysine LYS 1.63 8.70 14.62 1.70Cysteine CYS 1.37 3.60 11.23 1.00Tryptophan TRP 0.18 2.80 1.49 -Table II.

Baobab fruit pulp has among the highest vitamin C or ascorbic acid content found in any fruit (Carr, 1955; Nicol, 1957). Umoh (1988, cited in Nnam & Obiakor, 2003) reports 373 mg/100 g wet weight, which is more than six times the level of vitamin C in citrus fruits (30-50 mg/100 g wet weight) and the highest known in natural fruits. Besco et al. (2007) documented an ascorbic acid content in baobab fruit ranging from 150-499 mg/100 g of product. Scheur-ing et al. (1999) revealed a remarkable baobab tree-to-tree variability for vitamin C con-tent in the fruit pulp, ranging from 1500-5000 mg/kg and reported that it was quite stable from one year to the next. The exact vitamin C content depends on the individual tree (Sidibe et al., 1996). With baobab fruit powder, a drink with a vitamin C content equal to that of orange juice is easily obtained. However, to retain vitamin C in soft drinks it is important not to boil the pulp but rather to add the powder to previously boiled water (Sidibe et al., 1996). Chadare et al. (2009) estimated the contribution of baobab pulp to the recommended daily intake (RDI) for vitamin C for children and pregnant women. The consumption of 13.9 g of pulp with the lowest reported vitamin C content and 8.3 g of pulp with the highest reported vitamin C content is enough to cover the RDI for a child. The consumption of 40 g of pulp by a pregnant women will cover 84 to 141% of her RDI of vitamin C, considering the lowest and the highest vitamin C content of the pulp reported by authors. Baobab fruit contains detectable levels of α-carotene (0.17 µg/g dry weight) and lutein (1.53 µg/g dry weight) (Sena et al., 1998). Toury et al. (1957) and Oliviera (1974) (both cited in Nour et al., 1980), point out baobab pulp as a valuable source of thiamine. Becker (1983) reported thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin content of 0.04, 0.07 and 2.16 mg/100g dw, respectively. The methods used to determine each vitamin are seldomly de-scribed according to Chadare et al. (2009), which makes it hard to evaluate these figures critically. Baobab MilkIn some areas the use of baobab milk is very common. The dried pulp is scraped from baobab fruits and made into a solution (Figure 6). Figure 6. Pulp and seeds of baobab are crushed (1) and diluted with water or fresh milk (2) as a beverage.(Source: Emmy De Caluwé, Benin, 2004).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 24 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeThe milk is a highly nutritious drink (Obizoba & Anyika (1994) cited in Gebauer et al., 2002). Baobab milk can be made from a mixture of baobab and acha flour, or from baobab pulp alone. Acha (Digitaria exilis) and baobab (Adansonia digitata) grains are cleaned, fermented for 24 to 120 hours, dried and hammer-milled into fine flours. The mixtures were composed of 70% acha and 30% baobab flours (70:30 protein ba-sis) (Obizoba & Anyika, 1994). Baobab milk contains more protein (1.5%) and minerals (Fe : 17.8 mg; Ca: 134.2 mg) than human milk (protein: 1.3%; Fe: 0.2 mg; Ca: 30 mg) or cow milk (Fe: 0.1 mg; Ca: 1.20 mg) and most leading national commercial infant milk powder formulas e.g. Cerelac (Fe: 10.0 mg). The composite flours contain more nutri-ents than the baobab or the acha flour alone (Obizoba & Anyika, 1994). SeedsThe vernacular name for Adansonia digitata, baobab, means ‘fruit with many seeds’ (Ajayi et al., 2003) (Figure 7). Figure 7. Baobab seeds (Source: Emmy De Caluwé, Benin, 2004).The seeds are eaten raw or are roasted and have a pleasant nutty flavour (Wehmeyer (1971) cited in Arnold et al., 1985). Murray et al. (2001) reported that baobab seed flour is an important source of energy and protein. The nutritious seeds have high values for pro-teins, fats (oils), fibre and most minerals (Arnold et al., 1985). The baobab seed contains appreciable quantities of oil (29.7%, expressed on a dry weight basis) (Addy & Eka (1984) cited in Nnam & Obiakor, 2003) (Figure 8). Besides, baobab seeds have high levels of lysine, thiamine, calcium, and iron (FAO (1988) cited in Nnam & Obiakor, 2003). Baobab seed can be classified as both protein- and oil-rich. It is also a very rich source of energy and has a relatively low fat value (Igboeli et al., 1997).afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 25 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyFigure 8. Two different kinds of baobab seed oil (Source: Emmy De Caluwé).Fermentation of baobab seeds decreases protein and carbohydrate but increases fat levels. Fermentation has varied effects on the mineral concentrations of the baobab seeds (Nnam & Obiakor, 2003). Chemical CompositionAccording to Osman (2004), the seed contains relatively high amounts of pro-tein, crude fat, and crude fibre, and low levels of carbohydrates. The baobab seeds have been subjected to extensive research, a the proximate analysis of the seeds are provided (Table VI).According to estimations made by Chadare et al. (2009), consumption of 20 g can cover 15 to 34% of the protein recommended daily intake (RDI) for children; while for pregnant women 60 g can cover 27% of the RDI based on the highest reported content. Moreover, consumption of 100 g can cover 22% of the energy RDI for pregnant women and 29.4% of energy RDI for children.afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 26 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeConstituentABCDEFGHIJKLMMoisture8.106.114.807.404.718.106.126.387.80-5.02-4.30Dry matter---------8.19---Protein33.7014.4036.6035.1021.7532.7021.4226.7030.0015.1213.3025.4518.40Fat30.6016.1429.3029.1012.7234.1017.5123.5029.6011.5633.0018.8712.20Ash5.904.959.108.405.015.002.155.507.905.767.507.613.80Crude fibre16.90-14.10-6.71-7.15--49.7220.14-16.20Carbohydrate4.8056.7511.20a-52.5330.0037.1637.9224.9217.8420.9848.0745.10Metabolizable energy (kcal/100 g)430.64462.17454.00-446.50-181.62469.98452.00---363.80Table VI.

(1997); B: Odetokun (1996); C: Osman (2004).In contrast to other plant seed protein profiles, baobab seed protein contains a high amount of lysine. Because lysine is limited in most cereal plants, it may be possible to use baobab seed protein to improve cereal protein quality (Osman, 2004). The high protein solubility at acidic and alkaline pH suggests that the baobab seed protein could be an adequate food ingredient (Osman, 2004).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 28 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeTable VIII provides a list of the essential amino acid content of baobab fruit pulp compared to WHO’s ‘ideal’ standards (Glew et al., 1997; Addy & Eteshola (1984) cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002).

(1997); B: Addy & Eteshola (1984, cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Fatty Acid ProfileThe oil of baobab seeds contained high proportions of linoleic and oleic acid as well as palmitic and α-linolenic acid (Glew et al., 1997; Ezeagu et al., 1998) (Table IX). According to Osman (2004), baobab seed oil is an excellent source of mono-and polyun-saturated fatty acids. The principal fatty acids in baobab oil are linoleic and oleic acid, 39.42% and 26.07% respectively. Of the total fatty acids 73.11% is unsaturated while 26.89% is saturated (Ajayi et al., 2003). Polyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in modulating human metabolism, therefore, the high linoleic acid content is of nutritive significance. The ability of some unsaturated vegetable oils to reduce serum cholesterol level may focus attention on the seed oil of baobab (Ajayi et al., 2003). This high content of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids suggests that baobab seed oil would be useful as a food oil (Osman, 2004). The saponification value is high, suggest-ing that baobab oil may be suitable for soap making (Nkafamiya et al., 2007).afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 29 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyFatty Acid A B C D E FTotal fatty acid content - 67.79 - - - -C12:0 Lauric - - 0.34 0.15 - -C14:0 Myristic Tr 1.90 1.46 0.90 - 0.20C16:0 Palmitic 1.43 155.00 2.22 35.5 4.43 24.20C16:1n-7 Palmitoleic 0.02 2.00 1.65 1.00 - -C18:0 Stearic 0.16 31.20 - 0.40 3.98 4.60C18:1n-9 Oleic 2.14 246.90 58.71 40.00 26.07 35.80C18:2n-6 Linoleic 1.38 191.10 23.25 20.50 39.42 30.70C18:3n-3 α-Linolenic 1.02 15.80 8.17 4.00 - 1.00C20:0 Arachidic Tr 7.40 - 0.75 2.26 1.30C20:1 Gadoleic - 1.90 3.64 1.80 4.01 0.90Total lipid content 90.00 - - - - -Table IX.

Mineral CompositionThe most important minerals in baobab seeds are calcium and magnesium (Table X). Nkafamiya et al. (2007) reported phosphorous, calcium and potassium as the major mineral elements present in the seeds. At the same time, the seeds are a poor source of iron, zinc and copper (Glew et al., 1997; Lockett et al., 2000; Osman, 2004). The huge differences found may be due to the use of different methods, but may also have other causes (Chadare et al., 2009).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 30 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeMineralsABCDEFGHCaCalcium273.002.00395.00264.000.50410.0058.904.34CuCopper2.780.41ND1.190.022.60-0.27FeIron6.551.271.834.350.636.406.366.70KPotassium1275.00---0.60910.00280.00173.64MgMagnesium640.00-352.00278.00-270.00-11.04MnManganese--1.061.01---1.52Na Sodium2.48-1.94--28.306.071.71PPhosphorus5.120.20614.00678.00326.33-6.00-ZnZinc6.681.902.574.291.295.203.601.03Table X.

(2003).afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 31 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology Anti-nutritional FactorsThe acceptability and optimal utilization of baobab seed as a protein source is lim-ited by the presence of anti-nutritional factors such as trypsin inhibitors, protease inhibi-tors, tannins, phytic acid, oxalate, alkaloids, phytate and amylase inhibitors (Proll et al., 1998; Osman, 2004). Osman (2004) investigated the anti-nutritional factors in baobab seeds and found that they contain a Trypsin Inhibitor Activity of 5.7 TIU/mg sample, 73 mg/100 g of phytic acid and 23% catechin equivalent of tannin. While processing tech-niques may ‘rob’ a food item of some nutrients, processing systems may also enhance food nutritional quality by reducing or destroying the anti-nutrients present. Some of the commonly used processing techniques include soaking in water, boiling in alkaline or acidic solutions. A decrease in tannin contents of baobab seeds was observed after a cold-water, hot-water and hot-alkali treatment. This can be explained by several possi-bilities: tannins are water soluble, tannin molecules are degraded when heated, heating may cause the formation of water-soluble complexes with other macromolecules of the seeds or reaction between tannic acid and the base. Dehulling and cold-water treatment of seeds greatly reduced the activity of amylase inhibitors (Igboeli et al., 1997).Sun drying, roasting and fermentation are traditional processing techniques that were tested by Obizoba & Amaechi (1993) to improve the chemical composition of both baobab pulp and seed. They showed that fermentation of the seeds for 6 days offered much advantages over roasting as shown by crude protein, moisture and minerals con-tents. A 6-day fermentation appeared to be the most promising method for producing nutritious food from baobab seed (Obizoba & Amaechi, 1993).Nnam & Obiakor (2003) reported that fermentation decreased the tannin levels in baobab seed. Tannins are known to reduce the availability of proteins, carbohydrates, and minerals by forming indigestible complexes with nutrients. The reduced tannin level due to fermentation could improve the availability of nutrients in the seed.When comparing the different processing methods such as boiling in water, acid or alkali or fermentation, the alkali treatment exhibited the best results (Addy et al., 1995). Alkali treatment appeared to be the most effective method for reducing trypsin inhibitor and tannin contents, and had the additional advantage of improving protein digestibility. However, such alkali treatments may also cause the production of harmful compounds, such as lysinoalanine wich is nephrotoxic to rats (De Groot & Slump (1969) cited in Addy et al., 1995). LeavesDepending on the season, families use either fresh and/or dried leaves, which can serve as a significant protein and mineral source for those populations for whom it is a staple food (Sidibe & Williams, 2002) (Figure 9). In general, baobab leaves are nutrition-ally superior to the fruit of the tree (Sena et al., 1998). Relative to fruits, leaves contain more essential amino acids, minerals and vitamin A which make them more interesting as a food source because they cover a broader range of nutritional factors.afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 32 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeFigure 9. Baobab leaves (Source: Emmy De Caluwé, Benin, 2004). Chemical CompositionAccording to Sidibe & Williams (2002), based on the data of Becker (1983), Yazzie et al. (1994) and Nordeide et al. (1996), the leaves contain (expressed on dry weight ba-sis): 13–15% protein, 60–70% carbohydrate, 4–10% fat and around 11% fibre and 16% ash (see also Table XI). Energy value varies between 1180-1900 kJ/100g of which 80% is metabolizable energy (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Chadare et al. (2009) calculated that, without considering the conversion factor or the effect of processing, the consumption of 20 g of dry leaf material would cover 10 to 16% of the protein recommended daily in-take for children.Chadare et al. (2009) concluded that the variability in the reported values for baobab leaves is lower than for the macronutrient composition of the pulp, despite the use of dif-ferent measurement methods by the authors. This can be due to the rather low number of authors who investigated the macronutrient composition of the leaves.afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 33 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyConstituent A B CDry matter - 93.60 8.23Protein 13.40 14.00 10.14Fat 4.00 4.30 6.25Ash - 10.80 15.90Crude fibre 11.00 - 27.49Carbohydrate 60.00 64.60 40.21Metabolizable energy (kJ/100 g) 1180.00 1480.00 -Table XI.

(2000).The leaves also contain an important amount of mucilage (Gaiwe et al. (1989) cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Ten percent of the dry matter of leaves consists of mucilage (Diop et al., 2005). Woolfe et al. (1997, cited in Shukla et al. 2001), found that the mucilage is an acidic polysaccharide with associated proteins and minerals. Amino Acid ProfileOn a qualitative and quantitative basis, baobab leaf appears to be a good source of protein for those populations for whom this plant material is a staple (Yazzie et al., 1994). The amino acid profile has been previously reviewed (Yazzie et al., 1994; Nordeide et al., 1996; Glew et al., 1997; Sena et al., 1998). Because Nordeide et al. (1996) showed results in units (mg of amino acid/g N) that differ from those found by other researchers (Yazzie et al., 1994; Glew et al., 1997) (mg of amino acid/g dry weight), these data are not com-pared to each other in this review. Nordeide et al. (1996) concluded that baobab leaves are potentially protein sources to be used to complement the amino acid profile to improve the overall protein quality of the local diet. Baobab leaf contains 10.6% protein on a dry weight basis and significant amounts of all the common amino acids (Table XII) (Yazzie et al., 1994).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 34 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeAmino Acid A B CCrude protein (Total protein) 106.30 103.00 112.00Aspartic acid ASP 10.30 12.90 12.40Glutamic acid GLU 13.40 11.40 14.40Serine SER 4.70 4.55 4.50Glycine GLY 6.00 5.57 5.40Histidine HIS 2.10 2.18 2.40Arginine ARG 8.50 7.07 8.30Threonine THR 4.10 3.65 4.30Alanine ALA 6.90 6.58 6.80Proline PRO 5.60 6.76 6.40Tyrosine TYR 4.50 4.15 4.30Valine VAL 6.30 6.55 7.00Methionine MET 2.40 1.04 1.50Isoleucine ILE 6.70 5.46 6.10Leucine LEU 8.70 8.75 9.80Phenylalanine PHE 5.70 6.02 6.70Lysine LYS 6.10 6.11 6.40Cysteine CYS 2.70 2.11 2.40Tryptophan TRP 1.60 2.05 3.40Table XII.

(1998).To provide a reference point, Yazzie and collaborators (1994) compared the amino acid composition of baobab leaf to the ‘ideal’ protein as defined by the World Health Organization which is based on the amino acid needs of a preschool child. Baobab leaves contain the same amount or more of the following essential amino acids as contained in the ‘ideal’ protein: lysine (5.7%), arginine (8.0%), threonine (3.9%), valine (5.9%), tyrosine + phenylalanine (9.6%), tryptophan (1.5%) and methionine + cysteine (4.8%) (Yazzie et al., 1994). A calculation of the ‘chemical’ score of protein quality using tryp-tophan, the most limiting of the essential amino acids, shows that the leaves contain sig-nificant amounts of all the essential amino acids (Yazzie et al., 1994). In terms of protein content and WHO standards, leaves of baobab can be rated “good” in that they score well for 5 of the 8 essential amino acids (Table XIII). For each of the eight essential amino acid categories baobab leaves score close to or above the 100% mark.afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 35 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyAmino Acid A B CThreonine 93.00 87.50 95.00Valine 124.00 128.00 124.00Methionine + cystine 139.00 85.71 100.00Isoleucine 130.00 132.50 138.00Leucine 136.00 121.43 124.00Phenylalanine + tyrosine 162.00 165.00 163.00Lysine 105.00 107.27 104.00Tryptophan 77.50 50.00 75.00Table XIII.

(1998).The fact that the leaves contain significant amounts of tryptophan has at least two implications. First, for those people for whom baobab leaves are a staple, this food source may provide significant amounts of tryptophan. Second, since a part of the niacin require-ment in humans can be satisfied by the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (Satyanaryana & Rao (1983) cited in Yazzie et al., 1994), baobab leaf may also serve as a niacin source. Fatty Acid ProfileFew authors investigated the fatty acid content of baobab leaves, and the reported data by Glew et al. (1997) and Sena et al. (1998) show many differences (Chadare et al., 2009). Total lipid content of baobab leaves was reported to be 55 mg/g of dry weight, though the fatty acid composition revealed that the leaves did not provide significant sources of linoleic acid (Glew et al., 1997) (Table XIV). This observation was also confirmed by Sena et al.

Mineral CompositionBaobab leaves are also significant sources of minerals (Becker, 1983; Prentice et al., 1993; Yazzie et al., 1994; Nordeide et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996; Glew et al., 1997; Sena et al., 1998; Lockett et al., 2000; Boukari et al., 2001; Barminas et al., 2007) as shown in Table XV. Some studies (Glew et al., 1997; Lockett et al., 2000; Barminas et al., 2007) reported that baobab leaves have a higher content of iron compared to numerous other wild-gath-ered foods, and are a rich source of calcium. Yazzie et al. (1994) highlight baobab leaves as a substantial source of calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, and zinc. Since iron-deficiency anaemia is common in regions of Africa were baobabs grow, the leaves may represent an important source of iron (Yazzie et al., 1994; Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Barminas et al. (1998) showed that baobab leaves can be a valuable and important contributor in the diets of rural and urban people. A serving por-tion (300 g fresh leaves or 30 g dry weight leaves) contributes 46.2% to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of phosphorus, 57.1% to the RDA of magnesium, 74.2% to the RDA of calcium, 84.4% to the RDA of iron, 106.0% to the RDA of manganese, 45.0% to the DRA of copper, and 62.7% to the RDA of zinc (Barminas et al., 2007). According to Chadare et al. (2009) and considering the highest reported values, 20 g would cover 89% of the zinc recommended daily intake (RDI) and 66% of the calcium RDI for children. Similarly, consumption of 20 g will cover 53% of the calcium RDI and 41% of the zinc RDI for pregnant women.Comparisons between published data on the minerals iron, calcium, zinc and phos-phorous show wide variations in content (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). The plant state of maturation, genetic variances, and environmental factors are all possible explanations afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 37 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyfor the reported discrepancies (Nordeide et al. (1996) cited in Boukari et al., 2001). More-over, mineral composition in food may vary greatly depending on where the food was grown (Boukari et al., 2001), on seasonal variations (Yazzie et al., 1994), and on the used analytical method (Boukari et al., 2001). The latter was also discussed by Chadare et al. (2009). In addition, the bioavailability of these minerals has not yet been investigated. Although, this is necessary to determine to which extend baobab leaves can be used to combat certain micronutrient deficiency problems (Chadare et al., 2009).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 38 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeMineralsABCDEFGHIJCaCalcium2600.001750.001087.331810.00-2000.001470.002526.002240.001824.60CuCopper----0.53a0.29b0.49c1.16<0.501.02-1.60FeIron24.00-128.7041.0027.80a21.20b11.70c15.5098.6093.10-30.60KPotassium--1541.00---583.00---MgMagnesium--427.67-93.60a121.70b274.20c549.00423.00246.00-400.60MnManganese--7.09-9.84a1.85b2.01c3.108.766.82-6.60PPhosphorous250.00193.00185.33--302.00153.00115.00-875.60NaSodium-----163.003.82---ZnZinc--3.692.501.97a0.74b1.21c1.871.751.24 -22.40Table XV.

Vitamin A in the human diet is usually esti-mated in terms of Retinol Equivalent: 1µg RE = 6 µg ß-carotene or 12 µg α-carotene (Scheuring et al., 1999). The amount of carotenoids in baobab leaves depends on the tree and the method of leaf drying. The simple practice of drying leaves in the shade doubles the provitamin A content of the leaf powder (Scheuring et al., 1999). The choice of small leaves, which is tree-specific, further increased provitamin A by 20% (Sidibe et al., 1996; Scheuring et al., 1999). The use of leaves harvested from old or young trees does not seem to have any effect on the level of pro-vitamin A. The combination of small leaves and shade drying enabled the retention of the provitamin A content up to 27 µg retinol equivalent per gram of dried leaf powder (Scheuring et al., 1999). To maintain the highest vitamin content, storage of baobab leaves as whole leaves rather than ground leaf powder has been recommended (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Sena et al. (1998) shows also high con-tent of lutein (50.9 µg/g dry weight). Becker (1983) reported vitamin A, thiamine, ribo-flavin and niacin content of 1618 µg RE, 0.13, 0.82 and 8.06 mg/100 g dw, respectively. BarkBaobab bark is mainly used for medicinal properties. Secondly, the bark is well-known for its fibers used to make ropes, sacks, clothes, baskets and mats (Sidibe & Williams, 2002) (Figure 10). The bark from the lower part of the stem can be removed to produce a valuable fibre. If managed properly the trees are not seriously damaged, and even after repeated use the bark regenerates and can be stripped again some years later (ICRAF, 2007). Modibbo et al. (2009) found that baobab appears to have high per-centage extension at break compared to other fibres. The relative proportions of amor-phous, which is relatively high in baobab bast fibres, to crystalline regions are presumed to be the major determinant. Figure 10.

Baobab bark which is often given to infants to promote weight gain (Lockett & Grivetti, 2000) was found to be high in fat, calcium, copper, iron, and zinc (Lockett et al., 2000).Friedelin, lupeol and baurenol (all three terpenoids) were identified in the leaf bark of baobab. In addition, betulinic acid was isolated from the bark whereas the leaf exclu-sively yielded taraxerone and acetate of lupeol and baurenol (Odetokur (1996) cited in Shukla et al., 2001). Biological Activity Anti-oxidant ActivityDietary antioxidants, including polyphenolic compounds, vitamins E and C, and carotenoids, are believed to be effective nutrients in the prevention of oxidative stress related diseases (Kaur & Kapoor 2001) cited in Besco et al., 2007), such as inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer and aging related disorders (Willet (2001) cited in Besco et al., 2007). The high antioxidant capacity of products deriving from Adansonia digitata show their therapeutical, nutraceutical and cosmoceutical potential. Moreover, in view of the very high antioxidant capacity, some authors (Vertuani et al., 2002; Besco et al., 2007) have proposed the red fiber as a new value-added ingredient for food preparation and/or nutraceutical application in the promotion of health. Research studies have (Vertuani et al., 2002; Besco et al., 2007) compared the overall antioxidant capacity (IAC), corre-sponding to the sum of the corresponding water- and lipid-soluble antioxidants capacity, of baobab plant products with those of orange and kiwi. The IAC value for the examined products resulted as follows: baobab red fibre (1617.3) >>> baobab fruit pulp (240.5) >> baobab fresh leaves (89.0) >> baobab seeds (51.4) > orange fresh fruit pulp (24.3) > kiwi fruit pulp (2.4). Vitamin C Healing EffectVitamin C is a powerful antioxidant and extremely important in human nutrition. Vitamin C has been shown to be related to low blood pressure, enhanced immunity against many tropical maladies, lower incidence of cataract development and lower in-cidence of coronary disease. The daily recommended intake for healthy, non-smoking adults is 65 mg; smokers need more vitamin C than non-smokers. While 65 mg/day is the minimum recommended intake, a full saturation of the total pool of vitamin C in the body is about 140 mg/day. Convalescents recovering from infectious diseases or nursing mothers benefit significantly from daily intakes exceeding 250 mg. Using the average vitamin C content of baobab fruit, 2800 mg/kg, the recommendations can be converted into amounts of baobab powder. The daily recommended dose of vitamin C can be obtained from 23 g of baobab powder. The daily saturation of the vitamin C pool in the body requires 50 g of baobab powder; the special dosage for convalescents is 90 g (Sidibe et al., 1996).afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 41 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology Anti-viral ActivityAdansonia digitata root-bark and leaf methanol extracts have shown high antiviral activity against Herpes simplex, Sindbis and Polio (Anani et al., 2000), together with viri-cidal (direct inactivation of virus particles) and also intracellular antiviral activity, which could indicate the presence of multiple antiviral compounds, or a single compound with multiple actions (Hudson et al., 2000). Whether such studies will show as effective results in humans is unknown but these couple of preliminary reports may provide rationale behind some of the medicinal uses of this plant. Anti-inflammatory and Anti-pyretic ActivityAccording to Ramadan and co-workers (1993), aqueous extract of the baobab fruit pulp produced a marked anti-inflammation activity. This effect could be due to the presence of sterols, saponins and triterpenes in the fruit pulp. The extract also shows a marked antipyretic activity (Ramadan et al., 1993). The antipyretic activity of the extract resembles that normally induced by standard dose of administered acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in hyperthermic rats (Ramadan et al., 1993). Analgesic and antipyretic activities were also mentioned by UN (2005, cited in Masola et al., 2009), probably due to the pres-ence of sterols, saponins and triterpenes in the fruit pulp. Leaves are applied locally for a variety of inflammatory conditions, insect bites and guinea worm sores (Shukla et al., 2001).  Anti-microbial ActivityAn acid medium, as created by the addition of baobab pulp powder to tempe fer-mentation could prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella sp., Bacil-lus sp. and Streptococcus sp. (Afolabi et al., 2005). Moreover, increasing concentrations of baobab pulp powder led to an increase in the population of lactic acid bacteria. This is beneficial to consumers since most of the lactic acid bacteria species are nontoxic and have been reported to produce an enzyme that breaks the oligosaccharides in soybean (main component of tempe) down to their mono- and disaccharide constituents. The presence of lactic acid bacteria in tempe prepared as it is being done locally in Nigeria will not only improve the digestibility of tempe, but will also extend the shelf life of the product because of the preservative attributes of lactic acid bacteria (Afolabi et al., 2005). There was some antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus fae-calis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium phlei (Anani et al. (2000) cited in Masola et al., 2009). Stem and root barks of baobab contain bioactive constituents which are responsible for antimicrobial activity of the crude aqueous and ethanolic extracts. This explains the scientific basis for the use of crude stem and or root bark extracts in traditional medicine e.g. for treatment of fever caused by malaria (Masola et al., 2009).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 42 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van damme Anti-trypanosoma ActivityExtracts of baobab roots eliminate the motility in Trypanosoma congolense within 60 minutes and drastically reduce motility in T. brucei brucei. T. brucei brucei and T. congolense are unicellular parasites transmitted by the bites of tsetse fly and is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and related diseases in animals (Atawodi et al., 2003). Uses in Traditional MedicineBaobab leaves, bark, pulp and seeds are used as food and for multiple medicinal pur-poses in many parts of Africa (Etkin & Foss (1982) cited in Yazzie et al., 1994; Diop et al., 2005). Ethnomedicine has been an intensive area of research, with several authors dis-cussing the main ethnomedicinal uses of baobab products (Table XVI). FruitBaobab is used in folk medicine as an antipyretic or febrifuge to overcome fevers. Both leaves and fruit pulp are used for this purpose. Fruit pulp and powdered seeds are used in cases of dysentery and to promote perspiration (i.e. a diaphoretic) (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Baobab fruit pulp has traditionally been used as an immunostimulant (El-Rawy et al. (1997) cited in Al-Qarawi et al., 2003), anti-inflammatory, analgesic (Ramadan et al. (1993) cited in Al-Qarawi et al., 2003), pesticide (Tuani et al. (1994) cited in Al-Qarawi et al., 2003), antipyretic, febrifuge, and astringent in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery (Ramadan et al. (1993) cited in Al-Qarawi et al., 2003). The fruit pulp has been evaluated as a substitute for improved western drugs (le Grand (1985) cited in Al-Qarawi et al., 2003). The aqueous extract of baobab fruit pulp exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity and, as a consequence, consumption of the pulp may play an important part in human resistance to liver damage in areas where baobab is consumed (Al-Qarawi et al., 2003). Medicinally, baobab fruit pulp is used as a febrifuge and as an anti-dysenteric, and in the treatment of smallpox and measles as an eye instillation (Burkill (ined.) cited in Wickens, 1979). In In-dian medicine, baobab pulp is used internally with buttermilk in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery. Externally, use is made of young baobab leaves, crushed into a poultice, for pain-ful swellings (Sidibe & Williams, 2002).  SeedsSeeds are used in cases of diarrhoea, and hiccough. Oil extracted from seeds is used for inflamed gums and to ease diseased teeth (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Since seed oil is used to also treat skin complaints, it can be considered to have cosmetic applications as well (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). LeavesPowdered leaves are used as an anti-asthmatic and known to have antihistamine and anti-tension properties. The leaves are also used to treat a wide variety of condi-tions including fatigue, as a tonic and for insect bites, Guinea worm and internal pains, and dysentery (Sidibe & Williams, 2002); and diseases of the urinary tract, opthalmia afrika focus — 2010-06 [ 43 ]Adansonia digitata L. – A review of traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyand otitis (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). In Indian medicine, powdered leaves are simi-larly used to check excessive perspiration (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Baobab leaves are used medicinally as a diaphoretic, an expectorant, and as a prophylactic against fever, to check excessive perspiration, and as an astringent (Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), Woodruff (1969) and Beltrame (1974) all cited in Wickens, 1979). The leaves also have hyposensitive and antihistamine properties. Leaves are used to treat kidney and bladder diseases, asthma, general fatigue, diarrhoea, inflammations, insect bites and guinea worm (Burkill (ined.) cited in Wickens, 1979). BarkThe widest use in tradition medicine comes from the baobab bark as a substitute for quinine in case of fever or as a prophylactic. A decoction of the bark deteriorates rap-idly due to the mucilaginous substances present. This process can be prevented by add-ing alcohol or a small quantity of sulphuric acid to the decoction (Kings (2002) cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002). Baobab bark is used in Europe as a febrifuge (antipyretic). In the Gold Coast (Ghana), the bark is used instead of quinine for curing fever (Shukla et al., 2001). In Indian medicine, baobab bark is used internally as a refrigerant, antipyretic and antiperiodic. It is used as a decoction, 30 g/l of water, boiled down to two thirds (Sidibe & Williams, 2002). The activity of baobab bark as a febrifuge, however, has not been detected in experimental malaria treatments, although it is both diaphoretic and antipe-riodic (Burkill (ined.) cited in Wickens, 1979). The bark, however, is certainly used for the treatment of fever in Nigeria (Oliver (1959) cited in Wickens, 1979). Moreover, the bark contains a white, semi-fluid gum that can be obtained obtainable from bark wounds and is used for cleansing sores (Burkill (ined.) cited in Wickens, 1979). According to Lousta-lot & Paga (1949, cited in Wickens, 1979) there are no alkaloids present in the bark, and accounts from Nigeria are inconclusive (Burkill (ined.) cited in Wickens, 1979). However, according to Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk (1962, cited in Wickens, 1979) the bark contains the alkaloid ‘adansonin’, which has a strophanthus-like action. In East Africa, the bark is used as an antidote to strophanthus poisoning. In Congo Brazzaville, a bark decoction is used to bathe rickety children and in Tanzania as a mouthwash for toothache (Burkill (ined.) cited in Wickens, 1979). Furthermore, a new flavanonol glycoside was reported in the root bark (Chauhan et al. (1984) cited in Ramadan et al., 1993). Baobab bark, fruit pulp and seeds appear to contain an antidote to poisoning by a number of Strophanthus species. The juice of these species has been widely used as an arrow poison especially in East Africa. In Malawi, a baobab extract is poured onto the wound of an animal killed in this way to neutralize the poison before the meat is eaten (Wickens, 1979; Wickens (1982) cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002). An infusion of roots is used in Zimbabwe to bathe babies to promote smooth skin (Wickens (1982) cited in Sidibe & Williams, 2002).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 44 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van dammeContinent/Country*Part(s)UsedEthnomedical UsesReferencesAfricaleavesdiaphoretic, expectorant, prophylactic against fe-ver, excessive perspiration, astringent, treatment kidney and bladder diseases, asthma, general fati-gue, diarrhoea, inflammations, insect bites, Guinea worm, hyposensitive, antihistamine properties, sources with poulticesWickens (1979 and 1982);Indiaemollient, maturant, diuretic, diaphoretic, febri-fugeKritikar (1993, cited in Shukla et al., 2001)-anti-inflammatory, insect bites, Guinea worm so-resShukla et al.

Ethnomedical Uses of Baobab (Continued).afrika focus — Volume 23, Nr. 1[ 48 ]e. de caluwe, k. halamova, p. van damme ConclusionsAdansonia digitata L. is a multipurpose tree species widely used for food and medi-cine. The baobab fruit pulp is probably the most important foodstuff. It can be dissolved in water or milk. The liquid is then used as a drink, a sauce, a fermenting agent in local brewing, or as a substitute for cream of tartar in baking. The fruit pulp has a very high vitamin C content and is a rich source of calcium. The acidic pulp is rich in pectin, contains a high amount of carbohydrate, is low in protein, and extremely low in fat. Nevertheless, the fruit pulp can be considered as a rich source of amino acids and linoleic acid. It con-tains a very low amount of α-linolenic acid and iron.Baobab seeds can be eaten fresh, or may be dried and ground into a flour which can either be added to soups and stews as a thickener, or roasted and ground into a paste, or boiled for a long time, fermented and then dried for use. The seeds can be classified as both protein- and oil-rich. They contain appreciable quantities of crude protein, digesti-ble carbohydrates and oil, whereas they have high levels of lysine, thiamine, Ca, Mg and Fe. Baobab seeds contain high proportions of linoleic and oleic acid as well as palmitic and α-linolenic acid. Processing eliminates a number of anti-nutritional factors present in the seeds. The leaves of the baobab tree are a staple for many populations in Africa. Young leaves are widely used, cooked like spinach, and frequently dried, often powdered and used for sauces over porridges, thick gruels of grains, or boiled rice. Baobab leaves are superior to fruit pulp in nutritional quality, and contain interesting levels of vitamin A. They appear to be a good source of protein, and contain particularly significant amounts of the amino acid tryptophan. Baobab leaves are a significant source of Fe, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P and Zn.Baobab bark is mainly used for its medicinal properties and for its fibres. The alka-loid ‘adansonin’ in the bark is thought to be the active principle for treatment of malaria and other fevers, as a substitute for quinine.Several plant parts have interesting anti-oxidant, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, and baobab has been used extensively since ancient times in traditional me-dicine. However, for baobab, the nutritional and medicinal data are widely scattered and research is fragmentary.  ReferencesAddy, E.O.H.; Salami, L.I., Igboeli, L.C. Remawa, H.S. (1995).
