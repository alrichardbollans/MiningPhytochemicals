These plants have found to have great therapeutic relevance for fighting major health problems.5-11Persea americana Mill. (Lauraceae) has been greatly appreciated in recent times and research-ers have found scientific support for its use in folk medicine.12 The parts of this plant have various applications in ethnomedicine, ranging from treat-ment of hypertension, diarrhea, dysentery, tooth-ache, anemia, intestinal parasites to the area of skin treatment and beautification.13 The leaves, seeds and fruits of P. americana are reported to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, antivi-ral, antihypertensive, antihypoglycemic, antiulcer, anticonvulsant, larvicidal Antihepatotoxic, vasore-laxant, toxicological activities.12,14-21 The analysis of part extracts of P. americana revealed the presence 1Department of Biology, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo2Department of Chemistry, University of Kinshasa, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo3Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Gbadolite, Nord-Ubangi, Democratic Republic of the Congo4Ubangi BioXplore Project (Biodiversity Exploration of Oubanguean Eco-region and Carbon Assessment), Nord-Ubangi Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo.5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Gitwe, P.O.

It is a medium to large tree, 9-20m in height. The avocado is classified as an evergreen, although some varieties lose their leaves for a short time before flowering. The tree canopy ranges from low, dense, and symmetrical to upright and asymmetrical. Leaves are 7-41cm in length and variable in shape (elliptic, oval, and lance-olate). They are often pubescent and reddish when young, becoming smooth, leathery, and dark green when mature while. Flowers are yellowish green and 1-1.3 cm in diameter. The many-flowered inflo-rescences are borne in a pseudoterminal position knowing that the central axis of the inflorescence terminates in a shoot. The fruit is a berry, consist-ing of a single large seed, surrounded by a buttery pulp. It contains 3-30% oil (Florida varieties range from 3% to 15%). The skin is variable in thickness and texture while the fruit colors once ripen is green, black, purple, or reddish, depending on the variety. The fruit shape ranges between spherical and pyri-form, and weighs up to 2.3 kg.25 Originally, it was only native to humid tropical areas of Mexico until it was later cultivated to other regions of Latin America as well as to USA and Europe.26 Ethno-botanical usesP. americana has been traditionally cultivated for food and medicinal purposes due to its high nutri-tion content as well as for its therapeutic virtues.27 This plant has a diverse application in ethnomed-icine, ranging from treatment of hypertension, diarrhoea, dysentery, toothache, intestinal parasites to the area of skin treatment and beautification.13 It was also used by women in the form of an ointment and also for treating skin eruptions.27 Leaf and seed extracts have been shown a variety of medicinal applications and are particularly used as antibiotic.28PHYTOCHEMISTRY OF P. AMERICANA Rosalinda et al.29 reported the presence of alkaloids, saponins, unsaturated steroids and triterpenoids (Leucoanthocyanins), fats and oils in the ethanol extract of P. americana. . Meanwhile, Uzor et al.15 reported the presence of flavonoids, steroids, sapo-nins, tanins, alkaloids, cyanogenic glycoside and Table 1 Nutrients of Hass Avocado [27, 36, 37]N° Analyte Quantity (g) N° Analyte Quantity (g)1 Total sugar 0.2 11 Vitamin B-6 0.2 mg2 High-monounsaturated fatty acids 6.7 g or 114 kcal 12 Niacin 1.3 mg3 Sodium 5.5 mg 13 Pantothenic acid 1.0 mg4 Potassium 345 mg 14 Riboflavin 0.1 mg5 Magnesium 19.5 mg 15 Choline 10 mg6 Vitamin A 43 µg 16 Lutein/Zeaxanthin85 mg7 Vitamin C 6.0 mg 17 Phytosterols 57 mg8 Vitamin E 1.3 mg 18 Dietary fiber 4.6 g9 Vitamin K1 14 µg10 Folate 60 mgTable 2 Fatty acid composition of Avocado oil [27]Palmitic acid 28.21Palmitoleic acid 5.69 Stearic acid 0.69Oleic acid 50.95Linoleic acid 13.87 Linolenic acid 0.58104 Discovery Phytomedicine 2019; 6(3): 102-111. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2019.99 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.caA mini-review on the ... Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua, et al.phenol present in both extract with ethanol extract having more of flavonoids, saponins and tannins in the seed (kernel) extract. Tocopherols have been identified as well in the avocado acetone extract.31 The isolation of the bioactive phytoconstituents of P. americana leaves (Lauraceae), yielded, isor-hamnetin, luteolin, rutin, quercetin and apigenin. Isorhamnetin was fully characterized as reported by Owolabi et al.12 P. americana contains a significant amount of oil compared to other fruits.30 However, several secondary metabolites have been isolated from different parts of P. americana. The predominant carotenoid in Avocado is Lutein while other carotenoids such as present α-carotene, β-caro-tene, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin and violaxanthin are in small quantity. These lipophilic carotenoids may have potential anti-carcinogenic effects.32 The avocado seed also contains various classes of natural products such as phytosterols and triterpenes,33 fatty acids with olefinic, acetylenic bonds, furanoic acid, dimmers of flavonols and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, β-D-glucoside of 8-hydroxyabscisic acid and epi-dihydropha-seic acid β-d-glucoside.34 The findings of the phytochemical analysis of the ethanol seed extract indicated the presence of alkaloids, saponins, unsaturated steroids and triterpenoids (Leucoanthocyanins), fats and oils.29The avocado fruit contains a lot of nutrients, and this includes its high content of essential minerals and vitamins. Several studies reported that P. amer-icana is also a rich source of vitamins such as A, C, E, K, B1, B2, B6, B9 and minerals such as phospho-rus, sodium, magnesium, potassium, iron and zinc, coenzyme Q10, beta-carotene, folic acid, lutein and zeaxanthin14,22-24 (tables 1 and 2).The proximate analysis of this fruit based on the dry weight showed the presence of following nutri-ents namely ash (4.2%), proteins (8.1%), oil (70%), dietary fibers (7.2%) and carbohydrates (10.5%). It also contains tannins 2.45g/kg wt of the seed28 and after the harvest, the oil content was found to change in terms of maturity between 49.5% and 70% from the raw material.35The presence of other fatty acids such as lignoc-eric acid, arachidic acid, margaric acid, behenic acid, gadolenic acid, docosadienoic, myristic and eicosanoic acids in small amounts has been found in analyses of the oil.19-21 The oil fortunately retains most of the phytochemicals and carotenoids pres-ent in the fruit.27The figure 2 gives different chemical structures of compounds isolated from P.

Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua, et al.BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES AND PHARMACOGNOSYDifferent bioactivities of P. americana are presented in the table 3.Antiviral activity De-Ameida et al reported40 the infusion and ethanol extract of dried leaves of P. americana were compared with respect to their inhibitory activities of viral replication in vitro. The chosen viruses for the initial screening were adenovirus type 3 (AD3), HSV-1, and ADV. The ethanol extract was only tested against HSV-1 and ADV. The infusate was active against the 3 viruses, whereas the ethanol extract did not show any activity under the experimental conditions employed.Antioxidant activityBanji et  al.41 reported the antioxidant activities of the seed oil of which the flavonoid content (80.00±1.41 mgQE/g) was ~10 folds higher than the phenolic content (8.27±0.06 mgGAE/g). The DPPH radical scavenging value was found to be 51.54±0.25% with an IC50 value of 4.68±0.02 mg/mL and reducing power with an average absorbance of 0.85±0.01 and an IC50 value of 0.001±0.02 mg/mL. Gallic acid showed better antioxidant activities than the oil studied. Compounds were evaluated for their ability to scavenge free radical using DPPH and H2O2 systems. The IC50 (mg/mL) of quercetin was 4.82 x 10-5; rutin, 1.37 x 10-4; luteolin, 3.34 x 10-4 and isorhamnetin, 4.41 x 10-4. H2O2 scav-enging activity of the compounds was quercetin > rutin > isorhamnetin > luteolin > apigenin > BHA (p > 0.05).42 The fruit is considered one of the most potent antioxidant fruit in the world because of its high content of mono unsaturated fats.43Hypoglycemic activity Anita et al.18 reported the hypoglycemic effects of P. americana aqueous leaf extract in the normal rats. The maximum antidiabetic activity was reached at 6 h after a single dose of the extract was adminis-tered, producing 60.02 ± 6.83% reduction in the blood glucose level.Heptoprotective and dermatological activitiesThe oil has also been used for the treatment of skin wounds, stretch marks and psoriasis. It also possesses heptoprotective activity.44-48Vasorelaxant activity It is reported that the aqueous leaves extract of the avocado has some vaso-relaxant effect on isolated rats and this effect is dependent on the synthesis or release of endothelium–derived relaxing factors as well as the release of the prostanoid, thus inhibiting Ca2+ influx through calcium channels.25The aqueous extract of P. americana (0.01-12.8  mg/mL) produced a concentration-related vasorelaxation response in the rings of rat aorta with intact endothelium pre-contracted with noradrena-line (1 × 10−7 M), with an EC50 of 0.88 + 0.03 mg/mL. In the endothelium-denuded rings, the vasore-laxant action of the aqueous extract of P. americana was significantly attenuated (EC50 .14F252.18 mg/mL). Cumulative addition of acetylcholine (1.1 × 10−8 to 1.4 × 10−5 M) produced relaxation of endo-thelium-intact rat aortic rings pre-contracted with noradrenaline (1 × 10−7 M). The vasorelaxant effect was significantly reduced by L-NAME (10−4 M) and methylene blue (10−6), but not affected by indo-methacin (10−5M). The aqueous extract of P. ameri-cana (1 or 5 mg/mL) produced a rightward shift of the concentration- response curves to noradrena-line (1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−9 M) and potassium chlo-ride (10-8 mM). In fact, this activity was blocked by L-NAME or methylene blue, suggesting that the vasorelaxation is dependent on the synthesis and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRFs). The blockade by indomethacin suggests that P. americana may also act by activating PGI2 and PGE2 receptors. The vasorelaxant effect may also be produced by the inhibition of Ca2+ mobiliza-tion through voltage-dependent channels and, to a lesser extent, through receptor-operated channels.12Analgesic and Anti-inﬂammatory activities The aqueous extract of P. americana leaves caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of the control writhes. The inhibition by 1600 mg/kg extract was similar to that produced by 100 mg/ kg of acetylsalicylic acid (57.2% and 58.0%, respec-tively). The inhibition (87.2%) shown by 800 mg/kg of the extract was same as morphine (2 mg/kg, 87.0%). There was a significant and dose- depen-dent inhibition of both phases, by the extract. A greater inhibition (77.1%) was produced by the extract (800 mg/kg) compared with acetylsalicylic acid (68%) in phase II of the test. The aqueous leaf extract of P. americana (800 mg/kg) produced a significant inhibition of the swelling caused by carrageenan at 3h. This effect was similar to that produced by indomethacin in the same duration.20Antimicrobial activityThe antimicrobial activity of seed extract of P. amer-icana against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans was determined using the agar well diffusion technique. The ethanol and petro-leum ether solvents were used for the extraction and they demonstrated promising activity against www.phytomedicine.ejournals.ca Discovery Phytomedicine 2019; 6(3): 102-111. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2019.99 109A mini-review on the ... Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua, et al.the tested organisms. The potency of ethanolic extract was more pronounced than the petroleum ether against E. coli with a maximum zone of inhi-bition of 26.0mm at 25mg/ml, followed by S. aureus and C. albicans with a zone of inhibition of 21.0 mm and 17.0 mm at a concentration of 25mg/ml. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that ethanol extract had the lowest MIC value of 0.625 mg/ml against E. coli, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) showed that ethanol had the lowest value at 1.25 mg/ml against S. aureus which indicated higher potency.15Antiulcer effectThe study was carried out to investigate the antiul-cer activity of aqueous leaf extract of P. americana. Groups of albino rats were pretreated orally with aqueous leaf extract of the plant before the admin-istration of the ulcerogenic drugs-indomethacin and ethanol. The extract produced significant and dose-dependent antiulcer activity against indo-methacin- and ethanol-induced ulcers in rat.19Hypertensive activityThe intravenous administration of doses of P. ameri-cana leaf aqueous and methanol extracts ranging from 6.25 to 50 mg/kg (pilot study indicated that doses above 50 mg/kg caused death of rats within 10 min of administration; therefore, the highest screening dose for i.p. injections was 50 mg/kg) to normotensive anesthetized rats produced dose-related hypotensive effects. The results revealed that dose above 12.5 mg/kg displayed hypotensive effects. Also, the duration of action appeared to be dose dependent. The aqueous extract of P. americana has been shown to produce vasorelaxation of the rat aortic ring and lower blood pressure. The seeds of P. americana has been reported to lower blood pressure in normotensive and hyper-tensive rat models; with reduction in the total choles-terol, LDL and triacylglycerol in the plasma, kidney, liver and heart of the hypertensive rat model at high dose of the seed extract.12,17Antihepatotoxic activity The methanolic extract of P. americana could be protective against liver toxicity and oxidative stress arising from acute paracetamol intoxication as reported in the literature.25 The mechanism of this protection is probably due to an antioxidant action of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase, which are the primary intracellular defense mechanisms to cope with increased oxidant stress. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes measured (SOD and CAT) did not change significantly in normal rats treated compared to the methanolic leaf extract of P. amer-icana However, the methanolic extract significantly induced the activity of these enzymes during hepatic damage produced by acute paracetamol toxicity. The methanolic leaf extract of P. americana and its hepatoprotective action against liver toxicity due to acute paracetamol toxicity make it a poten-tial agent against liver diseases and other patholo-gies associated with oxidative stress.25Larvicidal activityRosalinda et al.29 reported the evidence of larvicidal toxicity (activity) of different parts of P. americana extracted with n-hexane and ethanol. The n-hex-ane extract from the seeds exhibited the highest toxicity with LC50 and LC90 values of 9.82 mg/L and 22.19  mg/L, respectively, while the ethanol seed extract exhibited LC50 of 16.48 mg/L and LC90 of 45.77 mg/L, respectively. This was closely followed by the ethanol extract of the peels with an LC50 of 10.35 mg/L and LC90 of 26.29 mg/L. The pulp extracted with ethanol also yielded a great larvi-cidal toxicity with LC50 of 21.32 mg/L and LC90 of 59.45 mg/L. Anticonvulsant effect Aqueous leaf extract of P. americana demonstrated an anticonvulsant activity in mice. The effectiveness of the plant extract in the experimental convulsion paradigm probably used suggests that the plant could be used in both petit and grand mal types of epilepsy. The plant’s leaf extract was relatively more effective in Pentylene tetrazole (PTZ)- and picro-toxin (PCT)-induced convulsions than in bicucull-ine (BCL)-induced seizures. In general, the average onset and duration of convulsion was markedly delayed and reduced, respectively. These findings tend to show that P. americana leaf aqueous extract might have inhibited and/or attenuated PTZ-, PCT- and BCL-induced seizures of the mice used by enhancing, or in some ways interfering with, GABAergic action and/or neurotransmission.21Effect on body weight It is evident from Brail et al that the administration of aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts of P. amer-icana caused a reduction in body weight compared with the hyperlipidemic controls. It could be that P. americana leaf extracts increase the catabolism of lipids accumulated in the adipose tissue, resulting in a decrease in the mean body weight.38,39Reported Toxicological studies When the fruits extract of Persea americana admin-istered to wistar rats for acute toxicity studies, the animals did not exhibit any sign of toxicity even when large doses were given. The maximum toler-able dose (MTD) was therefore determined to be ≥ 10g/kg of body weight. The extract was found to 110 Discovery Phytomedicine 2019; 6(3): 102-111. doi: 10.15562/phytomedicine.2019.99 www.phytomedicine.ejournals.caA mini-review on the ... Koto-te-Nyiwa Ngbolua, et al.significantly decrease (p < 0.05) the activity of liver and heart enzymes in the treated animals when compared with the control. The extract decreased total cholesterol (TC) by 37.97%, triglycerides by 37.87%, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by 47,41%, low density lipoproteins (LDL) by 59.57%, and at the same time increased high density lipopro-tein (HDL) by 3.64%. The extract also decreased the prothrombin time (PT) and the partial prothrombo plastin time with kaolin (PTTK). These results are discussed with regard to the preventive and possible curative values of this extract as a potential inhibi-tor of cardiovascular diseases and in the regulation of blood clotting time due to its significant vitamin K content.14 Eduardo et  al.16 demonstrated that the ethanolic extract of P. americana seed showed an acute toxic effect at concentration starting at 500  mg/kg. In vivo mutagenicity on peripheral blood cells of the seed extract was not observed.Anticancer effectA triterpenoid compound isolated from the seed of Persea Americana displayed cytotoxic effect against breast MCF-7 (IC50: 62 µg/ml) and liver Hep G2 (IC50: 12 µg/ml) cancer cell lines and was safe to normal cells.49 While, Abiodun et  al.50 isolated from the root bark of P. americana an alkene lactone namely 4-hydroxy-5-methylene-3- unde-cyclidenedihy-drofuran–2(3H)–one which displayed a significant anticancer activity at the dose of 1 and 10 µg/mL. This class of compound caused a stimulatory effect on tumorigenic MCF-7 cells through a decrease of α4-, α6-, β-1- and β3- integrin expression.The work of D’Ambrosia at al.51 revealed that two aliphatic acetogenin constituents namely (2S,4S)-2,4-dihydroxyheptadec-16-enyl acetate and (2S,4S)–2,4 dihydroxyheptadec-16-ynyl acetate isolated from the fruit of P. americana exert their anticancer effect by blocking the signaling pathway of EGFR (Tyr 1173), C-RAF (Ser 338) and ERK ½ (Thr 202/Tyr 204) phosphorylation cascade.CONCLUSIONMedicinal plant species are rich in secondary metab-olites of pharmaceutical and midicinal relevance. The advantages of their therapeutic uses in various ailments are their safety besides being economical, effective and their availability. The current mini review was carried out with the aim of updating knowledge on the phytochemistry and various phar-macological properties of P. americana as common and traditionally edible fruit. The literature survey revealed that P. americana is a pharmacologically and chemically much studied plant species, although the diversity of secondary metabolites present in this plant species is enormously various.
