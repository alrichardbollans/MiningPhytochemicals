Chlorococcum is a cultivable alga with enormous biological and commercial applications. The present study aims to profile the species Chlorococcum infusionum for its phytochemical and biological potentialities. The species was cultured at 25±2 °C with a light intensity of 2500 lux (maximum) and a 7.3-7.5 pH level using Bold’s Basal Medium and obtained 0.9-1.2 g/L dry biomass. The proximate experiment is witnessed with high values of carbohydrate (67.7±0.00%), protein (26.9±0.12%), moisture (8.41±1.37%), and fiber (12.00±1.45%). The FTIR fingerprinting analysis determined the existence of macromolecular pools. It included the various functional groups originating from polysaccharides, amino acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, nitriles, alcohols, and amines. The GCMS analysis of this species encompasses 19 compounds, of which 13 are well known for their bio-potentialities. Significant antimicrobial activities are noticed against E. coli (14±0.57 mm) and P. syringae (14±0.57 mm) at 75 µg/mL concentration. Also, it exhibited notable antioxidant ability (IC50 = 28.17 ± 1.45 µg/mL) and cytotoxicity (IC50 = 36.12±1.55 µg/mL). The fallout of this present attempt states that C. infusionum could be a promising alternative resource for other microalgae to increase large-scale productivity in response to providing sustainable life from nature.  Keywords: biological resources; Chlorococcum infusionum; cytotoxicity; large-scale productivity; phytochemistry; sustainability   Introduction  Algae are the primitive group of organisms in the plant kingdom with diverse morphological and genetic features to dwell in all kinds of habitats, representing thousands of taxa in innumerable forms and sizes Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  2       (Andersen, 1992; Moreno-Garrido, 2008). They play an imperative role in the aquatic ecosystem as an indicator to determine pollution, trophic status, and species diversity. Typically, they function as autotrophic and photosynthetic primary producers, forming the first rung of the tropic food chain and converting numerous inorganic chemicals into organic forms (Mann and Vanormelingen, 2013). Algae's role in human life has become the world's most renewable green source, with massive demand for various ecological and economic aspects. Stimulating the algae's stressful nature with adequate nutrients triggers metabolic activities for forming various bioactive compounds (Barsanti and Gualtieri, 2018; Arora et al., 2022). As a result, algae have gained significant importance in the food, fodder, fuel, biomedical, and therapeutic firms. Microalgae or microphytes possess carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, pigments, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and numerous biologically potential compounds capable of bio-potentiality such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-parasitic, antiproliferative, anti-trypsin, anti-elastase, anti-chymotrypsin, angiotensin l-conversing enzyme inhibitory (ACE-inhibitory), hepatic fibrosis inhibitory, myofibroblast differentiation-inducing activities, etc., (Antonopoulou et al., 2005; Saha et al., 2015; Koukouraki et al., 2020).                Specifically, most biomedical and pharmaceutical products are derived, especially from members of the Chlorophyceae (Yamaguchi, 1997). It exhibits morphological and genetic plasticity and is augmented with a variety of bioactive compounds, which include PUFA, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, phycobiliproteins, phycotoxins, and amino acids (De Jesus Raposo et al., 2015; Encarnacao et al., 2015; Barkia et al., 2019). Also, members of this group have been involved in the bioremediation of domestic wastewater through the consumption of CO2 and the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous beyond the permissible level (Sutherland & Ralph, 2019). Furthermore, the abundance of biochemical compositions in microalgal biomass surpasses terrestrial plant sources, particularly regarding multiple products and their commercial value (Khan et al., 2018). However, the consumption and utilization of algal resources for commercialization remains unexplored.   In India, c. 7411 species of algal taxa belonging to 735 genera under 206 families were reported (Gupta, 2012 a, b; Botanical Survey of India, 2024). Among them, Arthrospira, Chlorella, Crypthecodinium, Cylindrotheca, Desmodesmus, Dunaliella, Haematococcus, Isochrysis, Nannochloris, Nannochloropsis, Nitzschia, Porphyridium, Schizochytrium and Spirulina were the freshwater microalgae specifically profiled with substantial applications (Sathasivam et al., 2019). Nevertheless, most freshwater algae have not been focused on and have not been examined yet for their significant role in various spectrums of science. Chlorococcum is a lesser-known genus under the Chlorophyceae that usually occurs in freshwater and marine habitats. Chlorococcum humicolo, C. hypnosporum, C. infusionum and C. vitiosum are the species reported from the various freshwater bodies of India with ambiguous taxonomical status due to their morphological plasticity (Shiels et al., 2021). This genus can potentially be a commercial source of ketocarotenoids due to its rapid growth rate, ease of cultivation, resistance to acidic conditions, and high temperatures (Zhang and Lee, 1999). The quantity of lipids, proteins, and chemical characterizations of oil and the possibility of its conversion to biodiesel provides insight into the industrial potential of Chlorococcum infusionum (Santhoshkumar et al., 2016). Moreover, species of Chlorococcum have been evidenced for their potentiality in oil for biodiesel production, lipid accumulation, bioremediation, removal of pollutants in water treatment, antibiotic activities against human pathogens, nutraceuticals, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic activities (Shiels et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the research on this genus in India is sporadic, and its significance for commercial applications has not yet been studied in detail. Therefore, the present attempt tends to account for the bio-profiling and bio-potentiality of C. infusionum from Shivamoagga district, Karnataka, India.    Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  3       Materials and Methods  Sampling of Chlorococcum infusionum  The algal sample was collected from the selected ponds Goutur (13° 59' 0.42'' N 75° 14' 57.84'' E), Keladi (14° 14' 0.2754" N 75° 1' 14.16" E), Mattur (13° 52' 37.2'' N 75° 34' 37.2'' E), Siddapura (13° 50' 13.2'' N 75° 40' 48'' E), Tammadikoppa (13° 41' 36.744'' N 75° 14' 11.112'' E) and Ulavi (14° 16' 32.448'' N 75° 6' 48.816'' E) of Shivamoagga district, Karnataka in different seasons and brought to the laboratory for further research (Figure 1).   Figure 1. Study area map of Shivamogga District represents the collection location of Chlorococcum infusionum found in the perennial ponds (QGIS version 3.18.0)   Isolation, culture and identification of microalgae The large solid/coarse particles, debris, epiphytes and undesirable planktons were removed using sedimentation and filtering by Whatman GF/C (1.2 µ) filter papers. The designated algal samples (100 mL) were transferred to a 1L conical flask holding 0.4 L of sterilized Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM) for enrichment. It was incubated under a controlled temperature (25±2 °C) with illumination using white fluorescent light (maximum 2500 lux) (Figure 2a). The algal growth and cultures were observed visually and examined microscopically. These procedures were repeated for each of the original flasks to obtain the pure culture. After the enrichment period, the purity of the cultures was observed and confirmed by repeated dilution and continuous microscopic observation (Nikon, Model: Eclipse 50i). Also, the species-level identification of pure culture was done by referring to the original protologue (Meneghini, 1883) and standard monographs (Philipose, 1967; Krishnamurthy, 2000; Perumal and Andand, 2008). Briefly, morphological characteristics of mature cells were analyzed, including the size and shape of cells, and the shape and number of chloroplasts (Figure 2a).   Quantitative analysis of moisture, ash, fat, fiber, protein, and carbohydrate The percentage of the moisture, ash, fat, fiber, protein, and carbohydrate present in C. infusionum was executed by standard protocols (Rathore, 2009; Joseph, 2011; Krishnamurthy and Sarala, 2012).    Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  4       Determination of secondary metabolites  Three different solvents were used for C. infusionum to determine the presence of secondary metabolites by standard protocols (Sofowara, 1993; Harborne, 1998; Kokate, 2000; Visweswari, 2013).  Determining functional groups by FTIR analysis The powder of C. infusionum was processed according to the optimized protocol (Satpati et al., 2016) to validate the presence of functional groups. The dried coarse biomass of C. infusionum was mixed with Potassium Bromide (KBr) and underwent pulverization in an agate mortar to obtain a fine fraction. Algal and KBr mixtures were combined into a pellet under vacuum using a spectra lab pelletizer. The infrared spectrum was measured using an IRPrestige-21 IR spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at the wave numbers, covering a range between 500-4000 cm−1.  Determination of chemical compounds by GC-MS (Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy) The process started at 40 °C for 1 min and proceeded to 240 °C at 40 C/min. Once attaining 240 ºC, the experiment ceased after 5 minutes of stable temperature. The column was heated to 140 ºC, and the injection volume was 1µl, with a split injection ratio of 1:100. An injector temperature of 240 ºC and a carrier gas of GC grade helium at 5 ml/min were used. Standard lab solutions data systems recorded peak area percentages. The results were subjected to the standard library for identifying the compounds in the algal extract.  Antibacterial activity of selected algal species C. infusionum crude extract was tested for antibacterial properties using a standard protocol (agar well diffusion) (Heatley, 1994). The selected bacterial strains Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-4734), Escherichia coli (MTCC-1599), Pseudomonas syringae (MTCC-1604), and Salmonella typhi (MTCC-734) were sub-cultured (broth medium) and maintained in laboratory conditions to avoid contamination. Nutrient agar plates had been incubated at 37 °C for 18-24 hours with the strains. Later, the newly cultured bacterial strains were inoculated over the solidified nutrient agar plates. A total of 6 wells (5mm) were made in the agar plates to test the activity in different concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL along with positive (Ampicillin) and negative (DMSO) controls. The wells were loaded with 100µl of extract (4 wells) and positive and negative controls using a micropipette and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. Afterward, the zone of inhibition expressed by the algal extracts and positive and negative control were examined. The experiments were performed thrice to get the average values of the experiment, and the antibacterial activity observations were denoted in Mean±SEM.  Antioxidant activity (DPPH assay) The ethanolic extract of C. infusionum was performed by DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1 picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging experiment. The algal extract was prepared in ethanol at different concentrations, including 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL, along with a 0.004% DPPH solution. Serial dilution (100-6.25 µg/mL) of freshly prepared DPPH solution was performed with each concentration of extracts and standard (Ascorbic acid). It was incubated at room temperature in dark mode for half an hour and the absorbance was measured at 517nm. The purple-to-yellow DPPH solution mark showed algal extract scavenging. Lower optical density indicated higher free radical scavenging in the reaction mixture. The formula for measuring radical scavenging:  Scavenging activity % = OD of control −OD of test sampleOD of control reaction× 100 whereas, OD - Optical density and the percentage inhibition value are mentioned in the IC50 value.

Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  5       Anti-cancerous activity (MTT assay) The anti-cancerous/cytotoxicity of C. infusionum was performed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) experiment. A459 cell line was maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) for incubation (37 °C) in 95% humidity and 5% CO2 overnight. The ethanolic of algal extract and Doxorubicin (standard) with cancer cells were incubated in 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL concentration for 48 hours. PBS and 20 µL MTT stain were employed to wash the well twice. After a 4-hour incubation at 37 °C, 100 µL of DMSO solution was added to every well to break down and dissolve the crystals of formazan. All coloured solutions were absorbed in 570 nm.  Following is the formula for intended cell viability: % Growth inhibition = 100– O. D. of individual test group / O. D. of control group   100  Statistical representation The terms of Mean±SEM represented the triplicated values of the results, and the significant differences among the assays were analyzed using ANOVA in OriginPro (8.5). With GraphPad Prism (8.3.4, IC50), values were calculated and presented.   Results and Discussion  Identification and preservation  Chlorococcum infusionum (Schrank) Menegh. Mem. Acad. Roy. Sci.

(2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  6       One of the essential criteria for choosing microalgae with promising bio-potential is a rapid cell growth pattern (Satpati et al., 2016). C. infusionum is cultured in the controlled environmental conditions of 25±2 °C temperature with a light intensity of 2500 lux (maximum) at the pH level of 7.3-7.5 using Bold’s Basal Medium. The dry biomass of C. infusionum ranges from 0.9 to 1.2 g/L, and the dry biomass of C. infusionum from the repeated culture was further used in the rest of the experiments in this study to evaluate the bio profiling of this species. Also, the pure culture was encapsulated to make Synthetic Seed Material (SSM) using 4 % of sodium alginate (NaC6H7O6) (4%) and 0.2 M of calcium chloride (CaCl2). The SSM was stowed in the fridge at 4 °C for long-term storage (Santhoshkumar et al., 2016) (Figure 2c, d).    Quantification of moisture, ash, fat, fiber, protein, and carbohydrate  The high nutritional values and functional properties of fresh and marine algal products will create an alternative resource for the human diet that demands a wide range of attention to commercializing the potentialities of algae. The components of the microalgae could be one of the foremost nourishment suppliers for the future due to their adaptability to sustain in various environmental conditions that beneficially affect human lifestyle (Fernandes et al., 2023). They possess carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, fibres, and other biologically active compounds of superior quality that have the potential to be used in addressing the current widespread issues of obesity and diabetes (Ramos-Romero et al., 2021). The current analysis of C. infusionum indicates the existence of primary metabolites (Table 1; Figure 3).   Table 1. Proximate analysis of Chlorococcum infusionum   Figure 3. Profiling of proximate composition in Chlorococcum infusionum  The moisture content in C. infusionum is 8.41±1.37%, ash content is reported to be significantly higher (12.908±0.56), and fat content is 4.12±0.01. The proteins derived from microalgae could function as a broad spectrum of antiviral components to prevent the entry of viruses and their cell replication (Ahmadi et al., 2015). The percentage of protein content in C. infusionum (26.9±0.12%) is slightly more significant than C. humicola (25.5 %), Chlorococcum sp. (11.9%), C. novae-angliae (24.4±0.3%) and the maximum protein content Components in % Chlorococcum infusionum Moisture 8.41±1.37 Ash 12.9±0.56 Fat 4.12±0.01 Fiber 12.00±1.45 Protein 26.9±0.12 Carbohydrate 67.7±0.00 Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  7       under the genus Chlorococcum is stated from C. amblystomatis (48%–56%) (Santhoshkumar et al., 2016; Miao et al., 2016; Correia et al., 2020; Sandgruber et al., 2023). Microalgal polysaccharides are safe, biodegradable, biocompatible, stable and attained prominence, mainly because of their bioactive potentialities such as antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial efficiency (Moreira et al., 2022). C. infusionum (67.7±0.00%) records a higher value of carbohydrates than C. humicola (22.4%); C. amblystomatis (6%–18%); Chlorococcum sp. (49.6%) (Santhoshkumar et al., 2016; Correia et al., 2020; Sandgruber et al., 2023).  Usually, the component of microalgae is endowed with a high value of protein, and the contents of lipids and carbohydrates are fairly low.  In this present study, C. infusionum is witnessed with a high value of carbohydrates (67.7±0.00%) this could be a carbohydrate-rich species (Miao et al., 2016). The variations observed in this study may be attributed to limited environmental factors, such as light intensity, pH level, temperature, and the composition of nutrients in the culture media (Metsoviti et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2021).   Determination of secondary metabolites   The crude extract of C. infusionum confirms the existence of a maximum of eight different phytochemical compounds (alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, glycosides, saponins, coumarins, tannins, and phlorotannins) (Table 2). The qualitative screening of the extract from hexane reveals the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, and tannins. Also, extract from aqueous verifies the presence of flavonoids, phenols and alkaloids.   Table 2.

Therefore, the ethanolic extract has been selected for further analysis and experimentation. The metabolites produced by microalgae vary from fundamental primary metabolites to secondary metabolites. Microalgae synthesize a wide range of bioactive substances such as carotenoids, antioxidants, enzymes, fatty acids, polymers, toxins, peptides, vitamins, and sterols that have the potential for commercial applications. A total of 15,000 potential compounds derived from algae have been chemically characterized and described (Cardozo et al., 2007). Terpenoids, a group of secondary metabolites in higher to lower plants are scientifically verified to possess antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties (Mahato and Sen, 1997). Alkaloids and flavonoids have been proven to possess diverse pharmacological capabilities, such as antiasthma, anticancer, and antimalarial activities (Thawabteh et al., 2019). Saponins have been documented to validate antifungal, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties (Feroz, 2018). Tannins are a polyphenolic compound with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  8       properties (Macakova et al., 2014). Phenols and Coumarin are widely present secondary compounds and have been widely deliberated for their antibacterial and antioxidant activities (Kuda et al., 2005).   Determining functional groups by FTIR analysis  FTIR effectively recognizes the diverse functional groups and compounds that exist naturally in living organisms (Ponnuswamy et al., 2013).  There are large molecules in C. infusionum's FTIR spectrum, including functional groups such as polysaccharides, amino acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, nitriles, alcohol, and amines (Table 3; Figure 4). It was found that the peaks at 3883.28 cm-1, 3617.16 cm-1, 3525.88 cm-1, and 3378.37 cm-1 show the stretching vibrations of O-H and N-H bonds in algae's polysaccharides, amino acids, and proteins (Ponnuswamy et al., 2013; Rotaru et al., 2017; Klecker et al., 2017). The presence of N–H stretch, as indicated by the absorption of the moderate peak at 2926.01 cm-1, suggests the existence of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids in small amounts (Dogan et al., 2007; Rohman et al., 2011; Mellado-Mojica et al., 2017). The observed peak at 2335.80 cm-1 is attributed to the presence of Nitriles, which serve as a foundational molecule for the synthesis of medicines and polymers (Mekki-Berrada et al., 2013; Pramanayakam and Panneerselvam, 2021). The 1631.78 cm-1 peak is triggered by the elongation of the C=O functional group, which may originate from proteins (Dogan et al., 2007; Ponnuswamy et al., 2013). The peak spotted at 1381.03 cm-1 matches the O-H bending vibrations caused by the presence of alcohol (Hemmalakshmi et al., 2017). The prominent peaks observed at 1109.07 cm-1 represent the stretching of C-N bonds in amine groups, which are distinctive features of microalgae containing an abundance of antioxidants (Christou et al., 2017; Azizan et al., 2018). The C–H out-of-plane bending reached its maximum intensity at a wavelength of 693.21 cm-1 due to Benzene derivatives (Mecozzi et al., 2012). The FTIR results of C. infusionum confirm the presence of diverse functional groups that may originate from polysaccharides, amino acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Laurens and Wolfrum (2011) and Satpati et al. (2016) have also observed similar compounds in C. infusionum and Chlorococcum sp., respectively.   Table 3.

Chromatogram of GCMS analysis of Chlorococcum infusionum  Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3. beta.)-, commonly referred to as cholesterol, is a substance that is used in industry as a skin conditioner, emollient, emulsifier, additive, and fragrance. It makes up the largest peak percentage in the ethanolic extract of C. infusionum, reaching 70.33% (Dionisio et al., 2018). 22-dehydrocholesterol is the next most concentrated compound, peaking at 5.21% and showing potential antibacterial properties (EMBL-EBI, 2024).  7-Ketocholesterol (5.12%), a novel cytotoxic agent that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Lyons et al., 1994; Anderson et al., 2020). Furthermore, the present is phytol (3.23%), which is rich in health benefits: it lowers inflammation, combats free radicals, eliminates bacteria, fights cancer, eases allergies, increases urine production, strengthens the immune system, inhibits trypanosomes, lowers cholesterol, and blocks antischistosomal effects (Carvalho et al., 2020). In contrast, stigmasterol (2.75%) has many biological activities, such as killing cells, fighting tumours, reducing inflammation, lowering blood sugar, stopping mutations, lowering cholesterol, and affecting the central nervous system. It can also produce progesterone and corticoids (Kaur et al., 2011). Cholesta-4, 6-dien-3-ol, (3beta)-(1.62%) is an antimicrobial and anti-BACE1 compound. Cholesta-4, 6-dien-3-ol, (3beta)-(1.62%) is an antimicrobial and anti-BACE1 compound (Zhu et al., 2018). It is well known that cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one (1.23%) has antimicrobial properties (Dionisio et al., 2018). 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-OL (1.06%) is well-known for its anticholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antinociceptive, antimicrobial, antidiuretic, and cytotoxic properties (Ryu et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2013; Elufioye et al., 2017; Nithya et al., 2018). As this is happening, 6,10,14-Trimethyl pentadecan-2-one (0.74%) is employed as a fragrance and flavouring ingredient. It may also function as an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antinociceptive agent Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  12       (Avoseh et al., 2021). At a concentration of 0.49%, ethyl heptadecanoate is well known for its capacity to treat intraperitoneal leukaemia in living things. Furthermore, Makgeolli rice wine's chemical and sensory properties are investigated in biological research (Jung et al., 2009; PubChem, 2023). Prior studies on 4,8,12,16-tetramethyl heptadecan-4-olide (0.47%) have examined its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties against free radicals (Rontani et al., 2007). Hexadecanal (0.46%) is a compound that has been shown to have antiviral properties. Men's aggression has been found to decrease when they inhale hexadecanal ((Mishor et al., 2021; PubChem, 2023). The anti-leishmanial property of carbazic acid, 3-(1-propylbutylidene)-, methyl ester (0.63%), is well-known (Shaheen et al., 2020).   Antibacterial activity of Chlorococcum infusionum  The antibacterial impact of C. infusionum was tested against four strains of bacteria using agar well diffusion. Progression of the antibacterial activity was maximum against different bacteria, constructed on the size of the zone of inhibition and it proceeded as follows Ampicillin >E. coli > S. typhi > P. syringae > S. aureus. The functional activities have been detected against the pathogens E. coli (14±0.57 mm) and P. syringae (14±0.57 mm) at the concentration of 75 (µg/mL). Significant findings were observed when the concentration of 25 (µg/mL) was used for testing E. coli (8.33±0.33 mm) and P. syringae (10.5±0.28 mm). Similarly, at a concentration of 50 (µg/mL), P. syringae (11.33±0.66 mm) and E. coli (11±0.57 mm) showed noteworthy results. These results can be found in Table 5 and depicted in Figures 6 and 7.         Table 5.

In 50 µg/mL concentration, the C. infusionum exhibited a considerable zone of inhibition against P. syringae with a zone of inhibition of 11.33±0.57 mm trailed by E. coli (11±0.57 mm), S. typhi (8.16±0.16 mm) and S. aureus (8.3±0.33 mm). In 75 µg/mL, the crude extract of C. infusionum exhibited maximum zone of inhibition against two strains such as E. coli and P. syringae (14±0.57 mm), followed by S. typhi (9.3±0.66 mm) and S. aureus (9±0.57 mm). Similarly, in 100 µg/mL, C. infusionum ethanolic extract inhibited E. coli effectively with the zone of inhibition 17.33±0.33 mm followed by S. typhi (15.3±0.33 mm), P. syringae (15±0.57 mm) and S. aureus (14.3±0.66 mm). Ampicillin inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains (18.16±0.16 mm to 21.66±0.33 mm) (Table 5, Figures 6, 7).   Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  13        Figure 6. Antibacterial effect of C. infusionum: A: S. aureus; B: S. typhi; C: E. coli; D: P. syrin   Figure 7. Graphical representation of the antibacterial activities of C. infusionum shows significant variable among the various concentrations (***p <0.001)  The crude extract by ethanol from Chlorococcum aplanosporum and C. hypnosporum had no antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (Debro & Ward, 1979). The crude extract of Chlorococcum humicola exhibited moderate antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas sp. (6±0.4 mm), E. coli (11±0.25 mm), and S. aureus (14±0.6 mm) (Uma et al., 2011). The extract by methanol of Chlorella vulgaris displayed negative activity against S. aureus in 100 µg/mL concentration, whereas C. reihardtii showed 10 mm. Meanwhile, C. reinhardtii (methanol extract) demonstrated superior activity against P. aeruginosa (19 mm) and E. coli (17 mm) when compared to C. vulgaris, which expressed zones of inhibition of 14 mm and 18 mm, respectively (Jayashree et al., 2016). The antibacterial activity of the intracellular and extracellular ethanol extracts of C. infusionum was investigated, and the results showed that the intracellular extract had moderate antibacterial potential against S. aureus (12 mm) and Bacillus subtilis (11 mm), but no activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa. In contrast, the extracellular Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  14       extract had higher activity against S. aureus (12 mm), B. subtilis (15 mm), E. coli (10 mm), S. typhi (12 mm), and no activity against S. epidermidis and P.aeruginosa (Al-Badri and Al-Ebady 2019). These findings revealed less activity than the current study. The antimicrobial activity of C. minutium showed a significant zone of inhibition (14±0.4 mm), similar to the findings of the current study against S. aureus (Elshobary et al., 2020).  The phytochemical constituents such as 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-OL (1.06%); 6,10,14-Trimethylpentadecan-2-one (0.74%); Phytol (3.23%); Hexadecanal (0.46%); 4,8,12,16-Tetramethylheptadecan-4-olide (0.47%); Cholesta-4,6-dien-3-ol, (3beta)- (1.62%); 22-Dehydrocholesterol (5.21%); Cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one (1.23%) were found in the ethanolic extract of C. infusionum which could be responsible for the antibacterial activities. The type of solvent employed can influence each compound's antimicrobial activity, resulting in greater efficacy (Radhika et al., 2012). Because of differences in bioactive compound solubility, ethanol and methanol extracts are typically less effective at demonstrating antimicrobial activity (Patil et al., 2012). The investigation of antibacterial activity found significant variation (p<0.5, p<0.01, p<0.001) across concentrations and microorganisms. The crude extract of microalgae includes the assembly of numerous active compounds with high efficiency at various concentrations within permissible limits. This is the baseline data for future determinations aimed at optimizing the concentration of antimicrobial activity.  Antioxidant activity of Chlorococcum infusionum The compounds responsible for antioxidant activity strongly claim to protect against oxidative stress and various diseases. Among plant resources, microalgae play an important role in producing flavonoid and phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties (Levasseur et al., 2020). The antioxidant activity of C. infusionum was expressed in 100 µg/mL (26.28±0.36 %) > 50 µg/mL (22.54±0.49 %) > 25 µg/mL (15.35±1.04 %) > 12.5 µg/mL (11.61±0.23 %) > 6.25 µg/mL (9.54±0.23 %) based on the concentration. Table 6 and Figure 8 show anti-oxidant activity (dose-dependent) and its significant variations/differences (p < 0.5, p <0.01, p <0.001) and a consistent progression from minimal concentration to maximum concentration with the higher (100 µg/mL) and lower (6.25 µg/mL) percentage of inhibition (Figure 8).   Table 6. Antioxidant activity of Chlorococcum infusionum Extracts Concentration (µg/ mL) Percentage of  inhibition IC50 (µg/ mL) Ethanol 6.25 9.54±0.23 28.17 ± 1.45 12.5 11.61±0.23 25 15.35±1.04 50 22.54±0.49 100 26.28±0.36 Ascorbic acid 6.25 7.93±0.23 17.65 ± 1.24 12.5 11.70±0.15 25 16.58±0.21 50 20.15±0.32 100 22.96±0.36  Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  15        Figure 8. The antioxidant activity of C. infusionum varies significantly among the different concentrations (***p <0.001) and is shown in Mean ± SEM  The scavenging activity (26.28±0.36%) was found to be maximum at higher concentrations (100 µg/mL). The IC50 value indicates that the ethanolic extract of C. infusionum (28.17 ± 1.45 µg/mL) had strong antioxidant properties, though not as strong as ascorbic acid (17.65 ± 1.24 µg/mL). Uma et al. (2011) evaluated the dose-dependent and significant antioxidant activity from the extracts (methanol and acetone) of Chlorococcum humicola (93%). Kavitha and Palani (2016) estimated the moderately effective antioxidant activity from the ethanol extract of C. humicola (IC50=96.52 µg/mL). The weekly effective ability was observed in the methanol extracts of Chlorella vulgaris and C. reinhardtii (IC50=397.01 µg/mL and 423.44 µg/mL) (Jayashree et al., 2016). The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity of dichloromethane extract (IC50 = 135.39±3.13 µg/mL) of Chlorococcum sp. when compared to ethanol extract (IC50 = 147.40 µg/mL) and n-hexane (IC50 = 183.56± 1.58 µg/mL) extracts of Chlorococcum sp (Olasehinde et al., 2020). In the same way, the ethanolic extracts of C. amblystomatis (IC50 = 58.4 µg/mL) showed stronger antioxidant effects than those of the other Chlorococcum species (Conde et al., 2021). These findings expressed low radical scavenging activity when compared to our present investigation. The DPPH experiment highlights that the ethanolic extract of C. infusionum expressed substantial responses, which would have been caused possibly by the existence of noteworthy phyto-compounds such as Phytol (3.23%), 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-OL (1.06%) and Stigmasterol (2.75%). Several experiments have clarified that methanol extracts of microalgae have robust responses to antioxidant activity due to their capability of forming more oxidized stable conditions (Hemalatha et al., 2013; Elshobary et al., 2020).  Anticancer activity (MTT assay) Cancer is one of the deadliest factors in the lessening of the human population accounting for 8.8 million deaths in 2015 due to the 200 various types of malicious tumours resulting in fatal metastatic consequences (Jayaprakasam et al., 2003; National Cancer Institute, 2023). Hence, devoted and superlative research has been conducted worldwide for novel compounds from various resources to control or cure cancer. Plants-based investigations are very much essential elements to trail the clinical attempts conventionally (Sharif et al., 2014). The potential for anti-malignant activity from microalgae is the ultimate result of numerous cell and molecular research efforts (Cha et al., 2008). Numerous inquiries have been devoted to plant-derived production about cancer activities but, a few number of biological compounds is witnessed from microalgae (Qasem et al., 2016). The anticancerous activity of C. infusionum shows notable observations, arranged as follows: 100 µg/mL Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  16       (84.10±0.56%) > 50 µg/mL (80.67±0.17%) > 25 µg/mL (78.006±0.26%) > 12.5 µg/mL (74.91±0.27%) > 6.25 µg/mL (66.09±0.11%) > 3.125 µg/mL (62.34±0.71%). A gradual rise in concentration is observed, with the lowest level of suppression being 3.125 µg/mL and the maximum inhibition occurring at 100 µg/mL. Table 7 and Figure 9 determine that the anti-cancer activity is dose-dependent and validates significant differences (p < 0.5, p <0.01, p <0.001). C. infusionum (36.12 ± 1.55 µg/mL) showed significant anti-cancerous potentiality, according to the IC50 value, although at a lesser dose than that of standard doxorubicin (16.36 ± 1.21 µg/mL).   Table 7.

Graphical representation of the anticancerous activities of C. infusionum shows significant variable among the different concentrations (***p < 0.001)  The attempts at the anti-cancerous activity of the genus Chlorococcum are sporadic and inattentive. The methanolic extract of Desmococcus olivaceous showed moderate anti-cancerous activity against HeP-2 cell lines with an IC50 value of 0.156 mg/mL (156 µg/mL), while the acetone extract of Chlorococcum humicola exhibited inactive IC50 of 0.625 mg/mL (625 µg/mL). (Uma et al., 2011). Methanolic extracts of Chlorella vulgaris (97.6 µg/mL), Amphora coffeaeformis (114 µg/mL), and Nannochloropsis oculata (50.1 µg/mL) showed moderate Nagabhushana S et al. (2025). Not Sci Biol 17(1):12276  17       cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cell lines (Qasem et al., 2016). Aqueous and methanolic C. humicola extracts inhibited HT-29 cell growth with IC50 values of 50 and 15.62 μg/mL, respectively (Ramaswamy et al., 2020). These findings indicated minimal anticancer activity compared to our studies. Yusof et al., (2006) observed that hot water extract of Chlorella vulgaris effectively inhibited HepG2 liver cell line growth with an IC50 value of 16 µg/mL. Conversely, Salem et al. (2010) reported that the methanolic extract of Chlorella vulgaris exhibited strong cytotoxicity against MCF-7 (15.53 µg/mL) and CaCo-2 (14.63 µg/mL) cell lines respectively. This observation is in order with our results on the effective cytotoxicity of Chlorella vulgaris against HepG-2. Effective cytotoxicity of Chlorella vulgaris (23.45 µg/mL) and C. reinhardtii (46.87 µg/mL) against the cell line MCF-7 was reported by Jayashree et al. (2016). Numerous freshwater microalgae produce metabolites rich in therapeutic compounds, which could be essential in preventing this cancerous illness (Salem et al., 2020). The ethanolic extract of C. infusionum has anti-cancerous activity due to beneficial compounds like ethyl heptadecanoate (0.49%), 3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-OL (1.06%), phytol (3.23%), stigmasterol (2.75%), and 7-Ketocholesterol (5.12%).   Conclusions  The present attempt on Chlorococcum infusionum provides a notable account of the collection, isolation, cultivation and bio-profiling of a culturable freshwater species from Karnataka. The obtained culture results recommend the mass scale culture of this species due to the adaptability to provide the maximum quantity of biomass and the high values of nutrients.  The species has been confirmed to contain therapeutically and economically valuable compounds through FTIR and GCMS analysis, which can be used for various purposes. The bioactive compounds found in this species may be utilized as active components for human health and diets. The ethanol-based extract of this species exhibited a notable antimicrobial effect against pathogens. There is a need for prioritized research to explore innovative biologically known and unknown composites from C. infusionum and their purification strategies through in vivo studies. The antioxidant and anti-cancerous activity also, suggests the bio-potentiality of this species could make a gainable momentum in medical science. The overall outcome of this study reveals that C. infusionum is a promising alternative resource of other microalgae that could be commercialized by standardizing the indoor and outdoor culture methods to increase large-scale productivity in response to the provision of sustainable life from nature.
