Thenatural hybrid T. × josephi-angeli Mansanet & Aguil. is produced in Spain, as its horticultural formsare very popular for domestic uses and gardening. However, its micropropagation and chemicalcomposition have not been studied yet. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to develop amicropropagation procedure for T. × josephi-angeli, and to check whether the in vitro culture had animpact on the chemical profile of the plants. The results showed a high initiation rate (>91%) after twosterilization treatments were applied. Moreover, a micropropagation rate of around 21 new rootedexplants per culture cycle was obtained in treatment M7 (Murashige and Skoog with 0.064 µM 6-(γ,γ-Dimethylallylamino)purine) when compared to the other 10 treatments performed. Acclimatizationwas successful in all three approaches tested (>75%), and all plants kept growing after 4 monthsof outdoor cultivation. Finally, 36 volatiles were identified, and the content of major compoundsremained not statistically different in acclimatized plants when compared to the wild-type plantsaccording to the analyses made by HS-SPME-GC/MS and SPME-GC/MS. This chemical stabilitypoints out the uniformity of the microplants and the suitability of the procedure applied in this studyfor T.×josephi-angeli horticultural production using in vitro techniques.Keywords: in vitro; HS-SPME-GC/MS; micropropagation; phytochemistry; plant growth regulator;SPME-GC/MS; terpene; thyme; thymol; Thymus × josephi-angeli1. IntroductionThe genus Thymus L. (Lamiaceae) is composed of approximately 400 described speciesin the world, with a remarkable diversity in infra-specific taxa and hybrids [1–3]. IberianThymus are of great ethnopharmacological interest, mainly as medicinal plants andspices [4–6], due to their high content of volatile compounds (thymol, carvacrol, etc.)in their essential oils, which have been related to the antimicrobial or antioxidant (amongothers) biological activities of their extracts [7]. Therefore, it is not surprising that ahigh number of genotypes, ecotypes, cultivars, and hybrid forms have been selected, do-mesticated, and produced in nurseries to be commercially exploited as ornamentals andmedicinal plants/spices by the horticultural industry, as well as in the plant extracts andfood technology industries [5,8]. Some examples of popularly used hybrid forms, due totheir ornamental value and richness in specialized metabolites, are T. × citriodorus (Pers.)Schreb. [9–11], T. × oblongifolius Opiz [12], T. × mourae Paiva & Salgueiro [13], and cultivarssuch as T. vulgaris ‘Porlock’ [14], whose chemical constituents have been quite well char-acterized. T. × josephi-angeli Mansanet & Aguil. is a hybrid between T. vulgaris L. subsp.aestivus (Reut.) A. Bolòs & O. Bolòs and T. piperella L. that naturally grows in the ValencianRegion of Spain [1,15]. It has been domesticated and popularized, and its horticulturalHorticulturae 2022, 8, 1188. https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae8121188 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturaeHorticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 2 of 15forms are sold in many parts of the Iberian territory, especially in the Valencian Region, butits chemical composition has not been studied yet.In this regard, in vitro culture techniques (such as micropropagation) are used inhorticulture for massive plant production [16,17], and they are especially interesting forthe production of aromatic species in the case of maintaining the chemical profile of thewild-type donor plants [18,19]. Micropropagation has been applied to a wide array of aro-matic taxa, including the most interesting Thymus species in horticulture. Some examplesare reviewed in Leal et al. [19]. In addition, endemic Iberian species with ethnobotanicaland horticultural interests have been micropropagated, such as pebrella (T. piperella) [20]and cantueso (T. moroderi Pau ex Martínez) [18]. However, published works on the micro-propagation of hybrids with horticultural interests are rather limited, and are completelylacking for T. × josephi-angeli, as well as for information on its chemical composition.Plant hybrids often produce a greater diversity in bioactive specialized metabolites(when compared to parental plants) that result in the generation of elite genotypes withevolutionary advantages, higher resistance to herbivory, or better morphological or growthperformances, as well as higher yields of target chemical compounds [21,22], which jus-tifies the interest for their use in horticulture. For all these reasons, the aim of this workwas to develop an in vitro multiplication protocol of a horticultural, commercial form ofT. × josephi-angeli, as well as to characterize and compare the phytochemical profile of bothin vitro cultured plantlets and wild-type plants, in order to provide new insights on themassive production of these materials for the horticultural industries.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Standards and ReagentsThe reagents used for the in vitro culture experiments included commercial soapEcco-Quimixel (Carlet, Spain), ethanol (VWR Chemicals, Fontenay-sos-Bois, France), acommercial solution of NaOCl (Yunae,-Químicas TJ, Alaquàs, Spain; active chlorine content40 g/L), and Murashige and Skoog basal salts and vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem,The Netherlands). The plant agar and plant growth regulators (6-Benzylaminopurine,6-(γ,γ-Dimethylallylamino)purine, and 3-Indoleacetic) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Barcelona, Spain). For the chemical analyses, methanol (HPLC grade) was suppliedby Scharlau Chemie S.A. (Sentmenat, Spain). The following standards used for the chemicalanalyses were purchased also from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain): α-pinene (CAS 80-56-8);camphene (CAS 79-92-5); α-terpinene (CAS 99-86-5); p-cymene (CAS 99-87-6); D-limonene(CAS 5989-27-5); γ-terpinene (CAS 99-85-4); terpinolene (CAS 586-62-9); linalool (CAS78-70-6); camphor (CAS 76-22-2); endo-borneol (CAS 507-70-0); 4-terpinen-ol (CAS 562-74-3); α-terpineol (CAS 98-55-5); carvacrol (CAS 499-75-2); β-caryophyllene (CAS 87-44-5);humulene (CAS 6753-98-6); and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (CAS 96-76-4).2.2. Plant Sterilization and Culture InitiationThe donor plants (wild-type, WP) were purchased from a greenhouse in Valènciaand kept in outdoor conditions until April 2021. To perform the experiments, healthystems (without symptoms of chlorosis, pathologies, or abnormalities) showing vigorousgrowth were cut and washed with tap water and commercial soap. Then, two surfacesterilization procedures were applied based on the strength and duration of the NaOCltreatment. The first sterilization procedure (S1) consisted of immersion of the stems in a 70%(v/v) ethanol solution for 30 s. Then, the plant materials were immersed in a commercialsolution of NaOCl at 7% (v/v) for 20 min. Finally, three rinses in sterile distilled waterwere performed: the first two washes lasted for 1 min each in order for a faster removalof NaOCl, whereas the last one lasted for 10 min. The second sterilization procedure(S2) also included a first immersion of the stems in 70% ethanol solution (v/v) for 30 s.Then, the stems were transferred to NaOCl at 15% (v/v) for 15 min. Finally, three rinses insterile distilled water were performed as above described. To initiate the in vitro cultures,axillary buds of 0.1–0.2 cm in length were cut and taken as explants. The culture mediumHorticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 3 of 15for initiation consisted of Murashige and Skoog basal salts and vitamins (MS) [23], plus0.088 M sucrose (SU), and 0.021 M plant agar (PA) without plant growth regulators (PGRs).Each explant was sown into one 25 × 150-mm test tube (Auxilab S.L., San Ginés, Spain)and sealed with polypropylene caps containing 15 mL of medium. Conditions for cultureinitiation were as follows: first, cultivation in the dark for 2 days, followed by cultivationfor 30 more days in a 16-h photoperiod of white-daylight illumination (8500 K) provided byT8 Gro-lux fluorescent tubes (Sylvania Lamps, Erlangen, Germany) with photosyntheticallyactive radiation of 50 µmol m−2 s −1. The temperature during the whole experiment wasmaintained at 21 ± 1 ◦C in a culture chamber (EGCS 701 3S-Equitec, Madrid, Spain). Bothsterilization and initiation of in vitro cultures were carried out in an aseptic environmentprovided by a horizontal laminar flow cabinet (AH-100, Burdinola, Bizkaia, Spain). Thesuccess of the sterilization was measured by counting the total contamination (either bybacteria, and/or fungi) versus axenic explants obtained (%), and the initiation success wasevaluated by the total percentage of initiated explants showing growth restoration signsin terms of shoot elongation (in cm) and leaves produced (n◦) after 30 days of culture.From those explants successfully initiated, a selected shoot showing vigorous growth wasmultiplied through several passages in the above described medium and conditions, inorder to obtain a uniform stock of clonal and axenic plant material for further experiments.2.3. Multiplication and RootingMultiplication experiments were based in 11 treatments applied on axillary buds takenfrom the initiated stock and transferred onto fresh MS medium containing 0.088 M SU and0.021 M PA, supplemented or not supplemented with PGRs: the plantlets cultured in the ab-sence of PGRs served as controls (medium M0). The PGR-treated explants were subjected todifferent concentrations of 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP), 6-(γ,γ-Dimethylallylamino)purine(2iP), and 3-Indoleacetic acid (IAA) alone or in combination in the basal medium abovedescribed in order to design media M1-M10. The effects of PGR treatments on the plants’in vitro morphogenesis and development, were assessed after 30 days of in vitro cultureunder the same culture conditions employed in the initiation experiments. The parametersmeasured included the number of newly developed shoots per explant (n◦), shoot elonga-tion (in cm), as well as nodes and leaves formed de novo per explant (n◦). Additionally,the potential micropropagation rate (MR), defined as the number of new explants obtainedafter the cultivation period that can be used in the following in vitro passages to regeneratewhole plantlets, was calculated for each treatment according to the following equation:MR = SN × NN, where SN is the number of newly produced shoots and NN the number ofnew nodes formed per shoot. Finally, rooting was studied by counting the roots produced(n◦) and their elongation (in cm). All media pH for both initiation and multiplicationand rooting were adjusted to 5.75 using solutions of 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N HCl beforeautoclaving for 20 min at 121 ◦C. The explants for rooting and multiplication were sowninto autoclaved food jars containing 150 mL of medium, and sealed with aluminum caps.2.4. AcclimatizationTo assess the acclimatization response of the in vitro produced materials, the micro-propagated and rooted plantlets were planted in polyethylene boxes containing a mixtureof peat moss, as substrate, and vermiculite (5:3 ratio) in order to improve the substrateaeration and moisture retention. Then, the plantlets were subjected to three schemes ofacclimatization ex vitro, based on the duration of the two stages designed: primary acclima-tization (PA) and hardening (HA). PA was performed in a culture room at 22 ◦C, a 12-hphotoperiod, and 90–100% relative humidity (HR). For HA, a gradual reduction of the RHwas done by opening one or two windows on the lid of the boxes, and finally removingthe lid. The three acclimatization schemes performed included: (1) 30 day PA followed by30 day HA (AC1), (2) 30 day PA followed by 15 day HA (AC2), and (3) 15 day PA followedby 15 day HA (AC3). After each stage, the percentage of surviving plants was recorded.Horticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 4 of 15Finally, the plants were transferred to open field conditions, watered once a week, and thepercentage of survival after 4 months was also recorded.2.5. Plant Extraction and Chemical AnalysesThe content of terpenes was studied for WT, acclimatized plants, as well as for thoseplantlets from in vitro treatments that showed the highest levels of plant developmentaccording to the multiplication and rooting experiments (M0 and M7). Plant samples weredried in the dark at room temperature conditions (≈22 ◦C). After drying, three replicates ofa sample of 0.02 g from the plant material were subjected to two complementary chemicalanalyses as explained beneath. The plant extraction method and analytical methodologieswere based on previous studies performed by the research group on similar chemicalcompounds [24–26].Firstly, a solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) with subsequent analysis by gas chro-matography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using the headspace (HS) techniquewas performed. In this approach, the chemical characterization of the sample is direct,and extraction is not necessary because the analyses are based on the emission of plantvolatile compounds. The samples were prepared as follows: 0.02 g of leaves was driedand pulverized. Then, the plant material was placed in a glass vial and subjected to heat-ing and agitation with the SPME fiber. The volatile compounds adsorbed by the fiberwere then analysed by GC/MS. This methodology allowed the qualitative determinationof volatile terpenes present in plants, as the identification is not affected by the solvent,when compared to the analyses performed on plant extracts. Estimations of the content ofphytochemicals were made through the calculation of percentage of peak area (% PA).Secondly, 0.02 g of dried plant samples was extracted in 4 mL of 80% methanol (v/v)in test tubes. Tubes were then incubated for 30 min in an ultrasonic bath, and the extractsobtained were finally filtered (0.45 mm) and stored at 4 ◦C until analyzing by SPME-GC/MS.This approach allowed the quantification of the identified compounds to be carried out bymeans of an external standard calibration and, when combined with HS-SPME-GC/MS, itallows a better understanding of the chemical composition of plants.Identification of volatile metabolites was carried out by using the spectra librarypresent in the software NIST Chemistry WebBook. A total of 19 compounds were quantifiedusing the 14 terpene standards stated in Section 2.1. Mix solutions of standards wereprepared using methanol 80% in a range of concentrations and injected into SPME-GS/MSusing the same chromatographic conditions as the samples. Detected compounds werequantified using the corresponding standards. In absence of corresponding standards, asimilar compound was used for quantification.2.6. Experimental Design and Data TreatmentFor the initiation experiments, a variable amount of 30–85 explants were used in thedifferent trials performed per treatment and replicate. The multiplication and rootingexperiments were set up using three replicates per treatment, containing ten explants each(n = 30). For the acclimatization experiments, three replicates containing twelve explantseach were used (n = 36). All these experiments were performed in triplicate in orderto assure the uniformity and reproducibility of the results. The statistical treatment ofthe results was done using the free software “Infostat” (National University of Córdoba,Argentina; https://www.infostat.com.ar/ (accessed on 25 April 2022)). Group analyseswere carried out by ANOVA, and significant differences were revealed by using the Fisher’sLeast Significant Difference Test (LSD) at 95% confidence (α = 0.05).3. Results3.1. Plant Sterilization and Culture InitiationThe sterilization procedures applied in this study resulted in an explant survival ratehigher than 91% for both treatments (not statistically different among them). In addition,the parameters measured to assess the growth restoration (shoot elongation and leavesHorticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 5 of 15produced) did not show significant differences among them after 30 days of culture. Finally,contamination percentage (proliferation of bacteria and/or fungi during the initiationperiod) remained lower than 15% in both procedures (Table 1).Table 1. Sterilization procedures applied to axillary bud explants of Thymus × josephi-angeli Mansanet& Aguil. donor plants. The shoot elongation, number of produced leaves, and the percentage ofexplants that restored growth (mean ± SD) or became contaminated are shown for each treatmentafter 32 days of cultivation on a medium of Murashige and Skoog basal salts and vitamins [23]at a temperature of 21 ± 1 ◦C. Mean values within a column followed by the same letter are notsignificantly different by Fisher’s LSD test (α = 0.05).Treatment Shoot Elongation(cm)Leaves Produced(n◦)Growth Restoration(%)Contamination(%)S1 (30 s EtOH 70% + 20 min NaOCl 7%) 1.88 ± 0.39 a 9.31 ± 0.30 a 91.50 ± 5.34 a 12.78 ± 3.09 aS2 (30 s EtOH 70% + 15 min NaOCl 15%) 1.92 ± 0.45 a 8.73 ± 0.65 a 91.29 ± 6.87 a 14.66 ± 4.16 a3.2. Multiplication and RootingThe results obtained after 30 days of in vitro multiplication using 11 combinationsof PGRs showed that treatment M7 (0.064 µM 2iP) gave significantly higher performance(p < 0.01) for all morphogenic parameters measured (number of shoots formed per explant,shoot elongation, newly formed nodes, leaves and roots formed per explant, and rootlength) when compared to the other 10 treatments (Table 2; Figure 1). Moreover, M0(without PGRs) offered suboptimal micropropagation results that were not statisticallydifferent to the M7 treatment for shoot elongation and number of newly formed leavesand roots (Table 2). Shoot elongation and root elongation decreased with the increase incytokinin concentrations in an almost dose-dependent manner (especially for treatmentsbased solely on 2iP), whereas the new shoots, nodes, and leaves formed per explant showeda more irregular trend. Attending to the micropropagation rate, treatment M7 gave thehighest value, approximately 21 new explants for each passage in vitro, in accordance withthe optimal values obtained from the morphogenic parameters measured. The treatmentM1 showed the second highest micropropagation rates (9.31 explants), but rooting was nilin this treatment (Figure 1).Table 2.

Plant Extraction and Chemical AnalysesA total of 36 volatile compounds were identified by HS-SPME-GC/MS. The mostabundant compounds according to percentage of peak area were p-cymene, γ-terpinene,thymol, and β-caryophyllene for all wild-type, in vitro cultured, and acclimatized plants(Table 4). Although significant differences in the peak area were detected in in vitro culturedplants for p-cymene and β-caryophyllene, no significant differences were found betweenthe percentages of peak area in acclimatized plant samples when compared to the wild typeplants for the four major compounds identified by HS-SPME-GC/MS (Figures 2 and 3).Table 4.

Discussion The two sterilization procedures applied in the present work did not show significant differences between them according to the parameters measured (shoot elongation and leaves produced), but provided more than 91% growth restoration and proliferation of microorganisms lower than 15%, thus showing their suitability for the initiation of the explants. Similar procedures, combining short immersion in ethanol followed by longer dipping in diluted bleach (10–20%), are frequently reported to be successful for in vitro initiation of nodal explants developed in young shoots from woody plants [27,28]. However, high contamination rates and low growth restoration (with the subsequent unsuccessful or difficult initiation of in vitro culture) are also reported for these type of starting materials [18], which makes it quite difficult to standardize a general approach for explants taken from shoots, and makes it necessary to test specifically the sterilization procedures in every in vitro assay. Once the cultures were initiated and a stock of clonal and axenic plants was obtained, the in vitro multiplication and rooting of the T. × josephi-angeli form was studied under 11 PGR-based treatments. In these experiments, shoot and root elongation decreased with the increase in cytokinin concentrations in an almost dose-dependent manner (Table 2). These are the expected results due to the suppression of apical dominance as the cytokinin concentrations were increased in the culture media [29]. However, the number of new shoots produced per explant did not show the expected inverse trend (derived from lateral bud development as a consequence of the apical dominance suppression), as treatments having higher cytokinin concentrations did not produce a significantly higher number of shoots when compared to the other media and the untreated controls (for example, treatment M6), or the response was even significantly lower (treatment M10). In the present work, treatments consisting of the lowest cytokinin concentrations (M1 and M7) produced a higher number of new shoots per explant when compared to the untreated controls, and M7 (low cytokinin concentration) also when compared to those Figure 3.

Similar procedures, combining short immersion in ethanol followed by longerdipping in diluted bleach (10–20%), are frequently reported to be successful for in vitro ini-tiation of nodal explants developed in young shoots from woody plants [27,28]. However,high contamination rates and low growth restoration (with the subsequent unsuccessfulor difficult initiation of in vitro culture) are also reported for these type of starting materi-als [18], which makes it quite difficult to standardize a general approach for explants takenfrom shoots, and makes it necessary to test specifically the sterilization procedures in everyin vitro assay.Once the cultures were initiated and a stock of clonal and axenic plants was obtained,the in vitro multiplication and rooting of the T. × josephi-angeli form was studied under11 PGR-based treatments. In these experiments, shoot and root elongation decreased withthe increase in cytokinin concentrations in an almost dose-dependent manner (Table 2).These are the expected results due to the suppression of apical dominance as the cytokininconcentrations were increased in the culture media [29]. However, the number of newshoots produced per explant did not show the expected inverse trend (derived from lateralbud development as a consequence of the apical dominance suppression), as treatmentshaving higher cytokinin concentrations did not produce a significantly higher numberof shoots when compared to the other media and the untreated controls (for example,Horticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 10 of 15treatment M6), or the response was even significantly lower (treatment M10). In the presentwork, treatments consisting of the lowest cytokinin concentrations (M1 and M7) produceda higher number of new shoots per explant when compared to the untreated controls,and M7 (low cytokinin concentration) also when compared to those treatments havinghigher cytokinin concentrations. Attending to the type of cytokinin, treatments based solelyon 2iP showed, generally, significantly higher morphogenic response for the new shootformation, shoot elongation, as well as nodes and leaves production when compared totreatments based on BAP or combinations of BAP and 2iP (Table 2). From the physiologicalpoint of view, it is normally assumed that BAP and its conjugates are more stable, andactive cytokinins more than 2iP [30,31], as the first ones are not degraded by cytokininoxidases [30]. Therefore, BAP constitutes the mainly chosen PGR for in vitro multiplica-tion [32]. The exogenous application of BAP provided optimal morphogenic results inLamiaceae such as in the genera Clerodendrum L. [33], Sideritis L. [34,35], Mentha L. [36–38],and Thymus L. [19,20,39], although comparisons with 2iP were not made in these works. Insome other works carried out in this botanical family, BAP was demonstrated to performbetter than 2iP, and examples are found in Satureja L. [40], Mentha × piperita [41], andTeucrium capitatum L. [42]. In contrast to all this, other works showed that 2iP-treated plantsperformed a higher in vitro multiplication response when compared to other cytokininssuch as BAP, as we obtained in the present work. Examples of this can be found for T. vul-garis [40] or Sideritis leucantha Cav. subsp. leucantha [27]. In this regard, Marco-Medinaand Casas [18] also reported optimal morphogenic performance in medium without PGRsfor T. moroderi, indicating the sensitivity of these explants to the exogenously appliedPGRs, although they did not test 2iP. In addition, it is reported that BAP induced highpercentages of vitrified shoots in T. lotocephalus G.López & R.Morales [43]. All these resultssuggest certain sensitivity of some species of Lamiaceae to relatively high concentrations ofcytokinins, particularly BAP, during the regeneration process in vitro. In plants, cytokininsenhance the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thus having an impact on thecell-cycle progression, which ultimately regulates the new tissue formation and morpho-genesis [44,45]. 2iP is a naturally occurring cytokinin in plants that has almost 10 times lessaffinity than BAP for the CRE1/AHK4 cytokinin receptor, as described in Arabidopsis [46].This would explain why BAP is generally seen as a more active cytokinin than 2iP [30,31].However, particularities in the different cytokinin perception by the plant cells and signaltransduction at the molecular level by a differential genetic expression might be associatedwith a wide array of factors. For instance, Herrera-Isidron et al. [47] recently proposeddifferential cytokinin perception depending on certain developmental events during theorganogenesis in potatoes. In addition, it is still not clear whether cytokinin signaling takesplace from one or more than one site at the cellular level (endoplasmic reticulum and/orplasma membrane), if the action is equal in all tissues or if it depends on the tissue, itsdevelopmental stage, and/or the action of signalling molecules from different origins [48],or if synergies exist between endogenous levels of hormones and exogenously appliedPGRs [49]. Therefore, how exogenously applied BAP and 2iP (among other cytokinins)might act at the cellular or tissue level, and how this interaction is specifically translated intomorphogenesis in vitro for different genotypes or plant species, cannot be stated. In anycase, it seems reasonable to think that there is a certain sensitivity to BAP in some membersof Lamiaceae, including the hybrid subject of this work, and, for those cases, alternative ex-ogenously applied cytokinins (such as 2iP) at low concentrations offer higher morphogenicresponses. This fact strongly contrasts to what is widely reported for other plant familiessuch as Amaryllidaceae, where optimal developmental parameters are achieved with BAPat higher concentrations (>6 µM BAP) than in many Lamiaceae [50–53]. The optimal rootdevelopment and elongation were achieved during the multiplication phase in treatmentsM7 and M0. As both shooting and rooting are developed in parallel during the sameculture passage, it is not necessary to perform a specific rooting stage for the micropropa-gation of T. × josephi-angeli, unlike what is reported for Thymus species [20], among otherLamiaceae [27], which constitutes a clear advantage for its commercial production.Horticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 11 of 15From the horticultural point of view, it is certainly more interesting to obtain a greaternumber of new explants after one culture cycle (as they can be easily rooted and acclimatedex vitro) rather than solely new shoots per explant. Therefore, the micropropagationrate (MR) was defined in the present work as the number of new explants obtained afterthe cultivation period that can be used in the following in vitro passages to regeneratewhole plantlets (number of newly produced shoots x the number of new nodes formed pershoot). In this sense, treatment M7 (2iP = 0.064 µM) also showed optimal results, as themicropropagation rate was almost 21 new explants to be used in the following subcultures(or directly rooted and acclimatized), more than double when compared to the second besttreatment (M1, BAP = 6.57 µM, micropropagation rate = 9.31). The results obtained duringthe in vitro cultivation, the morphogenic performance, and the acclimatization success arecomparable to the results reported for other Thymus species, including the parental speciesof T. × josephi-angeli, T. vulgaris and T. piperella [19,20], thus showing the suitability of theprocedure applied in this study for the horticultural industries.The chemical analyses performed by HS-SPME-GC/MS allowed the identificationof 36 volatile compounds in the samples of T. × josephi-angeli. According to this tech-nique, the major compounds, in descending order, were thymol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene,carvacrol, linalool, thymoquinone, and β-caryophyllene, where solely thymol constitutedaround 60% (peak area) of the volatiles in all samples screened (wild-type, in vitro cultured,and acclimatized), whereas the other six compounds ranged from 1.5% to 10% of peakarea. The SPME-GC/MS analyses of the extracts and terpene quantification confirmedmost of the qualitative results on volatiles obtained in the direct measurements made byHS-SPME-GC/MS. To combine both approaches allowed a better understanding of thevolatile composition of the plant extracts. Both methods revealed thymol as the majorcomponent, by far, being six times more abundant than the second one. In addition, resultson p-cymene, γ-terpinene, and β-caryophyllene (major components in these plant samples)are in agreement in both approaches. However, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol was revealed asthe second most abundant compound in methanol extracts analyzed by SPME-GC/MS(with concentrations around 100 µg/g), but this compound could not be identified by HS-SPME-GC/MS. This fact is most likely due to the inability of the fiber to adsorb (and detect)this compound at the given heating temperature in the HS-SPME-GC/MS technique. Incontrast, the use of methanol at 80% (v/v) allowed its extraction and further identificationand quantification. In line with this, carvacrol, linalool, and thymoquinone were identifiedby HS-SPME-GC/MS, but these compounds were not confirmed in the methanol extractsaccording to the analyses made by SPME-GC/MS. In any case, both approaches agreedfor the major compounds, with thymol as the most abundant in T. × josephi-angeli samples.Thymol is also the most abundant terpene in T. vulgaris [54], and it constitutes the secondmost abundant component (after p-cymene) in the T. piperella chemotypes from the centralcounties of the Valencian Region [55], where the commercial hybrid is produced. Therefore,the results obtained in the chemical analyses performed in this work also point out thehybrid origin of T. × josephi-angeli, between T. vulgaris and T. piperella, as is describedfor morphological characters in the original description of the hybrid [15]. The cultureconditions during the in vitro regeneration processes may have an impact on the compo-sition of volatile compounds of aromatic plants [17,56]. Among the major compoundsscreened in the present work, thymol and γ-terpinene showed an increase in their contentduring the in vitro culture, whereas p-cymene and β-caryophyllene contents decreased.This is in line with the preliminary results that we performed on this commercial form ofT. × josephi-angeli [57]. In the present work, these changes were only significant in the casesof p-cymene (treatments M0 and M7) and β-caryophyllene (M7). However, the content ofthese volatiles was restored after the ex vitro transference of the plantlets, and remained notstatistically different in acclimatized plants (cultivated in outdoor conditions for 4 months)when compared to the wild-type plants. Moreover, according to the determinations madeby SPME-GC/MS analyses of the extracts, the chemical profile and relative amounts ofthe identified compounds do not vary among wild-type and acclimatized plants (Table 4).Horticulturae 2022, 8, 1188 12 of 15This chemical stability points out the uniformity of the microplants produced using theapproach presented in this study. Given the commercial importance of Thymus in thehorticultural industry [19] and the high-added value of thymol (the most abundant terpenein T. × josephi-angeli) in several fields of applications [54], the results obtained in the presentwork highlight the suitability of the in vitro culture techniques not only for the industrialproduction of T. × josephi-angeli as a commercial plant with interests as ornamentals ordomestic spices and medicinal plants, but also to provide high-added value materials forthe plant extracts industry.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, a satisfactory procedure of in vitro propagation for T. × josephi-angeliplants is presented here. The initiation of explants in axenic conditions was successful (>91%growth restoration) after sterilization, consisting of dipping explants in 70% (v/v) ethanolfor 30 s, followed by immersion in NaOCl either at 7% (v/v) for 20 min or at 15% (v/v) for15 min. The highest morphogenic capacity was obtained in medium MS with 0.064 µM 2iP,showing significantly higher values of shoot and root elongation, as well as number of newshoots, nodes, leaves, and roots produced per explant, with an optimal micropropagationrate of 21 new explants produced per culture cycle. Rooted explants were obtained duringthe multiplication phase, and acclimatization was successful (>75%) by transferring themicroplants to a sterile soil mixture of peat moss and vermiculite (5:3 ratio) in all threeapproaches tested. The chemical analyses performed allowed the identification of 36 volatilecompounds, and thymol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, and β-caryophyllene constituted themajor compounds according to the determinations made by HS-SPME-GC/MS and SPME-GC/MS, where thymol was the most abundant (≈60% peak area and concentrations around500 µg/g). The content of these compounds is not significantly different in acclimatizedplants when compared to wild-type plants, which points out the uniformity of the plantsproduced in vitro. Finally considered, the results presented in this study constitute the firstones on tissue culture and phytochemistry of T. × josephi-angeli. These results are of greatinterest not only due to the scientific novelty and the multiple interests of the hybrid taxonhere studied, but also due to the potential application of this approach to produce uniformand thymol-rich plants for the horticultural and plant extracts industries.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, E.A. and J.J.-V.; methodology, E.A. and J.J.-V.; formalanalysis, R.d.M.J.-M. and J.J.-V.; investigation, E.A., R.d.M.J.-M. and J.J.-V.; data curation, E.A.,R.d.M.J.-M. and J.J.-V.; writing—original draft preparation, J.J.-V.; writing—review and editing, E.A.and J.J.-V.; supervision, J.J.-V.; project administration, J.J.-V.; funding acquisition, J.J.-V.
