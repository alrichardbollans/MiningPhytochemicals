Abstract: Here we report the first experiments
testing reciprocal effects between the bark beetle-
associated yeast, Ogataea pini, and phytochemicals
present in tree tissues (Pinus ponderosa). We tested
two hypotheses: (i) tree phytochemicals mediate O.
pini growth and (ii) O. pini affects chemical
composition of plant tissues. We tested six monoter-
penes on O. pini biomass growth in vitro and found
that most monoterpenes inhibited O. pini growth;
however mean O. pini biomass increased 21.5% when
treated with myrcene and 75.5% when treated with
terpinolene, relative to control. Ogataea pini was
grown on phloem tissue ex vivo to determine whether
O. pini affected phloem chemistry. Monoterpene
concentrations declined in phloem over time, but
phloem colonized by O. pini had significantly
different concentrations of monoterpenes at two
periods than phloem with no yeast. After 7 d, when
O. pini was present, concentrations of the monoter-
pene D-3-carene was 42.9% lower than uncolonized
phloem and concentrations of the monoterpene
terpinolene was 345.0% higher than uncolonized
phloem. After 15 d phloem colonized by O. pini had
505.4% higher concentrations of a-pinene than
uncolonized phloem. These experiments suggest that
O. pini responds to phytochemicals present in host
tissues and the presence of O. pini might alter the
chemical environment of phloem tissues during the
early stages of beetle development. The interactions
between O. pini and phytochemicals in pine vascular
tissues might have consequences for the bark beetle
that vectors O. pini, Dendroctonus brevicomis.

INTRODUCTION
Davis et al. (2010) found that the ascomycetous yeast
Ogataea pini (Saccharomycetales: Saccharomycetace-
ae) was present in the fungal transport structures
(thoracic mycangia) of 56% of female western pine
beetle Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte. This fre-
quency of association has been consistent for at least
50 y and across large geographic regions (Shifrine
and Phaff 1956). The fidelity of this association
implicates O. pini as a consistent symbiont in the D.
brevicomis system. Ogataea pini establishes rapidly
when compared with the filamentous fungal symbi-
onts of Dendroctonus beetles and could dispropor-
tionately influence the incipient stages of tree
colonization relative to slower growing filamentous
fungi (Six and Wingfield 2011). Although a frequent
association between O. pini and D. brevicomis origi-
nally was demonstrated by Shifrine and Phaff (1956)
nearly 60 y before, the role played by O. pini in the D.
brevicomis community remains poorly understood.
Experimental research regarding yeast species in
bark beetle symbiont assemblages thus far has been
restricted solely to the effects of volatile organic
compounds produced by yeasts (Hunt and Borden
1990, Adams et al. 2008, Davis et al. 2010). Here we
report the first test of interactions between the yeast
O. pini and phytochemicals that are present in the
primary host tree, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa),
of the western pine beetle, D. brevicomis. Dendroctonus
brevicomis colonizes the vascular tissue of ponderosa
pine (Wood 1982). Oleoresin exudation is a primary
physiological response when healthy pine vascular
tissues are damaged by invading organisms (Raffa and
Smalley 1995). Thus O. pini vectored by the beetle
must survive in a phytochemically saturated environ-
ment. The microbial associates of some Dendroctonus
beetles are known to be highly sensitive to chemical
variation in the environment (Paine and Hanlon
1994; Hofstetter et al. 2005, 2007), and the phyto-
chemical variation previously described in host pine
trees (Latta et al. 2000, 2003) creates a potential
interface for interactions to occur between host tree
tissues and O. pini.
Our objectives were to test the effects of chemical
components of oleoresins of Pinus ponderosa on O.
pini isolated from D. brevicomis and to determine
whether the presence of O. pini affects the secondary
chemistry of tree vascular tissues. We tested two
hypotheses: (i) host monoterpenes mediate the

growth of O. pini and (ii) the presence of O. pini in
phloem (vascular tissue) influences chemical compo-
sition of phloem. We tested the effects of six
monoterpenes on O. pini biomass growth in vitro
and found that some monoterpenes inhibited O. pini
growth but two monoterpenes stimulated growth. We
also tested the effect of O. pini on the monoterpene
composition of phloem tissue in ex vivo assays. We
found that monoterpenes degrade over time in
phloem tissue but inoculation with O. pini signifi-
cantly affected concentrations of monoterpenes in
phloem tissues over time relative to yeast-free phloem.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of O. pini from D. brevicomis.—Ogataea pini was
isolated from the fungal transport structures (mycangia) of
live D. brevicomis females as described in Davis et al. (2010).
Live D. brevicomis were collected from Lindgren funnel
traps baited with enhanced western pine beetle pheromone
lures (Synergy Semiochemicals Corp, P130 Lot
No. WPP10416). Traps were placed in forested areas
dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in
northern Arizona, USA, at 2100–2200 m. Beetles were live-
trapped and placed individually into clear, size 0 gelatin
capsules (Torpac, Lot No. 1100049271) and stored in the
lab in dark environmental chambers at 5 C until used for
microbial isolations. Beetles were held fewer than 24 h
before dissection, and only live female beetles were
dissected. We dissected only female beetles because males
do not exhibit mycangia in this species. All insects used for
isolation of O. pini were collected 18 May 2009–18 Jun 2009.
Effect of monoterpenes on Ogataea pini growth.—We chose
to assay biomass of O. pini instead of optical density (OD)
or colony forming units (CFUs) because of the high
repeatability and reduced variability of biomass measure-
ments. In addition biomass provides a direct estimate of
colony size and performance. Before experimental assays
the growth function for O. pini biomass was determined in
1.5% malt extract broth (MEB; Difco, Lot No. 7306921).
This was done so that the effect of monoterpene treatments
could be assessed experimentally at a single time. We chose
to use liquid media because it is consistently and easily
separated from yeast biomass. The pH of MEB media was
4.7 6 0.2, and the pH of the natural substrate (ponderosa
pine phloem) was 4.5 (Elkinton et al. 1981). Three isolates
of O. pini were chosen randomly and stock cultures were
created by inoculating 100 mL MEB with 10 mL O. pini cell
culture in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks. Flasks were placed on a
platform shaker (Excella E1) at 15% maximum speed
(70 rpm.) and incubated in the dark 24 h at 25 C. Sterile
scintillation vials containing 10 mL MEB were inoculated
with 100 mL volumes of each stock culture (dilution factor of
1022). Seven vials were made for each O. pini isolate, and
vials were incubated in the dark at 25 C on the platform
shaker, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 h. This was replicated twice
for each isolate. After incubation vials containing O. pini
culture and MEB were centrifuged at 20 000 rpm (22 C,
Sorvall RC2-B) 5 min (modified from Zheng et al. 2005). A
pipette was used to remove the supernatant from the cell
pellet left in each vial. We washed yeast cells with purified
deionized water, centrifuged vials at 20 000 rpm and again
removed the supernatant from the cell pellet. Vials were
placed in drying ovens at 70 C for 24 h. Total biomass
growth for each replicate at each period was determined by
subtracting the vial weight before inoculation from the vial
weight following removal from drying ovens. Vials were
accurately weighed to 1 3 1022 mg. Voucher specimens of
O. pini were preserved in 20% glycerol/80% malt extract
broth (Difco, Lot No. 7306921) and placed in 280 C
storage freezers in the Center for Microbial Genetics and
Genomics in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA (Davis et al. 2010).
We experimentally tested the effect of monoterpenes onO.
pini growth with the above technique, except that 15
randomly chosen isolates were used and three subsamples
were performed for each isolate. Treatment consisted of
amending vials containing 10 mL MEB/100 mL O. pini stock
culture with monoterpenes at a ratio of 5% by volume.
Monoterpene concentration can be 0.5–30% of phloem mass
(Klepzig et al. 1995, Raffa and Smalley 1995) and 20–40% in
resin (Klepzig et al. 1995, Hofstetter et al. 2005), and test
chemical concentrations of 5% have been used in studies of
similar ecological systems (Wallin and Raffa 2000, Eckhardt et
al. 2009). Controls consisted of 100 mL O. pini stock culture/
10 mL MEB with no monoterpenes added. Each replicate was
incubated 30 h in the dark on a platform shaker (70 rpm) at
25 C. Because monoterpenes are insoluble in MEB contin-
uous agitation of growth media ensured that monoterpenes
were distributed homogenously in growth media. Relative
biomass was determined by dividing the biomass for each
individual replicate treated with monoterpenes by the mean
control biomass for each isolate. Monoterpenes used in the
experiment are listed below and were obtained from these
commercial sources: ACROS Organics (New Jersey): (1R)-(+)
a-pinene (98%), (1S)-(2) b-pinene (98%), stabilized D-3-
carene (90%), stabilized myrcene (90%), (+) limonene
(97%); and Fluka (Japan): terpinolene (. 85%).
The effect of O. pini on phloem chemistry.—Ogataea pini was
grown ex vivo on phloem collected from P. ponderosa to
determine whether the presence of O. pini in phloem tissue
affects phytochemical (monoterpene) composition over
time (Klepzig et al. 1995). Phloem tissue was collected by
felling a healthy ponderosa pine in the same stand from
which D. brevicomis were obtained, scraping off the bark
with a draw blade and peeling the phloem from the tree
with sterile filet knives and placing it in sterile airtight bags.
Phloem tissue was collected from the same position along
the bole of a single tree. Phloem tissue was taken to the lab
and punched into 2.5 cm diam disks with a sterilized No. 16
punch (C.S. Osborne, Texas). The phloem was approxi-
mately 3 mm thick. Phloem disks were inoculated directly
with 10 mL O. pini cell culture and placed on water agar in
60 3 15 mm Petri dishes (Fisherbrand) with the side of the
disk containing cell culture inverted so as to be facing
downward into the water agar. A total of 76 disks were cut,
28 inoculated with O. pini and 48 that were not inoculated
(control).
1202 MYCOLOGIA
Twenty of the inoculum-free disks were analyzed at 0 d.
After 7 d half the inoculated phloem disks (n 5 14) and
half the control disks (n 5 14) were removed from the
water agar and cut into 0.5 3 0.5 mm squares with a
sterile razorblade under laminar flow (Klepzig et al. 1995,
Raffa and Smalley 1995). An extract of each phloem disk
was prepared for gas chromatography by submerging the
cut phloem tissues in 10 mL hexane in a 20 mL glass vial.
Each vial was allowed to incubate at room temperature
24 h. This was repeated with the remaining replicates at
15 d. Vials were frozen at 220 C until analyzed by gas
chromatography.
Gas chromatography conditions.—One gram of each extract
was dissolved in hexane (GC grade, . 99.0%) to a total
volume of 2.0 mL. Subsequently 50 mL dissolved extract
again was diluted to 5 mL with GC grade hexane and 50 mL
9480 mg/L fenchone, the internal standard, was added.
The same concentration of fenchone also was added to the
standards. Six calibration standards, each with increasing
concentrations of monoterpenes (a-pinene, b-pinene,
myrcene, carene, limonene and terpinolene), were pre-
pared along with two check standards. All standards were
created from a stock solution that contained highly pure
monoterpenes dissolved in GC-grade hexane. All samples
and standards were transferred to 2 mL vials with ivory
PTFE/red rubber septa.
A Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph
(GC) with a 6890 series auto-sampler injector and a 100-vial
tray was used for the analysis of the extracts. The system uses
on-column injection and a flame ionization detector (FID).
A J&W Scientific capillary GC column was used. It is a DB-1
column, 30 m long, with 0.25 mm internal diameter and
film 0.25 mm thick. The column was heated to 300 C for 1 h
before the start of analysis to remove residues. These
parameters were used: Helium flow through column:
20 mL/min, Hydrogen for FID: 30 ml/min, compressed
air for FID: 370 mL/min, and nitrogen (FID auxiliary gas):
10 mL/min. The injector was kept at 275 C and the detector
at 300 C for the entire run.
SRI Instruments peak simple model 202 data system and
software was used to acquire the FID signal from the GC and
draw chromatograms. Monoterpenes were identified by
retention time. This software identifies each peak within a
defined window of expected retention time. Calibration
curves were created for each monoterpene by plotting the
corrected peak area (area of the monoterpene peak divided
by the area of the fenchone peak for that sample) versus the
known monoterpene concentration for each calibration
standard. This calibration curve was used to determine the
monoterpene concentration in each diluted sample. A
duplicate and a check standard were analyzed every 10
samples, and all results were found to be repeatable. The
original mass of the sample extract and dilution factor were
accounted for so that results are reported as milligrams of
each monoterpene per milliliter extract.
Statistical analyses.—All statistical analyses were performed
with the software JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute), and all tests
incorporate a type I error rate of a 5 0.05. Ogataea pini
growth rates were log-transformed to conform to assump-
tions of normality before hypothesis testing. The growth
curve for O. pini was established by fitting a logarithmic
growth function to the transformed response of O. pini
biomass to time (h).
The effect of host monoterpenes on O. pini isolates was
tested with one-way ANOVA with monoterpene treatment
(n 5 6) as a fixed effect on the response of mean O. pini
biomass (mg) after 30 h. A Tukey HSD test was used to
separate means. To analyze variation in monoterpene
concentrations between phloem colonized by O. pini and
uncolonized phloem a nested one-way ANOVA was used
with O. pini presence as the treatment, nested by period
(7 d, 15 d) on the response of mean concentration
(mg/mL) of the six monoterpenes. We did not include
the results from the 20 disks that were analyzed at 0 d in the
statistical analysis because tissues analyzed at 0 d were not
inoculated with O. pini. However the monoterpene
concentrations from disks at 0 d are included in the display
of results for baseline comparison because monoterpene
concentrations decline over time.
RESULTS
Effect of monoterpenes on O. pini growth.—From our
preliminary biomass growth assays O. pini achieved
maximum biomass in 10 mL MEB at 30 h after
inoculation into MEB at a dilution factor of 1022, and
this relationship followed a logarithmic growth
function (FIG. 1). As a result O. pini was incubated
30 h during experiments testing the growth response
of O. pini to host monoterpenes.
Amendment of MEB with host monoterpenes
significantly affected biomass growth of 15 isolates
of O. pini after 30 h (whole model: F5,249 5 23.39, P
, 0.0001). Four of the six monoterpenes inhibited
O. pini growth relative to control (no monoter-
penes): media amended with (1R)—(+) a-pinene
reduced O. pini biomass growth by 53.6% on average;
(1S)—(2) b-pinene reduced O. pini biomass growth
by 54.4% on average; D-3-carene reduced O. pini
biomass growth by 37.7% on average; and (+)
limonene inhibited growth of O. pini by 41.9% on
average. In contrast amendments with myrcene and
terpinolene stimulated O. pini biomass growth by
21.5% and 75.5% relative to control respectively
(FIG. 2).
The effect of O. pini on phloem chemistry.—Monoter-
pene concentrations declined rapidly in phloem
tissues over time; however tissues inoculated with O.
pini had significantly different concentrations of
some monoterpenes after both 7 d and 15 d. The
presence of O. pini in phloem tissues significantly
affected the concentration of two monoterpenes after
7 d and only one monoterpene at 15 d (refer to
TABLE I for summary of ANOVA results). After 7 d
concentration of the monoterpene D-3-carene was on

average 42.9% lower in phloem that was colonized by
O. pini than phloem that was uncolonized and
concentration of the monoterpene terpinolene was
345.0% higher in phloem colonized by O. pini. After
15 d only concentrations of the monoterpene a-
pinene varied between colonized and uncolonized
phloem and a-pinene was 505.4% higher in colonized
phloem than uncolonized phloem.

pinene, D-3-carene, and limonene inhibited O. pini biomass growth relative to control, but amendments with myrcene and
terpinolene stimulated an increase in O. pini biomass. Bars represent one standard error.

DISCUSSION
Effect of monoterpenes on O. pini growth.—Our in vitro
experiments support the hypothesis that phytochem-
icals present in vascular tissues of ponderosa pine
mediate the growth of O. pini. Also these experiments
are the first to quantify biomass growth rate in any
bark-beetle associated yeast (FIG. 1). We demonstrate
here that over a fixed period the biomass of O. pini
varies depending on which monoterpenes are present
(FIG. 2). Although the majority of monoterpenes
examined here (e.g. a-pinene, b-pinene, D-3-carene
and limonene) inhibited the growth of O. pini,
exposure to myrcene and terpinolene stimulated an
increase in O. pini biomass growth compared to O.
pini that was incubated in pure growth media. These
experiments show that several ubiquitous monoter-
penes can significantly affect O. pini growth and that
these effects can vary.
Ponderosa pines exhibit substantial polymorphism
in monoterpene composition (Sturgeon 1979; Latta
et al. 2000, 2003). At least four chemically distinct and
geographically interspersed chemotypes exist in
northern Arizona, where all O. pini isolates used in
the present study were collected (Latta et al. 2000,
2003; Davis and Hofstetter unpubl data). Our
experiments suggest that the variation in monoter-
pene composition between individual pine trees
stands to substantially affect growth patterns of O.
pini. Given that O. pini and other yeasts are known to
affect the growth of filamentous fungal symbionts
associated with D. brevicomis (Adams et al. 2008, Davis
et al. 2010), the effect of host monoterpenes on O.
pini may have indirect consequences for interactions
among the fungal species assemblage vectored by the
beetle.
The effect of O. pini on phloem chemistry.—Our ex vivo
assays support the hypothesis that the presence of O.
pini affects the concentration of phytochemicals
present in the vascular tissues of ponderosa pine.
We noted a rapid decrease in monoterpene concen-
trations of phloem disks over time; however inocula-
tion with O. pini significantly affected the concentra-
tion of several monoterpenes at two periods. After 7 d
concentration of the monoterpene D-3-carene was
reduced by 42.9%, compared with phloem not
colonized by O. pini, and the concentration of
terpinolene was 345.0% higher on average in phloem
colonized by O. pini. This result was unexpected
because O. pini was found to produce D-3-carene in
headspace (Davis et al. 2010). After 15 d concentra-
tion of the monoterpene a-pinene was 505.4% higher
in phloem colonized by O. pini. No other monoter-
pene concentrations were affected by the presence of
O. pini. Future studies addressing carbon assimilation
by O. pini would be beneficial for linking a
physiological mechanism to these effects.
Our studies show that the presence of O. pini in the
phloem tissues of P. ponderosa affects concentrations
of monoterpenes that are known to have a range of
effects on nutritional filamentous fungi associated
with Dendroctonus bark beetles (Paine and Hanlon
1994, Hofstetter et al. 2005). The presence of O. pini
in phloem tissues might act to indirectly inhibit or
enhance growth of filamentous fungi as a result of
chemical changes to the phloem resource. The effect
of O. pini on phloem chemistry was temporally
variable so growth of nutritional filamentous fungi
in phloem may shift over time relative to the chemical
effect that O. pini has on phloem tissues. A change in
monoterpene concentrations in host trees also could
affect the colonization patterns of conspecific and

heterospecific beetles in a host tree (Hunt and
Borden 1990, Byers 1995, Paine and Raffa 1997).
In other ecological systems colonization of plant
tissues by insect-vectored yeast species has been shown
to reduce the toxicity of compounds that are
damaging to the insect vector. For example in the
cactophilic Drosophila-yeast associations colonization
of necrotic cactus tissues by yeasts was shown to
reduce concentrations of 2-propanol and acetone,
compounds that are otherwise toxic to Drosophila
(Starmer and Aberdeen 1990). Also the colonization
of necrotic cactus tissues by yeasts was found to
concentrate proteins and novel sterols that contribute
to the nutrition of fly larvae (Heed and Kircher 1965).
These studies support the notion that insect-vectored
yeasts might alter the chemical conditions of host
plants in a way that benefits both the insect and the
yeast. Symbiotic associations between insects and
yeasts have ecologically significant effects, especially
with tree-killing bark beetle species that are capable of
drastically altering ecosystem properties when beetle
populations reach high densities. Currently research
investigating patterns of reciprocal interaction be-
tween plant chemistry and insect-vectored yeast
species is scarce, aside from several seminal studies
(e.g. Heed and Kircher 1965, Hunt and Borden 1990,
Starmer and Aberdeen 1990), although insect-yeast
symbioses appear to represent ecologically significant
interactions.
The experiments reported here demonstrate two
important patterns: (i) the bark beetle-associated
yeast O. pini is likely responsive to variation in the
monoterpene composition of host plants (pines) and
(ii) the colonization of pine vascular tissues by O. pini
appears to influence the concentration of three
monoterpenes over time. The effects of shifting
monoterpene concentrations may influence the
suitability of pine vascular tissue as a habitat for the
growth of nutritional filamentous fungi that mycoph-
agous beetle larvae feed on. This pattern might have
important ecological consequences for bark beetle
populations. Further research regarding the effects of
O. pini in the D. brevicomis symbiont assemblage is
needed to complement our current understanding of
the factors that mediate these ecologically important
species complexes.
