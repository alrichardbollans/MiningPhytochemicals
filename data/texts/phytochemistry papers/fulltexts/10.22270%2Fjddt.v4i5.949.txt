INTRODUCTION 
Sapindus is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the 
Sapindaceae family 1, 2. The genus comprises three major 
species: The American spices, Sapindus saponaria and 
two Asian species, Sapindus mukorossi and Sapindus 
trifoliatus. The American species Sapindus saponaria is 
popularly known as western soapberry, cherrioni, 
jaboncillo, sabao-de-macaco, saboeiro, saboneteiro, fruta 
de sabao, sabao-de-soldado and grows on clay soils and 
on dry limestone uplands from southwestern Missouri to 
Louisiana, and westward through Oklahoma and Texas 
to southern Colorado, New Mexico, southern Arizona, 
northern Mexico and Brazilian Amazon region 3. Asian 
species, Sapindus mukorossi and Sapindus trifoliatus are 
known as soapnut, soapberry, washnut, reetha, aritha, 
dodan, doadni and flourishes well in deep clay loamy 
soil with an annual rainfall of 150-200 mm. Sapindus 
mukorossi is widely distributed in upper reaches of Indo-
Gangetic plains, Shivaliks and sub Himalayan tracts at 
altitudes from 200 m to 1500 m, while Sapindus 
trifoliatus is commonly found in the Western Ghats and 
plains of South India 4, 5. 
The members of genus Sapindus are well known for their 
folk medicinal values. The fruit of S. saponaria is used 
by loacal population for curing ulcers, external wounds 
and inflammation 6. S. mukorossi is well known for its 
detergent and insecticidal properties and it is traditionally 
used for removing lice from the scalp. The fruits are of 
considerable importance for their medicinal value for 
treating a number of diseases like excessive salivation, 
pimples, epilepsy, chlorosis, migranes, eczema and 
psoriasis. In Japan its pericarp is called “enmei-hi”, 
which means “life prolonging pericarp” and in China 
“wu-huan-zi”, the “non-illness fruit”.  The powdered 
seeds are employed in the treatment of dental caries, 
arthritis, common colds, constipation and nausea. The 
leaves are used in baths to relieve joint pain and the roots 
are used in the treatment of gout and rheumatism 7-11.

ABSTRACT 
Objective: Sapindus is a genus of Sapindaceae family comprises three major species: The American spices, Sapindus 
saponaria and two Asian species, Sapindus mukorossi and Sapindus trifoliatus and are well known for their folk medicinal 
values. Several important studies have been published in the intervening years, which have prompted us to reassess Sapindus. 
In the current review, we provide a comprehensive over view on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry and biological 
activities of the species of Sapindus.  
Methods: A literature survey was performed by searching the scientific data bases Pubmed, Google Scholar, SciFinder, Scopus 
and Web of Science, in addition to traditional Indian medicine and Ayurvedic texts for information on Sapindus.  
Results: Plants of the genus Sapindus have been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of ulcers, external wounds, 
inflammation, epilepsy, dental caries, arthritis, joint pain, gout and rheumatism. Phytochemical studies of this genus have 
identified more than 103 compounds. Of these compounds, triterpenoidal saponins of oleanane, dammarane and tirucullane are 
regarded as the active group that is most likely to be responsible for the observed biological activities. The crude extracts, as 
well as the isolated compounds, from the genus possess antimicrobial, anticancer, spermicidal, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-migraine, anti-diabetic, anti-ulcerogenic and analgesic 
properties.  
Conclusion: It is evident from the available literature that Sapindus species possess potential for use as a beneficial therapeutic 
remedy. Nevertheless, there is clearly a need for further studies focusing on in-vivo with emphasis on molecular mechanisms 
and eventually clinical trials.

Fruits of S. trifoliatus have been considered as a tonic, 
stomachic, alexipharmic, astringent and sedative to the 
uterus and also useful in chronic dysentery, diarrhea, 
cholera, hamicrania, paralysis and epileptic fits of 
children. The roots used as a collyrium in sore eyes and 
opthalmia. The seeds are employed to stimulate the 
uterus in childbirth and to increase mensuration 5, 7, 12-14.  
Recently, a number of studies have been conducted on 
the phytochemical and biological activities aspects of 
Sapindus. Phytochemical studies of Sapindus plants have 
identified more than 103 compounds, including 
flavonoids, triterpenoids, glycosides, carbohydrates, fatty 
acids, phenols, fixed oil, and saponins. Of these 
compounds, saponins are regarded as the active group 
that is most likely to be responsible for the observed 
biological effects 4, 7, 15-17. Moreover, both in-vivo and in-
vitro experiments have demonstrated that Sapindus 
exhibits a diverse set of antimicrobial, anticancer, 
spermicidal, hepatoprotective, anxiolytic, antioxidant, 
Anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-
fertility, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-migraine, anti-diabetic, 
anti-pruritis, anti-ulcerogenic and analgesic biological 
effects 4, 7, 12, 16-18. These studies will be evaluated in detail 
in this review. 
Several important studies have been published in the 
intervening years, which have prompted us to reassess 
Sapindus. In the current review, we provide a 
comprehensive over view on the ethnopharmacology, 
phytochemistry and biological activities of the species of 
Sapindus. 
BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIONS 
The genus Sapindus is classified in the division 
Magnoliophyta, class Magnoliopsida, subclass Rosidae, 
order Sapindales and family Sapindaceae 13, 16, 17.  
The three species of the genus are the American 
Sapindus saponaria and two Asian species, Sapindus 
mukorossi and Sapindus trifoliatus. Sapindus species are 
deciduous trees that thrive in tropical climates. Sapindus 
saponaria is a well known plant in American region, and 
has been used as traditional medicine by local population 
since ancient times. Sapindus saponaria is widely 
distributed with populations reported in southwestern 
Missouri to Louisiana, and westward through Oklahoma 
and Texas to southern Colorado, New Mexico, southern 
Arizona, northern Mexico and Brazilian Amazon region 
3, 6.   
Sapindus saponaria is a small to medium deciduous tree, 
7.7 to 15.4 m tall. The heavy, strong, close grained wood 
splits into thin strips. It contains long, pinnate leaves. 
This plant is described as polygamo-dioecious. That is, 
individual trees in a population may be truly dioecious 
(having only male or female flowers) or they may 
contain flowers with both male and female functions. 
The small, white flowers, borne in rather large clusters of 
terminal or axillary panicles, open during May to July. 
The fruit, a yellow, translucent, globular drupe 
measuring 10 to 14 mm in diameter, usually contains a 
single, dark brown, hard-coated seed, but occasionally 2 
or 3 seeds are present. The fruits ripen during September 
to October and persist on the tree until late winter or 
spring 19, 20. 
Sapindus mukorossi is a tree of tropical and sub-tropical 
region of Asia. It is a deciduous tree widely grown in 
upper reaches of Indo-Gangetic plains, Shivaliks and sub 
Himalayan tracts at altitudes from 200 m to 1500 m. The 
Sapindus mukorossi is a fairly large tree with a straight 
trunk up to 12 meters in height, sometimes attaining a 
height of 20 m and a girth of 1.8 m, with a globose 
crown and rather fine leathery foliage. Bark is dark to 
pale yellow, fairly smooth, with many vertical lines of 
lenticels and fine fissures exfoliating in irregular wood 
scales. The blaze is 0.8-1.3 cm, hard, not fibrous, pale 
orange brown, brittle and granular. Leaves are 30-50 cm 
long, alternate, paripinnate; common petiole very 
narrowly bordered, glabrous; leaflets 5-10 pairs, opposite 
or alternate, 5-18 by 2.5-5 cm, lanceolate, acuminate, 
entire, glabrous, often slightly falcate or oblique; petioles 
2-5 m long. Inflorescence is a compound terminal 
panicle, 30 cm or more in length, with pubescent 
branches. Flowers are about 5 mm across, small, 
terminal, polygamous, greenish white, subsessile, 
numerous, mostly bisexual. Sepals 5, each with a woolly 
scale on either side above the claw. Fruits are globose, 
fleshy, 1-seeded drupe, sometimes two drupels together, 
about 1.8-2.5 cm across. Seeds are 0.8-1.3 cm in 
diameter, globose, smooth, black and loosely placed in 
dry fruit 4, 16. 
The third species, Sapindus trifoliatus, occurs in the 
Western Ghats and plains of South India. This is a 
deciduous tree and flourishes well in deep clay loamy 
soil with an annual rain fall of 200 mm. It can reach a 
height of 25 m. Leaves are alternate, 15-40 cm long, 
pinnate, with 14 - 30 leaflets and the terminal leaflet 
often absent. The leaflets are elliptic-lance shaped, 
smooth with tipped points and slightly oblique based. 
They are often found in pairs of 2 or 3 and are 8 to 18 cm 
long and 5 to 7.5 cm wide. The flowers form in large 
panicles. The flowers are small greenish white in color 
and open during November to January. The fruit is a 
small leathery-skinned drupe 1-2 cm in diameter. The 
fruits are solitary globose appears in the month of July-
August. The fruit is velvety when young and turns hard 
and smooth on maturing. The fruits and seeds are slightly 
smaller than the north Indian species 5, 13, 21. 
TRADITIONAL USES 
Sapindus species have a long history as traditional 
remedies (Table 1) 5-14. All these species have been used 
in the areas where they are naturally distributed. 
Sapindus saponaria is mainly used in American region, 
while Sapindus mukorossi and Sapindus trifoliatus are 
mainly used in Asian countries as a traditional remedy. 
Interestingly, all these species have been used as 
detergent. 
Sapindus saponaria 
The fruit of S. saponaria, is used by local population for 
curing ulcers, external wounds and inflammations 6. 
Sapindus mukorossi 
Sapindus mukorossi is well known for its folk medicinal 
values. Pericarps of Sapindus mukorossi have been 
traditionally used as an expectorant as well as a source of 
natural surfactant 9. Due to the presence of saponins,

soapnut is well known for its detergent and insecticidal 
properties and it is traditionally used for removing lice 
from the scalp. The fruits are of considerable importance 
for their medicinal value for treating a number of 
diseases like excessive salivation, pimples, epilepsy, 
chlorosis, migranes, eczema and psoriasis. In Japan its 
pericarp is called “enmei-hi”, which means “life 
prolonging pericarp” and in China “wu-huan-zi”, the 
“non-illness fruit”.  The powdered seeds are employed in 
the treatment of dental caries, arthritis, common colds, 
constipation and nausea. The seeds of are used in 
Ayurvedic medicine to remove tan and freckles from the 
skin. It cleanses the skin of oily secretion and is even 
used as a cleanser for washing hair as it forms a rich, 
natural lather.  The leaves are used in baths to relieve 
joint pain and the roots are used in the treatment of gout 
and rheumatism 7-11. Since ancient times, Sapindus 
mukorossi has been used as a detergent for shawls and 
silks. The fruit was utilized by Indian jewelers for 
restoring the brightness of tarnished ornaments made of 
gold, silver and other precious metals 10. 
Sapindus trifoliatus 
The plant is very commonly used in Indian Ayurvedic 
healing system. It is also used in Unani and Tibetan 
indigenous medicine 13. In folklore practice, some of the 
tribes of Orissa (India) use the aerial parts of this plant 
for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Fruits of Sapindus 
trifoliatus have been considered as a tonic, stomachic, 
alexipharmic, astringent and sedative to the uterus and 
also useful in chronic dysentery, diarrhea, cholera, 
hamicrania, paralysis and epileptic fits of children. The 
roots used as a collyrium in sore eyes and opthalmia. The 
seeds are employed to stimulate the uterus in childbirth 
and to increase mensuration 5, 7, 12-14.

PHYTOCHEMISTRY  
Phytochemical studies of Sapindus plants have identified 
more than 103 compounds, including flavonoids, 
triterpenoids, glycosides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, 
phenols, fixed oil, and saponins. Of these compounds, 
saponins are regarded as the active group that is most 
likely to be responsible for the observed pharmacological 
effects. These saponins are found throughout the plant 
but are especially concentrated in the fruit 4, 7, 15-17. 
Saponins are secondary plant metabolites with divergent 
biological activities 23. Sapindus saponins are a mixture 
of six sapindosides (sapindosides A, B, C, D and 
mukorozi saponins (E1 and Y1), with sapindoside B as 
one of the major constituents, and identified by liquid 
chromatography and mass spectroscopy 24. Saponins are 
a large family of structurally-related compounds of 
steroid or triterpenoid aglycone (sapogenin) linked to one 
or more oligosaccharide moieties by glycosidic linkage. 
The aglycone, or sapogenin, may contain one or more 
unsaturated C-C bonds. The oligosaccharide chain is 
normally attached at the C3 position (monodesmosidic), 
but many saponins have an additional sugar moiety at the 
C2,6 or C2,8 position (bidesmosidic). The great complexity 
of the saponin structure arises from the variability of the 
aglycone structure, the nature of the side chains and the 
position of attachment of these moieties on the aglycone 
23
. The carbohydrate moiety consists of pentoses, 
hexoses or uronic acids. Due to this complexity, saponins 
are difficult to classify. Because it is no longer 
customary to classify compounds based on their 
physicochemical or biological properties, a state of the 
art classification based on the biosynthesis of the saponin 
carbon skeletons was proposed by Vincken et al 25. 
Different types of triterpene, saponins of oleanane, 
dammarane and tirucullane type were isolated from the 
galls, fruits and roots of Sapindus species. Oleanane type 
triterpenoid saponins named Sapindoside A & B (Fig. 34 
& 35) were reported from the fruits 26. Sapindoside C 
(Fig. 36) 27, Sapindoside D (Fig. 37) 28, which is a 
hexaoside of hederagenin, and Sapindoside E (Fig. 38) 29, 
a nonaoside of hederagenin, was isolated and identified 
from the methanolic extract of the fruits of Sapindus 
species.

Dammarane-type saponins, named Sapinmusaponins A 
& B (Fig. 11 & 12), C-E (Fig. 15, 16, 17), together with 
three known phenylpropanoid glycosides, were isolated 
from the galls of Sapindus mukorossi 30. Tirucallane-type 
saponins, sapinmusaponins F-J (Fig. 18-22), were 
isolated from the galls as reported by Huang et al 31. The 
structures of these saponins were elucidated on the basis 
of spectroscopic analysis including 1D and 2D NMR 
techniques. 
Triterpene saponins of oleanane type like, 
Sapinmusaponin K-N (Fig. 25-28), Mukorozisaponin G 
& E1 (Fig. 29-30), Sapindoside A & B along with 
dammarane types like Sapinmusaponin O and P (Fig. 13 
& 14) were isolated from fruits and the galls of Sapindus 
mukorossi as per Huang et al 32. In another study by 
Nakayama et al., Mukorozisaponin Y1 (Fig. 31), Y2 
(Fig. 32), X (Fig. 33) were isolated from the pericarp 33. 
Fractionation of an ethanolic extract of the galls of 
Sapindus mukorossi has resulted in the isolation of two 
tirucallane type triterpenoid saponins, sapinmusaponin Q 
and R (Fig. 23-24), along with three known oleanane 
type triterpenoid saponins: sapindoside A, sapindoside B, 
and hederagenin-3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)]-α-L-
rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)+-α-L arabinopyranoside 34. The 
roots of Sapindus mukorossi contain tirucallane-type 
triterpenoid saponins like Sapimukoside A & B 35 and 
Sapimukoside C & D 36. Further investigation of the 
roots of Sapindus mukorossi by Ni et al., reported the 
presence of Sapimukosides E-J 37. The structures of 
Sapimukosides A-J are shown in Fig. 1-10 respectively.

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES   
The traditional medicinal applications of Sapindus 
species have inspired many biological investigations. 
Several extracts of Sapindus species and isolated 
compounds have been evaluated for their anti-microbial, 
insecticidal, spermicidal, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, 
anxiolytic, tyrosinase inhibition and free radical 
scavenging property, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet 
aggregation, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-migraine, CNS 
activity, anti-diabetic, anti-ulcerogenic, analgesic, anti-
asthmatic, anti-trichomonas, molluscicidal and piscicidal 
activities 4, 7, 12, 16-18. 
Anti-microbial activity 
Several studies have demonstrated that Sapindus species 
possess anti-microbial effects in-vivo and in-vitro. Leaf 
extracts of Sapindus species were reported anti-microbial 
activity against bacteria. Both methanolic and aqueous 
extract showed varying degree of inhibitory potential 
against Escherichia coli and Psuedomonas aeruginosa. 
Methanolic extract of leaves also showed the antifungal 
activity against the tested fungus Aspergillus niger. 
Sapindua showed strong antibacterial activity against M. 
flavus, S. epidermidis and P. morganii 15. Another 
investigation was also reported on the leaf extract against 
six bacterial strains, Pseudomonas testosteroni, 
Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella pneumonia, 
Bacillus subtilis and Proteus morganii and showed most 
potent antibacterial activity 38. The crude extract of 
Sapindus mukorossi exhibits a strong growth inhibition 
against the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, which 
causes cutaneous candidiasis. Extracts from the dried 
pericarp of Sapindus fruits were investigated for their 
antifungal activity against clinical isolates of yeasts 
Candida albicans and Candida non-albicans from 
vaginal secretions of women with Vulvovaginal 
Candidiasis. Four clinical isolates of C. albicans, a single 
clinical isolate of each of the species C. parapsilosis, C. 
glabrata, C. tropicalis, and the strain of C. albicans 
ATCC 90028 were used. The hydroalcoholic extract was 
bioactivity-directed against a clinical isolate of C. 
parapsilosis, and showed strong activity. The n-BuOH 
extract and one fraction showed strong activity against

all isolates tested 39. The saponin fraction inhibited the 
dermatophytic fungi Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton 
mentagrophytes, Sabouraudites canis and 
Epidermophyton floccosum 11. Ibrahim et al. evaluated 
that ethanolic and chloroform extracts of Sapindus 
mukorossi inhibited the growth of Helicobacter pylori 
(both sensitive and resistant), at very low concentrations, 
when given orally for seven days to male wister rats. In 
the in-vitro study, the isolates show a considerable zone 
of inhibition at very low concentration (10μg/mL) and in 
the in-vivo study the Helicobacter pylori infection was 
cleared with minimal dose extracts of 2.5 mg/mL 40. 
Lemos and co-workers reported the anti-microbial 
activity of saponin from the ethyl-acetate fraction of 
fruits of S. saponaria 18.

Insecticidal activity 
Saponins possess insecticidal activity, causing mortality 
and/or growth inhibition in the insects tested the cotton 
leafworm Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars and the pea 
aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. In the experiments with 
Acyrthosiphon pisum, 0.1% saponin killed all aphids, 
whereas with Spodoptera some caterpillars were still able 
to develop into apparently normal adults on food 
containing 7% saponins 41. Saponins can be employed as 
novel natural tactics in integrated pest management 
(IPM) to control pest insects, which fit in modern 
agriculture and horticulture 42. Ethanolic extract of 
Sapindus mukorossi was investigated for repellency and 
insecticidal activity against Sitophilus oryzae and 
Pediculus humanus. Average mortality percentage 
indicated that the extracts caused significant mortality 
and repellency on the target insects and bioassays 
indicated that toxic and repellent effect was proportional 
to the concentration 43. 
Spermicidal activity 
Saponins from Sapindus mukorossi are known to be 
spermicidal 44. Morphological changes in human 
ejaculated spermatozoa after exposure to this saponin 
were evaluated under scanning electron microscopy. The 
minimum effective concentration (0.05% in spot test) did 
not affect the surface topography after exposure for one 
minute. However, incubation of spermatozoa for 10 
minutes resulted in extensive vesiculation and a 
disruption of the plasma membrane in the head region. 
Higher concentrations (0.1%, 1.25%, 2.5% and 5.0%) 
caused more or less similar changes which included 
vesiculation, vacuolation, disruption or erosion of 
membranes in the head region. These findings suggest 
that the morphological changes observed are due to

alterations in the glycoproteins associated with the lipid 
bilayer of the plasma membrane of spermatozoa 8. This 
spermicidal property has been used in contraceptive 
cream 45. A contraceptive cream developed by the CDRI 
(Lucknow) is going to hit the Indian markets. It is 
advocated to be totally safe and easy to use. It is intended 
for post-coital use 46. Raghuvanshi et al. developed a 
spermicide compound, called Praneem polyherbal, 
featuring anti-microbial traits, from the pericarp of fruit 
of S. mukorossi, leaves of Azadirachta indica, and oil of 
Mentha citrata. The association of these three plants 
produced a highly powerful spermicide, which was 
tested on rabbits and on human sperm through in-vitro 
and in-vivo studies. When this spermicide was applied to 
the vagina of female rabbits, pregnancy failed to occur  18. 
Anti-cancer activity 
Due to the great variability in saponin structure, saponins 
always display anti-tumorigenic effect through varieties 
of anti-tumor pathways 47. Kuo and co-workers tested the 
cytotoxic effect of saponins isolated from the galls of S. 
mukorossi. The preliminary bioassay data revealed that 
saponins showed moderate cytotoxic activity (ED50 ~ 9–
18 μg/mL) against human tumor cell lines 
(Hepa59T/VGH, NCL, HeLa and Med) 48. 
Strychnopentamine was the reference compound used in 
the study. All saponins were reported to be at least five 
times less active than the reference compound 49. Pradhan 
and co-workers reported that fruit extract of S. trifoliatus 
inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines 
SKBR3 and MDA-MB435 13. 
Hepatoprotective activity 
Ibrahim and co-workers reported that the extracts of fruit 
pericarp of Sapindus mukorossi (2.5 mg/L) and rhizomes 
of Rheum emodi (3.0 mg/L) have a protective capacity 
both in-vitro on primary hepatocytes cultures and in-vivo 
in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) mediated 
liver injury as judged from serum marker enzyme 
activities 50. Thus, it was concluded that the extracts of 
Sapindus mukorossi and Rheum emodi do have a 
protective capacity both in-vitro on primary hepatocytes 
cultures and in in-vivo in a rat model of CCl4 mediated 
liver injury. 
Anxiolytic activity 
Methanolic extracts of S. mukorossi (200 and 40 mg/L) 
show significant anxiolytic activity as compared to 
standard anxiolytics Diazepam (2 mg/Kg) and Fluoxetine 
(10 mg/Kg) 51. 
Tyrosinase inhibition and free radical scavenging 
activity 
Chen et al. first evaluated that the extracts of S. 
mukorossi seeds using methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate 
(EA) or hexane as solvents show tyrosinase inhibition 
and free radical scavenging properties. S. mukorossi 
extracts showed strong specific inhibition activities on 
the proliferation of human melanoma and lung cell lines. 
The data exhibited the high potential of applying S. 
mukorossi extracts in medical cosmetology, food 
supplementation, antibiotics and chemotherapy 52. 
Anti-inflammatory activity 
Takagi and co-workers investigated the anti-
inflammatory activities of hederagenin and crude 
saponin isolated from S. mukorossi, using carrageenin-
induced edema, granuloma pouch and adjuvant arthritis 
in rats. The effects of these agents on vascular 
permeability and acetic-acid-induced writhing in mice 
were also examined. Anti-inflammatory activity on 
carrageenin edema was observed after intraperitoneal 
and oral administration of crude saponin, whereas 
hederagenin and the other agents showed activity only 
when administered intraperitoneally. They observed that 
crude saponin showed a significant inhibitory effect on 
granuloma and exudate formations in rats, inhibited the 
increase in vascular permeability and the number of 
writhings induced by acetic acid in mice, and 
significantly inhibited the development of hind-paw 
edema associated with adjuvant arthritis in rats after oral 
administration. They concluded that crude saponin shows 
some degree of anti-inflammatory activity 53. Arul and 
co-workers reported the anti-inflammatory action of an 
ethanol extract of S. trifoliatus seeds by paw-edema 
induction and pleurisy methods caused by carrageenin 
and granuloma formation. The extract produced 
decreases in paw edema and in pleural sweating volume, 
and had an inhibitory effect on leucocyte migration. A 
decrease in granuloma weight was also reported 54. 
Arulmozhi and co-workers investigated the effect of the 
aqueous lyophilized extract of the pericarp of S. 
trifoliatus fruits through in-vivo and in-vitro 
experimental models of inflammation. The in-vitro 
evaluation showed the extract inhibitory activity against 
the inflammatory agents 5-lipoxygenase, 
cyclooxygenase, leukotriene B4 and nitricoxide synthase. 
The extract significantly inhibited inflammation of paw 
edema caused by carrageenin, histamine, serotonin and 
zymosan in rats and mice. Moreover, topical application 
significantly inhibited ear edema caused by 
inflammatory agents such as 13-acetate-O-tetradecanoil-
phorbol (TPA), capsaicin or arachidonic acid. They 
concluded that the extract has an anti-inflammatory 
activity, probably mediated by the 5-lipoxygenase and 
cyclo-oxygenase pathways 55. 
Anti-platelet aggregation activity 
Biological evaluation of ethanolic extract of the galls of 
S. mukorossi showed that two saponins isolated 
sapinmusaponins Q and R demonstrated more potent 
anti-platelet aggregation activity than aspirin  34. 
Sapinmusaponins F-J isolated from the galls of S. 
mukorossi showed anti-platelet-aggregation effects, but 
no obvious cytotoxic activity for platelets as assayed by 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was reported 31. 
Anti-hyperlipidemic activity 
The saponins from Sapindus species fruit extract found 
to have significant anti-hyperlipidemic activity. 
Methanolic extract at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg 
significantly lowered both plasma glycerides and 
cholesterol levels. The cholesterol lowering activity of 
the fruit extract result from the breakdown of LDL 
cholesterol by enhancing enzymatic action 56. 
Anti-migraine activity 
Goyal et al                                       Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics; 2014, 4(5), 7-20 18 
© 2011-14, JDDT. All Rights Reserved                                       ISSN: 2250-1177                                   CODEN (USA): JDDTAO 
Arulmozhi and co-workers studied the effect of the 
aqueous pericarp extract of fruits of S. trifoliatus in an 
in-vivo migraine hyperalgesic model. The results showed 
that antagonism to dopamine D2 might underlie the 
mechanism involved in the anti-hyperalgesic activity of 
the plant extract 57. 
CNS activity 
Methanolic extract of fruit of Sapindus species found to 
produce CNS depressant activity. The methanolic extract 
of Pericarps at 100 and 200 mg/kg caused a significant 
reduction in the spontaneous activity, exploratory 
behavioral pattern, muscle relaxant activity, inhibition of 
cocaine induced hyperactivity and also extensively 
potentiated phenobarbitone sodium–induced sleeping 
time. This extract produced a considerable increase in the 
hypnotic effect induced by the phenobarbitone in a dose 
dependent manner, suggesting a profile sedative activity 
58. Various scientific research reports showed that 
presence of triterpenoids in the methanolic extract may 
be responsible for the CNS depressant activity 59. 
Anti-diabetic activity 
Jeyabalan and co-workers studied the anti-hyperglycemic 
effect of alcoholic extract of leaves of Sapindus species 
in the glucose overloaded hyperglycemic rats. The 
extract at different doses exhibited a significant 
hypoglycemic activity in dose dependent manner. The 
study also revealed that level of total hemoglobin, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, serum creatinine, serum urea 
and lipid profiles measured showed the anti-diabetic 
activity 60. 
Anti-ulcerogenic activity 
Albiero and co-workers investigated the inhibitory effect 
of a hydro-alcoholic extract of leaves and fruits of S. 
saponaria on stress-induced gastric lesions. Their results 
showed that both extracts caused a decrease in gastric 
secretion. However, the saponin- and tannin-rich fruit 
extract was more effective in anti-ulcerogenic activity 61. 
In another study, Kishore and co-workers reported that 
methanolic and aqueous extracts of leaves of S. 
trifoliatus showed significant reduction in the pylorus 
ligation induced ulcers in rats 12. 
Analgesic activity 
Sahoo and co-workers investigated the ethanolic extract 
of Sapindus trifoliatus in in-vivo model of diabetic 
neuropathic pain. They concluded that extract showed 
significant effectiveness in diabetic neuropathic pain and 
protection produced by stimulation of adenosine A1-
receptors 62. 
Anti-trichomonas activity 
Tiwari and co-workers demonstrated that the Sapindus 
saponin mixture shows anti-Trichomonas activity at a 
10-fold lower concentration (0.005%) than its minimal 
effective spermicidal concentration against human 
spermatozoa (0.05%) 63. Saponin concentration 
dependently inhibited the ability of parasites to adhere to 
HeLa cells and decreased the proteolytic activity of the 
parasite’s cysteine proteinases. This was associated with 
the decreased expression of adhesin AP65 and 
membrane-expressed cysteine proteinase TvCP2 genes. 
Saponins produced no adverse effect on host cells in 
mitochondrial reduction potential measurement assay. 
Saponins also reversed the inhibitory mechanisms 
exerted by Trichomonas for evading host immunity. 
Early response of saponins to disrupt actin cytoskeleton 
in comparison with their effect on the nucleus suggests a 
membrane-mediated mode of action rather than via 
induction of apoptosis 44, 63. 
Molluscicidal activity 
Extracts of Sapindus mukorossi showed molluscicidal 
effect against the golden apple snail and Pomacea 
canaliculata Lamarck. (Ampullariidae) with LC50 values 
of 85, 22 and 17 ppm at 24, 48 and 72 h exposure period, 
respectively 64. Upadhyay and Singh, reported that S. 
mukorossi fruit pericarp is a potential source of botanical 
molluscicides against Lymnaea acuminate 65. These 
snails are the intermediate host of liver fluke Fasciola 
gigantica, which causes 94% fascioliasis in the buffalo 
population of northern India 66. Ribeiro and co-workers 
reported molluscicidal activity of alcoholic extract of 
Sapindus saponaria 18. 
Piscicidal activity 
Effects of Sapindus mukorossi have been studied on fish. 
Pericarp of S. mukorossi is the most toxic parts yielding 
100% mortality rate within 12 hours and mean survival 
time was found to be 1.18 hours. LD10, LD50, LD100 
ranging between 3.5 ppm and 10 ppm at 48 hrs and 
possess high potential for fish eradication. S. mukorossi 
fruit pericarp can be used as a selective eradicant for 
horny fish like Heteropneustes fossils and Channa 
punctuate 67. 
Anti-asthmatic activity 
Parganiha and co-workers evaluated the in-vitro anti-
asthmatic activity of Sapindus mukorossi on 
acetylcholine induced contraction of goat tracheal chain 
preparation. They reported that the aqueous extract of S. 
mukorossi fruits at the doses of 380 mcg/ml and 640 
mcg/ml significantly inhibited acetylcholine induced 
bronchoconstriction of isolated goat trachea and 
concluded that the aqueous extract of fruit of S. 
mukorossi has significant anti-asthmatic potential 68. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this review, we documented the existing traditional 
uses of the species of the genus Sapindus and 
summarized recent research in to the phytochemistry and 
biological properties of the genus. Previous studies have 
documented that Sapindus species have traditionally 
been used to treat ulcers, external wounds, inflammation, 
excessive salivation, pimples, epilepsy, chlorosis, 
migraines, eczema, psoriasis, dental caries, arthritis, 
common colds, constipation, nausea, joint pain, gout and 
rheumatism. Some of these traditional uses have been 
validated by phytochemical and modern pharmacological 
studies. The extracts and single compounds derived from 
the genus have been found to possess various biological 
activities, especially in the areas of anti-microbial, 
insecticidal, spermicidal, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, 
anxiolytic, tyrosinase inhibition and free radical 
scavenging property, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet 
aggregation, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-migraine, CNS

activity, anti-diabetic, anti-ulcerogenic, analgesic, anti-
asthmatic, anti-trichomonas, molluscicidal and piscicidal 
activities. Triterpenoidal saponins of oleanane, 
dammarane and tirucullane types are regarded as the 
active group that is most likely to be responsible for the 
observed biological properties. 
Although increased interest has prompted more studies 
on the phytochemistry and biological activities of the 
genus Sapindus, there are still many areas where our 
current knowledge could be improved. (i) Several 
traditional uses of the genus have been validated in 
recent biological studies; however, some of these 
biological activities were only tested in-vitro. Thus, the 
effectiveness of these compounds in-vivo needs to be 
further investigated. (ii) The genus Sapindus is a rich 
source of triterpenoidal saponins of oleanane, 
dammarane and tirucullane, many with the same skeletal 
structure. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate 
the structure-activity relationships of these saponins. We 
would expect to find high efficiency compounds from 
these saponins. (iii) It is evident from the available 
literature that Sapindus species possess potential for use 
as a beneficial therapeutic remedy. However, the analysis 
of previous biological research suggests that a clear 
assignment of active molecules and mechanisms of 
action is remain lacking. Taken together, the importance 
of genus Sapindus has been highlighted based on their 
wide usage in traditional medicine as well as potential in 
beneficial therapeutic remedy. Nevertheless, there is 
clearly a need for further studies focusing on in-vivo 
with emphasis on molecular mechanisms and eventually 
clinical trials.
