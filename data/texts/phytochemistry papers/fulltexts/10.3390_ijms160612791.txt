Abstract: Moringa oleifera is an interesting plant for its use in bioactive compounds.  
In this manuscript, we review studies concerning the cultivation and production of moringa 
along with genetic diversity among different accessions and populations. Different 
methods of propagation, establishment and cultivation are discussed. Moringa oleifera 
shows diversity in many characters and extensive morphological variability, which may 
provide a resource for its improvement. Great genetic variability is present in the natural 
and cultivated accessions, but no collection of cultivated and wild accessions currently 
exists. A germplasm bank encompassing the genetic variability present in Moringa is 
needed to perform breeding programmes and develop elite varieties adapted to local 
conditions. Alimentary and medicinal uses of moringa are reviewed, alongside the 
production of biodiesel. Finally, being that the leaves are the most used part of the plant, 
their contents in terms of bioactive compounds and their pharmacological properties are 
discussed. Many studies conducted on cell lines and animals seem concordant in their 
support for these properties. However, there are still too few studies on humans to

recommend Moringa leaves as medication in the prevention or treatment of diseases. 
Therefore, further studies on humans are recommended.

1. Origin and Geographical Distribution 
In the monogeneric genus Moringa of Moringaceae family there are 13 species (namely, M. arborea, 
indigenous to Kenya; M. rivae indigenous to Kenya and Ethiopia; M. borziana, indigenous to Somalia 
and Kenia; M. pygmaea indigenous to Somalia; M. longituba indigenous to Kenia, Ethiopia and 
Somalia; M. stenopetala indigenous to Kenya and Ethiopia; M ruspoliana indigenous to Ethiopia;  
M. ovalifolia indigenous to Namibia and Angola; M. drouhardii, M. hildebrandi indigenous to 
Madagascar; M. peregrine indigenous o Red sea and Horn of Africa, M. concanensis, Moringa oleifera 
indigenous to sub-Himalayan tracts of Northern India [1]), among which Moringa oleifera (Figure 1) 
has so far become the most used and studied. 
This species is a fast growing soft wood tree that can reach 12 m in height and is indigenous to the 
Himalayan foothills (northern India Pakistan and Nepal) [2,3]. Its multiple uses and potential attracted 
the attention of farmers and researchers in past historical eras. Ayurvedic traditional medicine says that 
Moringa oleifera can prevent 300 diseases and its leaves have been exploited both for preventive and 
curative purposes [4]. Moreover, a study in the Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu India reports 
Moringa among the species utilized by traditional Siddha healers [5]. Ancient Egyptians used  
Moringa oleifera oil for its cosmetic value and skin preparation [6]; even if the species never became 
popular among Greeks and Romans, they were aware of its medical properties [7]. Moringa oleifera has 
been grown and consumed in its original areas until recently (the 1990s) when a few researchers started to 
study its potential use in clarifying water treatments, while only later were its nutritional and medical 
properties “discovered” and the species was spread throughout almost all tropical countries. In 2001, the 
first international conference on Moringa oleifera was held in Tanzania and since then the number of 
congresses and studies increased disseminating the information about the incredible properties of  
Moringa oleifera. Now this species has been dubbed “miracle tree”, or “natural gift”, or “mother’s  
best friend”. 
Moringa oleifera grows in any tropical and subtropical country with peculiar environmental features, 
namely, dry to moist tropical or subtropical clime, with annual precipitation of 760 to 2500 mm  
(it requires less than 800 mm irrigation) and temperature between 18 and 28 °C. It grows in any soil 
type, but heavy clay and waterlogged, with pH between 4.5 and 8, at an altitude up to 2000 m [8,9]. 
A study on local uses and geographical distribution of Moringa oleifera [10] that covers the major 
agro-ecological region in Nigeria, clearly established that “though considered a not indigenous species, 
Moringa oleifera has found wide acceptance among various ethnic Nigeria, who have exploited 
different uses (e.g., food, medicine, fodder etc.). 
Nowadays, Moringa oleifera and its derivatives are distributed mainly in Middle East, African and 
Asian countries [11] and are still spreading to other areas.

2. Cultivation and Production 
Moringa oleifera development is achieved in two main ways: sowing and cutting. 
Traditionally in Sudan the seeds are preferred while vegetative propagation is common in India, 
Indonesia and in some areas of West Africa [8]. 
Sowing requires selection of the seeds, when they are easily available and human labor is limited, 
while the possibility to transplant seedlings allows flexibility in field planting even if it requires extra 
labor and costs. 
Seeds germinate within two weeks, at a maximum 2 cm depth. When sowing is planned in nursery, 
the seedlings can be transplanted when they reach about 30 cm (3–6 weeks after germination) [12]. 
The number of seeds per kilogram ranges from 3000 to 9000, depending on the variety, with  
a germination rate of 80%–90% for ideal storage conditions (3 °C, 5%–8% moisture). However,  
the viability decreases if seeds remain at ambient temperature and high relative humidity, their 
germination rate dropping to 7.5% after three months [3,13]. 
Cutting is preferred when seeds availability is scarce and/or when labor is not a limiting factor. 
Ramachandran et al. [14] reports that plants raised from seeds produce fruits of poorer quality, while 
Animashaun et al. [15] suggest that trees grown from seeds develop longer roots (an advantage for 
stabilization and access to water) compare to that grown from cuttings that have much shorter roots. 
When hard woodcuttings (1–2 m long 4–16 cm diameter [8,15]) from adult trees are planted during 
the rainy season burying one third in the soil, they readily develop roots that in few months reach a 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12794 
 
 
considerable size [16]. Moringa oleifera is an exceptionally fast growing tree, in three months it can be  
3 m high and in few years reaches 12 m if it is left to growth naturally. Since the tree vigorously  
re-sprouts after cutting, pruning or pollarding are usually practiced to enhance lateral branching and 
give the tree a bush shape in order to facilitate the harvest. Nevertheless, since literature reports about 
the good practice management of Moringa oleifera are scant, practical trials are needed [12].  
Leaves and seeds are the parts of the plant of interest. Accordingly, the spatial distribution in planting 
Moringa oleifera trees is designed to facilitate the relevant harvest and the management practices. 
For production of leaves, Moringa oleifera plantation can be designed as follows: 
(i) intensive production with spacing ranging from 10 cm × 10 cm to 20 cm × 20 cm, harvest 
interval between 35 to 45 days, irrigation and fertilization are needed; 
(ii) semintensive production with spacing about 50 cm × 100 cm, harvest interval between 50 to  
60 days, irrigation and fertilization suggested; 
(iii) integrate in an agroforestry system with spacing distance of 2–4 m between rows, harvest 
interval around 60 days, fertilization and irrigation not strictly necessary. 
Production decreases from intensive production to less dense spacing (agroforestry system), 
although a tremendous variability can be observed for a given spatial distribution and the same 
cultivation management. For example, the yield of an intensive plantation can range from 580 to  
40 m/ha/year [15], being season dependent with the largest yield in wet or cold season. There is a need 
for further studies to assess optimum spacing and harvest intervals that comply with the different 
climates and production systems [17–19]. Harvest can be mechanical or manual. Shoots are cut at a  
0.5–1 m height above the ground; but leaves can be picked directly off the tree; this practice, however, 
albeit quicker, leads to a less vigorous re-growth. 
For the production of seed a low density plantation has a positive effect on yields: typically  
2.5 × 2.5 m or 3 × 3 m triangular pattern [20]. Fruits (trilobite capsule), referred as pods (brown color 
and dry and split longitudinally), ripen about three months after flowering and must be harvested as 
soon as possible. Each pod usually contains about 26 1-cm diameter seeds lined by three whitish 
papery leaflets on the edge. Like for leaves, also the production of seed shows a tremendous 
variability. A single tree can produce from 15.000 to 25.000 seeds with an average weight of 0.3 gr per 
seed [21]; moreover early flowering varieties produce pods in six month, while other varieties require 
more than one year. After pruning, branches develop new pods within 6 months [1]. 
3. Genetic and Breeding 
The major Moringa oleifera producer is India with an annual production of 1.1 to 1.3 million tons 
of tender fruits from an area of 380 km2 [22]. Information about the production in other countries is 
scarce. The great interest in Moringa oleifera does not concern its commercial value, being mainly 
related to its multipurpose uses and its ability to guarantee a reliable yield, while other crops cannot, in 
countries where people are mostly at risk of suffering from nutritional deficiencies. Indeed its 
cultivation is localized in developing countries where different parts of the plant are utilized: seeds for 
oil and water purification; leaves, seeds and fruits for their high nutritional value (nutritional 
integrator); leaves and seeds for biomass and animal feeding; different parts in traditional medicine. 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12795 
 
 
Moreover, Moringa has been planted around the world and is naturalized in many areas (i.e., almost 
the entire tropical belt) increasing the variability of the species. 
As Moringa is a cross-pollinated tree, high heterogeneity in form and yield is expected.  
Several works indeed report variability in flowering time [23] (from annual type to perennial type), 
tree nature (from deciduous to evergreen), tree shape (from semi spread to upright), resistance to hairy 
caterpillar [22–24], flowering time (i.e., some tree flowering throughout the year while others flower in 
two distinct season) [14]. 
Although Moringa oleifera shows diversification in many characters and high morphological 
variability, which may become a resource for its improvement, the major factors that limit productivity 
are the absence of elite varieties adapted to local conditions and the use of seeds obtained through open 
pollination from plants in the planted area. Furthermore, despite the various uses of Moringa oleifera 
and its morphological differentiation, the number of accessions to collections and active germplasm 
banks are incipient across the world. 
Many ecotypes are present in India: Jaffna (soft and taste fruits), Chavakacheri murungai (similar to 
Jaffna), Chemmurungai (red tipped fruits), Kadumurungai (small and inferior fruits) Palmurungai 
(bitter taste), Punamurungai (similar to Palmurungai), Kodikalmurungai (short fruit), Palmurungai, 
Puna Murungai and Kodikkal Murungai and wild Kadumurunga [14,25]. Recently two varieties 
(PKM-1; PKM2) have been developed at Horti Nursery Networks, Tamil Nadu, India, to improve pod 
production: usually those varieties are grown as annual; after two harvests the tree is dragged out and 
new seedlings are planted [26]. At Kerala Agricultural University (India) several varieties have been 
developed and available. 
Outside India there are research centers focused on Moringa oleifera improvement across the 
world: AVDRC (Taiwan), Rural development initiative (Zambia), Moringa Philippines foundation 
(Philippines) Moringa community (Zambia). 
In spite of the great variability of Moringa oleifera no institutions have a germplasm bank or data 
base with either cultivated or spontaneous accessions. The divergence between genetic variability 
inherent to the species and poor variability reflected in germplasm banks should be fixed since it 
represents an obstacle for the progress of breeding programs. 
Moringa cytological studies revealed that Moringa oleifera has 2c genome size of 1.2 pg [27] and it 
is a true diploid with 2n = 28 [14]. Since 1999 molecular markers have become standards for the 
genetic characterization of Moringa oleifera. Studies started with the use of dominant markers until the 
development of co-dominant markers (in 2010) that allow distinction between homozygotes and 
heterozygotes, which provides optimal genetic information profiles. 
Interestingly, out of 2857 scientific publications on Moringa oleifera in the primary database  
(Web of Science), only 12 include genetic characterization based on molecular markers. Furthermore, 
only 77 fragments of DNA and RNA sequences are available (data from NCBI nucleotide database). 
This means that the genetic approach and its potential application in breeding programs are just at the 
beginning step. The common aim of almost all the studies is the genetic diversification among 
different populations and/or accessions: dominant markers are the most used (66% of all papers). 
In spite of the limited range of dominant markers (heterozygote cannot be distinguished from 
homozygote specimens), the studies among commercial, cultivated or natural accessions have 
contributed to the understanding of genetic variability of Moringa oleifera. In this context, Amplified

Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses 
along with Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and cytochrome P450 were used. Muluvi et al. [28] 
used AFLP to investigate seven natural populations from India and introduced populations in Malawi 
and Kenya. Authors found a significant level of population differentiation and separation of genotypes 
based on geographical origin. Moreover, high portion of genetic variability was within Indian 
accessions. In line with these findings, the authors argued that Kenya populations presumably came 
from India, as suggested by the small number of genetically related accessions. Thank to the same 
molecular markers [29] the outcrossing rate in Moringa oleifera was detected: 26% of selfing in 
Moringa trees. This evidence had a strong impact on the breeding program, as inbreed lines and 
hybridization allowed improvement of the species. 
RAPD were used by different authors to investigate cultivated and non-cultivated population of 
Tanzania [30], different accessions in Nigeria [31], accessions present in Embra Cosatal Teblelands 
Sergipe germplasm bank in Brazil [32], commercially grown varieties in India [33], new genotype 
developed in different countries (Thailand, USA, India and Malaysia, Tanzania, Taiwan) [34], and 
further accessions in Nigeria [35]. All these studies showed the higher level of genetic diversity in 
natural population with respect to the cultivated ones. Cultivated accessions present in the considered 
germplasm banks are genetically close and need to be widen to promote increased diversity and used in 
breeding programs. Many studies disagree with Muluvi’s conclusions that a significant level of population 
differentiation and separation of genotypes can be based on the geographical origin. Indeed no clusters 
were found according to geographical origins. This could be due to the planting spread that produced  
a high rate of gene flow through cross-pollination. Interestingly, Popoola et al. [35] investigated  
morpho-metric characters along with molecular markers and showed a good correlation between 100 
seeds weight with pod length, pod weight, number of seeds per lobule and number of seed per pod. 
Studies on Moringa oleifera with co-dominat markers started in 2010 when Wu et al. [36] 
developed microsatellite markers. The first successful estimates of genetic diversity and population 
structure were obtained with Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) in 2013 by Shahazad et al. [37].  
These authors evaluated accessions collected in different locations of Pakistan and accessions from 
different countries (India, Tanzania, Senegal, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Florida, Mexico, Haiti, Belize) 
obtained from Educational Concerns foe Hunger Organization (ECHO). They found high genetic 
diversity in wild Pakistan accessions, whereas low genetic diversity in ECHO accessions.  
Moreover, ECHO accessions are more similar to those of a single province of Pakistan. Most likely, 
British colonialists introduced Moringa oleifera in early of twentieth century in Africa from India, 
while in the 1784 an Englishman took Moringa oleifera over to Jamaica [37]. The export pathway was 
restricted to Indian coastal region (where most movement of goods and people took place) and 
involved a relatively small number of accessions that belonged to a common or few populations.  
This explains the low genetic variability within ECHO accessions with respect to the Pakistan ones. 
Later on, a further investigation on twelve Indian populations, from northern and southern regions 
of India, was performed through SSR together with morphological markers [38]. In this study too, 
individuals from various geographical areas were not significantly different genetically, while a large 
variability exist in Indian populations. Morphological analysis on fourteen quantitative and eleven 
qualitative characters showed correlation among some quantitative characters, e.g., between tree 
tallness with fruit girth, trunk girth with tree branching. More SSR were identified in 2014 thanks to 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12797 
 
 
EST examination involving several plant species [39] and not utilized so far in Moringa oleifera 
genetic investigation. 
Even if all the reported studies are valuables and have a tremendous importance for conservation, 
selection and collection of Moringa oleifera seeds, same questions are still to be addresses in order to 
develop an improved Moringa oleifera cultivation. Considering the cultivation challenges, some 
research activities should be prioritized: (i) collection and characterization of world accessions both 
cultivated and natural in order to obtain a true understanding of the genetic diversity and structure of 
Moringa oleifera; (ii) set a collaborative network among National and International Research Centre, 
O.N.G, farmers that already work on Moringa oleifera. 
This will help scientists and producers to: 
• have a reliable access to information about genetics and materials to develop better Moringa 
varieties and technologies for farming practices: phenotypic characterization is a priority to 
evaluated the accessions; 
• ensure that Moringa production is improved along with best cultivation practice; 
• focus research on the association between phenotypic and molecular data within the contest  
of breeding; 
• define maps (both association map and physical map) to identify genes that may confer 
resistance to biotic and abiotic stress and quantitative traits loci (QTL) for a possible 
introgression of genes into commercial and cultivated accessions. 
Today next generation sequencing (NGS) [40] is an approachable tool to discovery genome-wide 
genetic markers. This technique could be applied to species with no existing genome data like 
Moringa. Thank to NGS a saturated genetic map could be obtain within reasonable cost and time, in 
turn interesting characters could be identified and exploited in breeding programmes. 
4. Traditional Uses 
All plant parts of Moringa oleifera are traditionally used for different purposes, but leaves are 
generally the most used [10,41]. In particular, they are used in human and animal nutrition and in  
the traditional medicine. Leaves are rich in protein, mineral, beta-carotene and antioxidant  
compounds, which are often lacking among the populations of underdeveloped or developing 
countries. Moringa leaves are added to food preparations as integrators of the diet. In traditional 
medicine, these leaves are used to treat several ailments including malaria, typhoid fever, parasitic 
diseases, arthritis, swellings, cuts, diseases of the skin, genito-urinary ailments, hypertension and 
diabetes. They are also used to elicit lactation and boost the immune system (to treat HIV/AIDS related 
symptoms) [10,41–45], as well as cardiac stimulants and contraceptive remedy. One can directly 
consume either raw and dried leaves or the extract of an aqueous infusion. 
Similarly, the use of seeds concerns both human nutrition and traditional medicine. Barks are boiled 
in water and soaked in alcohol to obtained drinks and infusions that can be used to treat stomach 
ailments (ease stomach pain, ulcer and aiding digestion), poor vision, joint pain, diabetes, anemia and 
hypertension [10,43], toothache, hemorrhoids, uterine disorder [10,44]. In a well known practice, 
Moringa seeds are used to sediment impurities of water [10]. 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12798 
 
 
Roots are soaked in water or alcohol and boiled with other herbs to obtained drinks and infusions as 
remedies for toothache, as anthelmintic and antiparalytic [10,41,42] drugs and as sex enhancers. 
Finally, flowers are used to produce aphrodisiac substances and to treat inflammations, muscle 
diseases, hysteria, tumors and enlargement of the spleen [42,44]. 
5. Non Food or Medicinal Uses 
Beyond the uses of Moringa as a food and for human health, other possible uses exist. It can be 
used as a natural plant growth enhancer; indeed leaves are rich in zeatin (a plant hormone belong  
to the cytokinin group). Leaf extracts can stimulate plant growth and increasing crop yield.  
Researches performed using a spray based on leaf extracts of wheat, maize and rice support the wide 
range of beneficial effect on crops [46]. 
Moringa seed powder can be used for water purification, replacing dangerous and expensive 
chemicals such as aluminum sulfate [10]. 
Interestingly, leaf extracts and also seed extracts show biopesticide activity, effective against larvae 
and adults of Trigoderma granarium and can reduce the incidence of fungi on groundnut seeds [46]. 
One of the interesting applications of Moringa seeds is their utilization as biomass for  
biodiesel production. 
Due to the increasing energy demand and environmental problems associated with fossil fuels, the 
improvement of alternative fuels and renewable sources of energy is required. Biodiesel can replace 
petroleum-derived oil (petrodiesel), without any sulphur or aromatic compound and with lower 
emission of monoxides, hydrocarbons and particulates. Furthermore, biodiesel can reduce dependence 
on imported fuels: a crucial problem in developing countries [47]. 
Moringa seeds have an oil content of 30%–40%, with a high-quality fatty acid composition  
i.e., high oleic acid (>70%) [48]. In addition they posses significant resistance to oxidative 
degradation. These proprieties make Moringa oil a good candidate to produce biodiesel after 
transesterificaton [48–50]. Biswas and John [51], in a study conducted in Australia, report that 
approximately 3030 kg of oil are required to produce 1000 liters of biodiesel. Furthermore, an 
equivalent of 3.03 tonnes/ha of oil seeds can be harvested from dry land, and 6.06 tonnes/ha can be 
harvested from irrigated land. Since biodiesel production with Moringa seed oil is a second generation 
production (i.e., not in direct competition with existing farmland and with food crops) and as Moringa 
can grown on degraded land, studies suggest that Moringa biodiesel is an acceptable substitute to fossil 
fuels, even when compared against biodiesel derived from vegetable oil of other species. 
6. Phytochemistry 
As Moringa oleifera leaves are most used part of the plant, we review articles concerning 
phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of leaves. 
Several bioactive compounds were recognized in the leaves of Moringa oleifera. They are  
grouped as vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenol, phenolic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, glucosinolates, 
isothiocyanates, tannins, saponins and oxalates and phytates (Figure 2). The amounts of different 
bioactive compounds found in Moringa oleifera leaves and reported in literature are summarized in

6.1. Vitamins 
Fresh leaves of Moringa oleifera are reported to contain 11,300–23,000 IU of vitamin A [14,52]. 
Vitamin A plays key roles in many physiological processes such as vision, reproduction, embryonic 
growth and development, immune competence, cell differentiation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, 
maintenance of epithelial tissue, and brain function. Its deficiency is still prevalent in many developing 
countries, and considered responsible for child and maternal mortality [79]. 
Fresh leaves of Moringa oleifara are also a good source of carotenoids with pro-vitamin A action. 
They contain 6.6–6.8 mg/100 g [53,62] of β-carotene, greater that carrots, pumpkin and apricots  
(6.9, 3.6 and 2.2 mg/100 g, respectively) [80]. 
β-carotene is more concentrated in the dried leaves, with amounts ranging from 17.6 to 39.6 mg/100 g 
of dry weight (DW) [53,55,61]. This wide range may be explained by the different environmental 
conditions existing among different origin countries, genetic of the plant, drying method [55] and the 
different extraction and analysis methods employed as well. Freeze-drying seems to be the most 
conservative dehydration method. In freeze-drying leaves the β-carotene content is approximately  
66 mg/100 g [57]. 
Moringa oleifera is an interesting source of vitamin C. Fresh leaves contain approximately  
200 mg/100 g [14], greater than orange [80]. These amounts are of particular interest, as the vitamin C 
intervenes in the synthesis and metabolism of many compounds, like tyrosine, folic acid and 
tryptophan, hydroxylation of glycine, proline, lysine carnitine and catecholamine. It facilitates the 
conversion of cholesterol into bile acids and hence lowers blood cholesterol levels and increases the 
absorption of iron in the gut by reducing ferric to ferrous state. Finally, it acts as antioxidant, 
protecting the body from various deleterious effects of free radicals, pollutants and toxins [81]. 
However, being vitamin C sensitive to heat and oxygen, it is rapidly oxidized, so much so that its 
concentration in the Moringa oleifera dried leaves is lower than in the fresh leaves, dropping to 18.7 to 
140 mg/100 g of DW [53,55,56]. 
Difference in (i) environmental conditions in the various origin countries; (ii) genetic of the plant; 
(iii) drying method [55] and (iv) different extraction and analysis methods, may explain the wide range 
of vitamin C content in Moringa leaves reported in literature. Freeze-drying seem to better preserve 
vitamin C from oxidation, so much so that greater amounts of this vitamin were found in leaves 
undergone to freeze-drying soon after the collection. In these latter, vitamin C concentration ranges 
between 271 and 920 mg/100 g of DW [57,58]. 
Moringa oleifera fresh leaves are a good source of vitamin E (in particular α-tocopherol) and 
contain approximately 9.0 mg/100 g [59] of this compound, similarly to nuts [80]. Vitamin E acts mainly 
as liposoluble antioxidants, but it is also involved in the modulation of gene expression, inhibition of  
cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, monocyte adhesion and regulation of bone mass [82].  
Drying procedure determines a concentration of vitamin E up to values of 74.45–122.16 mg/100 g of 
DW [53,60,61]. 
Among vitamins of group B, only thiamine, riboflavin and niacin seem present in Moringa oleifera 
leaves. These vitamins mainly act as cofactors of many enzymes involved in the metabolism of 
nutrients and energy production, and their concentration in fresh leaves ranges between 0.06 and  
0.6 mg/100 g, 0.05 and 0.17 mg/100 g and 0.8 and 0.82 mg/100 g for thiamine, riboflavin and niacin, 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12812 
 
 
respectively [14,53,60], similarly to fruits and vegetable [80]. Only one study reported the contribution 
of vitamin B1, B2 and B3 of dried leaves of Moringa oleifera [53]. Their concentrations were 2.85, 
22.16 and 8.86 mg/100g of DW, respectively. However, the amount of riboflavin in dried leaves seems 
very high compared to that of fresh leaves. Further studies are needed to confirm these values. Finally, 
Girija et al. showed an appreciable physiological availability of these three vitamins in leaves of 
Moringa oleifera (61.6%, 51.5% and 39.9%, respectively) [54]. 
We did not find studies about other vitamin of group B or vitamin D and K in Moringa oleifera 
leave; therefore further studies on this topic are needed. 
6.2. Polyphenols 
Moringa oleifera dried leaves are a great source of polyphenols. Their concentrations range  
from 2090 to 12,200 mgGAE/100 g of DW [63–67] (or 1600 to 3400 mgTAE/100g of DW) [68,69].  
These amounts are greater than those found in fruits and vegetable [83–85]. The different 
environmental conditions in the various origin countries, the harvesting season [56], the genetic of the 
plant, the drying method, the leaf maturity stage [63] and the extractive method used [67] may explain 
such wide range of reported values. Principal polyphenol compounds in Moringa oleifera leaves are 
flavonoids and phenolic acids. 
6.3. Flavonoids 
Flavonoids are a sub-group of polyphenolic compounds having a benzo-γ-pyrone structure  
and are ubiquitous in plants, as they are synthesized in response to microbial infections [86]. 
Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that high intake of flavonoids has protective effects 
against many infectious (bacterial and viral diseases) and degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular 
diseases, cancers, and other age-related diseases [86,87]. Moringa oleifera leaves are an interesting 
source of flavonoids compounds. Total flavonoids concentration in dried leaves ranges from 5.059  
to 12.16 mg/g of DW [71], namely, close to or larger than that in many fruits and vegetable  
normally consumed [72,88]. These values are indeed the overall sum of the amounts of single 
flavonoids. However, some flavonoids were studied only by some authors and, therefore, these 
amounts may be inaccurate. The total concentration of flavonoids in freeze-dried leaves ranges from 
21.0 to 61.62 mgRE/g of DW [57,58]. Myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol are the main flavonoids 
found in Moringa oleifera leaves. In dried leaves, myricetin concentration is approximately  
5.804 mg/g of DW, while quercetin and kaempferol concentrations range from 0.207 to 7.57 mg/g of 
DW and not detectable amounts (ND) to 4.59 mg/g of DW, respectively [64–66,71,72,74].  
Higher amounts were found in freeze-dried leaves. In particular, quercitin and kaempferol 
concentrations range from 5.47 to 16.64 mg/g and 1.5 to 3.5 mg/g of DW, respectively [58,73,75]. 
Isorhamnetin concentration in dried leaves is approximately 0.118 mg/g of DW [71], while, in  
freeze-dried leaves, its concentration is up to 7 times larger, ranging from 0.52 to 0.72 mg/g of  
DW [73]. Other flavonoids, such as luteolin, apigenin, daidzein and genistein, were found in not 
detectable concentrations in Moringa oleifera leaves [65,71]. However these compounds were 
investigated only in few studies and, therefore, further investigations are needed. In addition, in this 
case, the high inter-studies variations for these compounds may be explained taking into account 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12813 
 
 
different environmental conditions, harvesting season, genetic of the plant, drying method, leaf 
maturity stage, extraction method used and, finally, the different sensitivity of the analytical methods. 
6.4. Phenolic Acids 
Phenolic acids are a sub-group of phenolic compounds derived from hydroxybenzoic acid and 
hydroxycinnamic acid, naturally present in plants. Thanks to their documented effects on human 
health, the contribution of food-supplied phenolic acids is a subject of increasing interest. In particular, 
these compounds are mainly studied for their documented antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
antimutagenic and anticancer properties [89–92]. Particularly abundant in fruit and vegetables, 
phenolic acids were found in great amounts in Moringa oleifera leaves too. In dried leaves, gallic acid 
seems to be the most abundant, with a concentration of approximately 1.034 mg/g of DW [64,66], 
although Bajpai et al. [65] only found poorly detectable amounts. The concentration of chlorogenic 
and caffeic acids ranges from 0.018 to 0.489 mg/g of DW and ND to 0.409 mg/g of DW,  
respectively [64–66]. Lower, but appreciable, concentrations were found for ellagic and ferulic acids. 
Their concentrations range from ND to 0.189 mg/g and 0.078 to 0.128 mg/g of DW, respectively [64–66]. 
Some of these compounds were found more concentrated in freeze-dried leaves. Specifically,  
Zhang et al. [57], in leaves harvested in Florida and subsequently freeze-dried, found approximately 
6.457 mg/g of DW of o-coumaric acid and 0.536 mg/g of DW of caffeic acid, while p-coumaric, 
synaptic, gentistic and syringic acids were found in poorly detectable amounts [57]. Like for the 
flavonoids, the different environmental conditions, harvesting season, genetic of the plant, drying 
method, leaf maturity stage, extraction method used and the different sensitivity of the analytical 
methods may have contributed to the high inter-study variation in the concentrations of phenolic acids 
in Moringa oleifera leaves. 
6.5. Alkaloids 
Alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen 
atoms. This nitrogen may occur in the form of a primary amine (RNH2), a secondary amine (R2NH) or a 
tertiary amine (R3N). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, most alkaloids contain oxygen [93]. 
Alkaloids are of particular interest thanks to their pharmacological properties. The presence of these 
compounds has been confirmed in Moringa oleifera leaves [45,63]. Several of these compounds, such 
as N,α-L-rhamnopyranosyl vincosamide, 4-(α-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy) phenylacetonitrile (niazirin), 
pyrrolemarumine 4′′-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside, 4′-hydroxy phenylethanamide-α-L-rhamnopyranoside 
(marumoside A) and its 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-derivative (marumoside B) and methyl  
4-(α-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzylcarbamate, have been isolated in Moringa oleifera leaves [94,95]. 
However, their amounts in the leaves are still unknown. 
6.6. Glucosinolates and Isothiocyanates 
Glucosinolates are a group of secondary metabolites in plants. Structurally they are β-S-glucosides 
of thio-oxime-O-sulfates and synthesized from amino acids. Appreciable amounts of these compounds 
were found in Moringa oleifera leaves. In particular, around 116 and 63 mg/g of DW in young and 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12814 
 
 
older leaves, respectively, are reported [75,96]. These amounts are close to, and in some case larger 
than, those found in many cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, radish), mainly sources of 
these compounds [97]. 4-O-(α-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolate has been identified as the 
dominant leaf glucosinolate of Moringa oleifera and is accompanied by lower levels of three isomeric 
4-O-(α-L-acetylrhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolates, which reflect the three position of the 
acetyl group at the rhamnose moiety of the molecule [75,96]. The concentrations of these compounds 
seem affected by the physiological stage of the plant and by the maturity stage of the leaves. The 
concentration of 4-O-(α-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolate ranges from 21.84 to 59.4 mg/g 
of DW, while the concentrations of the three isomer of 4-O-(α-L-acetylrhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl 
glucosinolates range from 2.16 to 5.0 mg/g of DW, 1.2 to 1.8 mg/g of DW and 12.76 to 50.2 mg/g of 
DW for isomer 1, 2 and 3, respectively [73,75]. Amaglo et al. [73] report the presence of  
4-hydroxybenzyl (sinalbin), with a concentration ranging between ND and 2.36 mg/g of DW. 
Glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed by myrosinase to produce D-glucose and various other degradation 
products like isothiocyanates [98], which are also present in Moringa oleifera leaves [99,100]. Both 
glucosinolates and isothiocyanates play an important role in health promoting and prevention of 
disease [101]. 
6.7. Tannins 
Tannins are water-soluble phenolic compounds that bind to and precipitate alkaloids, gelatin and other 
proteins. They exhibit various biological properties: anti-cancer, antiatherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-hepatoxic, antibacterial and anti-HIV replication activity [102]. Moringa oleifera leaves are an 
appreciable source of tannins. Their concentrations range between 13.2 and 20.6 gTAE/kg [68,69,76] 
in dried leaves and between 5.0 and 12.0 gTAE/kg in freeze-dried leaves [77,78]. These amounts are 
greater than concentrations found in nuts [103], similar to those found in some plants [104] and  
berries [105], but much lower compared to the concenctrations found in other medicinal plants [106]. 
6.8. Saponins 
Saponins are a group of natural compounds that consist of an isoprenoidal-derived aglycone, 
designated genin or sapogenin, covalently linked to one or more sugar moieties [107]. Even though 
some saponins have hemolytic side effects, they are studied for their anti-cancer properties [108,109]. 
Moringa oleifera leaves are a good source of saponins. Their concentration in dried leaves is 
approximately 50 gDE/kg of DW [69], while in freeze-dried leaves it ranges between 64 and 81 gDE/kg 
of DW [77,78]. These amounts are greater than the concentrations found in other plants [106], but 
slighty lower than ginseng root [110], one of the mainly source of these compounds. 
6.9. Oxalates and Phytates 
Oxalates and phytates are anti-nutritional compounds as they bind minerals inhibiting the intestinal 
absorption. Moringa oleifera leaves present high contents of these compunds. Oxalates content of  
dried leaves range from 430 to 1050 mg/100 g of DW [55,76], similar to other plants rich in these 
compounds [111], while phytates concentration range from 25 to 31 g/kg of DW [69] in dried leaves 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12815 
 
 
and from 21 and 23 g/kg of DW in freeze-dried leaves [77,78]. These amounts are greater than those 
found in legumes and cereals [112,113], but lower than brans [112]. 
7. Pharmacology 
7.1. Antioxidant Properties 
Moringa oleifera leaves are a rich source of antioxidant compounds [114]. 
Many in vitro studies on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves are available in  
literature [56,58,63–65,67,70,115–119]. Siddhuraju and Becker [58] examined the radical scavenging 
capacities and antioxidant activities of the aqueous, aqueous methanol, and aqueous ethanol extracts of 
freeze-dried leaves of Moringa oleifera from different agro-climatic regions. The authors found that 
different leaves extracts inhibited 89.7%–92.0% peroxidation of linoleic acid and had a scavenging 
activity on superoxide radicals in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 within the range of 0.08–0.2 mg/mL, 
with the exception of water extract from Indian leaves which has an EC50 > 0.3 mg/mL). All of the 
solvent extracts of leaf samples had a very high radical scavenging activity, however better results 
were obtained in methanol and ethanol extracts. Both methanol and ethanol extracts of Indian origins 
showed the highest antioxidant activities, 65.1% and 66.8%, respectively, in the β-carotene-linoleic 
acid system. Nonetheless, increasing concentration of all the extracts had significantly increased 
reducing power (FRAP). The authors concluded that both methanol (80%) and ethanol (70%) were the 
best solvents for the extraction of antioxidant compounds from Moringa oleifera leaves. Similar results 
were obtained by Vongsak et al. [70] who measured antioxidant activity using various extraction 
methods on Thai Moringa oleifera leaves. The authors found that the extract obtained macerating dried 
leaves with 70% ethanol exhibited high DPPH-scavenging activity (EC50 = 62.94 g/mL) and the 
highest FRAP value (51.50 mmol FeSO4 equivalents/100 g extract). Iqbal and Bhanger [56]  
showed that season and agroclimatic locations have profound effect on the antioxidant activity of 
Moringa oleifera leaves. In this study, the authors collected the leaves in the months of December, 
March, June, and September from five different areas of Pakistan, and found that the overall 
antioxidant efficacy was greater in December or March depending upon location, and least in June. 
The authors suggested that the environmental temperature and, most likely, the soil properties have 
significant effects on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves. The effect of season on 
antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves was also found by Shih et al. [115] in leaves collected 
in Taiwan. The results of this study showed that the winter samples (DPPH-radical scavenging  
EC50 = 200 μg/mL) of Moringa oleifera leaves had a significant stronger antioxidant activity than 
summer samples (DPPH-radical scavenging EC50 = 387 μg/mL). Finally, Sreelatha and Padma [63] 
evaluated the antioxidant activity of leaves collected in India in two stages of maturity. The analysis 
revealed only minor, but significant; differences in the two maturity stages, mature and tender leaves, 
for the DPPH scavenging activity (EC50 = 18.15 vs. 19.12 μg/mL), superoxide scavenging activity 
(EC50 = 12.71 vs. 15.51 μg/mL), nitric oxide scavenging activity (EC50 = 56.77 vs. 65.88 μg/mL) and 
for lipid peroxidation inhibition (EC50 = 25.32 vs. 30.15 μg/mL). 
Verma et al. [120] examinated the effects of administration of 50 and 100 mg/kg bw/day of ethyl 
acetate/polyphenolic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves for 14 days on markers of oxidative stress in 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12816 
 
 
mice treated with CCl4. The authors observed that the supplementation with Moringa oleifera leaves 
extract in CCl4-intoxicated rats prevented the increment of lipid peroxide oxidation (LPO) levels, the 
decrement of glutathione (GSH) concentration and in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD)  
and catalase (CAT) antioxidant enzymes in liver and kidney compared to negative control.  
Interestingly, the effects obtained in the group treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day of leaves extract were 
comparable to those obtained in the standard group treated with 50 mg/kg bw/day of vitamin E. 
Similarly, Luqman et al. [121] studied the effects of administration of increasing amounts of both 
aqueous and alcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves on markers of oxidative stress in Swiss 
albino mice. The authors observed an enhancement of GSH concentration in mice erythrocytes treated 
with the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves. The observed rise is consistent with the increase 
in the dose of the extract. Similarly, the dose-responsive effect on LPO was also observed. Moreover, 
the basal value of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was maintained in case of the aqueous 
extract of Moringa oleifera leaves. Milder, but appreciable, results were obtained using ethanolic  
extract. Moyo et al. [122] studied the antioxidant properties of diet supplemented with Moringa oleifera 
dried leaves in goats model. The authors found a significant increment of the activity of GSH in goats 
supplemented with Moringa leaves as compared with the control group. In comparison, the activities 
of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) of diet supplemented with Moringa oleifera  
were increased appreciably than the goats fed with ordinary feed. Finally, the supplementation of 
Moringa oleifera leaves inhibited the amount of MDA generated in liver homogenate. Therefore, also 
the consumption of Moringa oleifera leaves could protect the animals against diseases induced by 
oxidative stress. Finally, the administration of Moringa oleifera leaves extract seems to prevent also 
the oxidative damages caused by high-fat diet. Das et al. [123] reported a lower MDA concentration,  
a higher GSH concentration and hepatic FRAP in mice fed with high-fat diet and supplemented with 
Moringa oleifera leaves extract compared to mice only treated with high-fat diet. 
Only one study reported the effects of Moringa oleifera leaves extract on oxidative modification of 
LDL using an “ex vivo” assay [114]. In this study, human plasma was collected and preincubated at  
37 °C for 1 h with various concentrations of freeze-dried Moringa oleifera leaves extract (1, 10, 30 and 
50 µg/mL). Control group was treated with vitamin E as standard antioxidant. Oxidation reaction of 
LDL was initiated by adding freshly prepared 10 µM CuSO4 to the samples. This experiment showed 
that in the presence of Moringa oleifera leaves extract the oxidative modifications of human plasma 
LDL were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of the leaves extract at  
a final concentration of 1, 10, 30, and 50 g/mL, the lag-time of conjugated diene formation was 
increased to 45.0, 151.66, 251.67, and 340.33 min, respectively with an IC50 at 2 h of 5 µg/mL. 
Moreover, in the presence of Moringa oleifera leaves extract at a final concentration of 1 and 10 g/mL, 
the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, products of lipid peroxidation) formation was 
reduced to 104.16 and 2.80 nmol/mg LDL protein, respectively. Interestingly, the incubation with 
higher concentrations of the leaf extract completely blocked TBARS formation. These findings 
indicate that Moringa oleifera leaves extract could suppress the initiation and propagation of lipid 
peroxidation also in humans. 
In conclusion, many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown antioxidant properties of  
Moringa oleifera leaves. These findings may be explained by the abundant amounts of antioxidant 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12817 
 
 
compounds in the leaves. However further studies in human are needed to confirm the results obtained 
in animals. 
7.2. Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Properties 
Inflammation is a protective immunovascular response that involves immune cells, blood vessels, 
and molecular mediators. The purpose of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, 
clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and 
to initiate tissue repair. 
The anti-inflammatory properties of Moringa oleifera seeds have been so far reported in a number 
of studies, while only few studies on anti-inflammatory effect of leaves are available in the literature. 
Coppin et al. [72] found that 2 on 3 samples of Moringa oleifera leaves were able to inhibit nitric 
oxide (NO) production by macrophage cells after treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
whereas the third sample was found not active. The authors attributed this difference to genetics and 
chemistry of plants which can significantly vary even within the same species. Kooltheat et al. [124] 
found that the ethyl acetate extract of Moringa oleifera leaves was able to inhibits human macrophage 
cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8) induced by extract of cigarette smoke and by LPS, similar 
to Aspirin (reference drug). Finally, Waterman et al. [100] observed that both Moringa oleifera 
concentrate and isothiocyanates isolated from the leaves significantly decreased gene expression and 
production of inflammatory markers in RAW macrophages. Specifically, both attenuated expression of 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1β and production of NO and TNFα at 1 and 5 μM. 
Sudha et al. [125] and Gupta et al. [126] evaluated the immunomodulatory effect of methanolic  
and ethanolic extracts of Moringa oleifera leaves, respectively, in cyclophosphamide-induced 
immunodeficient mice. These authors found that Moringa oleifera leaves extract shown a significant 
increase in white blood cells, percent neutrophils and serum immunoglobulins, suggesting that it 
stimulate both cellular and humoral immune response. These results were confirmed by other  
studies [127–129]. Rajanandh et al. [130] evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of extract of 
Moringa oleifera leaves in rats fed with an atherogenic diet in order to induce hyperlipidemia. In this 
study, rats were fed with 100 and 200 mg/kg bw of hydro alcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves 
for a period of 28 days. At the end of the experiment, serum TNF-α and IL-1 were significantly lower 
in rats treated with both doses of hydro-alcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves compared to 
control. Recently, Waterman et al. [99] evaluated the effect of supplementation of Moringa oleifera 
leaves concentrate in obese-induced mice with very high-fat diet (60% kcal from fat) for 12 weeks.  
In the experimental group, the very high-fat diet contained 5% of Moringa oleifera leaves concentrate. 
The authors observed a reduction of gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers, TNFα, IL-6 and 
IL-1β in the liver and ileum tissues in mice treated with Moringa oleifera concentrate compared to the 
control group. Similarly, in adipose tissue, gene expression of TNFα was reduced while adiponectin 
had enhanced expression in the treated mice compared to the controls. Finally, Das et al. [131] tested 
the anti-inflammatory effects of both Moringa oleifera leaves extract and quercitin in mice fed with 
high-fat diet. The authors found that both Moringa oleifera leaves extract and quercitin inhibited  
the translocation of p65 subunit of NF-κB (4.2- and 2.3-fold reduction in the expression level, 
respectively) in comparison with the group only fed with high-fat diet. Moreover, both Moringa oleifera 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12818 
 
 
leaves extract and quercitin down-regulated the expressions of iNOS, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and C 
reactive protein (CRP) compared to the group only fed with high-fat diet. Finally, release of serum 
inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 potently decreased in the group treated with the extract (30% 
and 27% reduction for TNF-a and IL-6, respectively) and in the group treated with quercitin (27% and 
21% reduction for TNF-a and IL-6, respectively) in comparison to the HFD group. 
In conclusion, many in vitro and in vivo studies in animal model have demonstrated the  
anti-inflammatory and immunodulatory effects of a supplementation with Moringa oleifera leaves. 
Many bioactive compounds may be involved in the anti-inflammatory process. Among them, quercetin 
seems to inhibit activation of NF-kB and also the subsequent NF-kB-dependent downstream events and 
inflammation [131]. However, many other bioactive compounds naturally present in Moringa oleifera 
leaves, such as other flavonoids and phenolic acids, may be involved in to anti-inflammatory process. 
Further studies should be devoted to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory action and the 
mechanism of action of other bioactive compound naturally present in Moringa oleifera leaves. 
Concerning immunomodulatory process, the exact mechanism of action of the extract of Moringa 
oleifera leaves in stimulation of both cellular and the humoral immunity is not clear yet [126]. 
Therefore, further studies on this subject are needed. Finally, human studies are needed to evaluate the 
anti-inflammatory and immunomudulatory properties of Moringa oleifera leaves also in human beings. 
7.3. Hypoglycemic Properties 
Hypoglycemic effects of Moringa oleifera leaves are reported in literature [132]. 
In the study of Ndong et al. [133], male spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and  
non-diabetic male Wistar rats received a single dose of glucose solution and a dose Moringa oleifera 
leaves (2 g/kg BW and 200 mg/kg BW, respectively), whereas control groups of both animals only 
received a single dose of glucose solution. Blood glucose concentration was measured at 0, 10, 20, 30, 
45, 60, 90 and 120 min. Results from OGTT shown that Moringa oleifera significantly decreased 
blood glucose at 20, 30, 45, and 60 min in GK rats compared to the control and at 10, 30 and 45 min 
Wistar rats compared to the control after glucose administration. Moreover, in GK rats, the treatment 
with Moringa oleifera leaves reduced AUC values by 23%, whereas it did not significantly affect  
these values in control rats. These results suggest that Moringa oleifera has a glucose intolerance 
ameliorating effect in both GK and Wistar rats, with a greater action in diabetic than in normoglycemic 
rats. Kar et al. [134] tested hypoglycaemic activity of ethanol extract (95%) of some Indian medicinal 
plants, including Moringa oleifera, in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The authors found that a single 
dose of 250 mg/kg BW of leaves extract determined a halving of serum glucose in a week. In the study 
of Jaiswal et al. [135], the effect of the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves on glucose 
homeostasis was tested in healthy and streptozotocin-induced sub, mild and severely diabetic Wistar 
rats (STZ, a cytotoxic drug that selectively destroys islet β cells). The dose of 200 mg/kg BW of leaves 
extract determined a maximum fall of 26.7% in fasting blood glucose concentration and a maximum 
fall of 29.9% in OGGT at 3 h after glucose administration. The same dose determined a maximum fall 
of 31.1% and 32.8% in OGGT in sub and mild diabetic rats, respectively. Severely diabetic rat were, 
instead, long treated (21 days) with aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves. The experiment 
revealed a fall of 25.9%, 53.5%, 69.2% in fasting blood glucose at 7, 14 and 21 days treatment with 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12819 
 
 
leaf extract. Interestingly, results obtained in sub, mild and severely diabetic rats were similar to those 
obtained in Glipizide treated rats (2.5 mg/kg BW, reference drug). Similar results were obtained by 
Edoga et al. [136]. In this study, the aqueous extract produced a dose-dependent reduction in blood 
glucose levels of normoglycemic and hyperglycemic rats. In normoglycemic rats, the aqueous extract 
of Moringa oleifera (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) exhibited a reduction of 23.14%, 27.05% and 33.18% 
respectively of the blood glucose levels within 6 hours of administration, while in alloxan-induced 
diabetic rats the reduction were of 33.29%, 40.69% and 44.06% respectively. Interestingly, also in this 
study, similar results were obtained using 200 mg/kg of tolbutamide (reference drug). Divi et al. [137] 
tested the antidiabetic properties of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves in fructose-induced 
insulin-resistant (IR) and STZ-induced diabetic rats. After administration of 200 mg/kg BW of 
aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves for 60 days the authors observed a decrease in blood 
glucose concentration in both groups and a decrease of insulin in IR group compared to respectively 
control. The hypoglycemic effect of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves in STZ-induced 
diabetic rats was also confirmed by Yassa et al. [138]. Moreover, in this study histopathological 
damage of islet cells was also markedly reversed. Moringa oleifera treatment significantly increased 
the areas of positive purple modified Gomori stained β-cells (from 60% to 91%) and decreased the 
area percentage of collagen fibers (from 199% to 120%) compared to control values. All these findings 
were confirmed by other studies using similar approach [139–141]. 
William et al. [142] examined the effects of Moringa oleifera leaves added to a standardized meal 
on serum post-prandial glucose concentration at 1 and 2 h from the consumption, compared to the 
standard meal alone or a 75 g oral glucose load in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Compared to the 
glucose load, standard meals with or without vegetable supplements induced a significantly lower  
post-prandial glucose response as derived from AUCs. However, leaf-supplemented meals caused a 
lower response (−21%) compared to standard meals alone. Moreover, plasma insulin AUCs did not 
differ significantly between the two meals, suggesting that the hypoglycemic effect of Moringa oleifera 
leaves supplementation was not due to increased insulin secretion. Kumari [143] examined the 
hypoglycemic effect of 40-days administration of Moringa oleifera leaves in non-insulin dependent 
type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects aged 30–60 years old. Recruited subjects were divided in 
experimental and control group: the first received 8 g of dried Moringa oleifera leaves for 40 days, 
whereas the control group didn’t receive any treatment. Daily meals were comparable between the two 
groups in terms of relative food type consumption, nutrients and calories as well. Fasting and  
post-prandial blood glucose concentrations were taken at baseline and at the end of the experiment. 
Fasting and post-prandial blood glucose did not differ much from baseline in the control group, while 
they were significantly reduced in the experimental group (−28% and −26%, respectively). Finally, 
Ghiridhari et al. [144] recruited a group of 60 normal weight type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, aged 
40–58  years old, on sulfonylurea medication and a standardized calorie-restricted diet (1500 to 1800 Kcal). 
The patients were equally divided into an experimental and a control groups. Patients in the 
experimental group were prescribed an unspecified amount of Moringa oleifera leaf for 90 days.  
The results showed that post prandial blood glucose of experimental group initially was 210 mg/dL 
and it reduced to 191, 174 and 150 mg/dL respectively after the first, second and third month of 
supplementation (with a significant decrease of 9%, 17% and 29%, respectively). In control group post 
prandial blood glucose level of 179 mg/dL was substantially maintained during the whole experiment. 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12820 
 
 
Similar trends were observed for glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c). In the experimental group initial 
value of 7.81% significantly decreased to 7.4% after the supplementation period, whereas it did not 
change in the control group. The results indicated that Moringa oleifera leaves are a suitable to reduce 
the diabetic complications in diabetic patients. However, it should be noted that treatment allocation to 
patients appear to have not been randomized as baseline values for the two parameters were higher  
in the experimental group than in the control group, 7.8% ± 0.5% vs. 7.4% ± 0.6% for HbA1c and  
210 ± 49 vs. 179 ± 36 mg/dL for post-prandial glucose response [132]. Finally, it has been suggested 
that isothicyanates isolated from Moringa oleifera leaves reduced glucose production in liver cells, 
showing activity at very low concentrations and being close to two orders of magnitude more active 
than metformin. These compounds were able to decrease phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and 
glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression suggesting that they act via blocking these rate-limiting steps 
in liver gluconeogenesis [99]. 
In conclusion, scientific evidences suggest a potential use of Moringa oleifera leaves in the 
treatment of diabetes. Many compounds isolated in Moringa oleifera leaves may be involved in the 
glucose homeostasis. Among theme, isothiocyanates seem to reduce insulin resistance and hepatic 
gluconeogenesis [99]. However, also polyphenol compounds abundant in Moringa oleifera leaves, 
such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, may contribute to its effects on glucose homeostasis.  
These compounds exert, indeed, anti-diabetic effects targeting various cellular signaling pathways in 
pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue. In particular, they influence β-cell mass and 
function, as well as energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Their effects may 
be due to antioxidant, enzyme inhibition, receptor agonist or antagonist activity or through novel 
mechanisms yet to be elucidated [145–149]. Phenolic compounds, flavonoids and tannins may be also 
involved in the ability of Moringa oleifera leaves extract to inhibit the intestinal sucrase and, slightly, 
the pancreatic α-amylase actions [150]. Finally, even though studies on human being highlight the 
hypoglycemic effects of Moringa oleifera leaves, further larger randomized studies controlled for 
potential confounders, such as sex, age, race, nutritional status and dietary habits in human are required 
before using the leaves as herbal drug for the treatment of diabetes. 
7.4. Hypolipidemic Properties 
Hypolipidemic effects of Moringa oleifera leaves are reported in literature [132]. 
Chumark et al. [114] examined the hypolidipemic effects of Moringa oleifera leaves in rabbits  
fed with high-cholesterol diet (5%) for 12 weeks. A group was concomitantly treated with  
Moringa oleifera leaves extract (0.1 g/kg BW/day). At the end of the experiment, rabbits treated with 
Moringa oleifera leaves presented a total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides significantly 
reduced of 52%, 42.7%, 44.2% and 75.4% respectively, compared to rabbits only fed with  
high-cholesterol diet, with consequent reduction of 86.52% of internal carotid atherosclerotic plaque 
formation. Similar trends were observed in the group treated with 5 mg/kg BW of simvastatin (reference 
drug). The anti-dyslipidemic effects of Moringa oleifera leaves were also examined in rats fed with  
a high-fat diet [151]. In this study, Wistar rats were fed for 30 days with a high-fat diet containing  
20% (w/w) fat. Animals were divided in two groups, one of which received a daily dose of 1 g/kg BW 
of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves. The authors observed a significant lower increasing of 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12821 
 
 
serum cholesterol in treated compared to untreated rats, but not in liver and kidney. The percentage 
decrease in serum, liver and kidney was 14.35%, 6.40% and 11.09%, respectively. Similarly,  
Jain et al. [152], fed albino rats, for 30 days, with a high-fat diet containing 26% fat. In this case, three 
groups received different doses of methanolic extracts of Moringa oleifera leaves (150, 300, or  
600 mg/kg bw/die), one group was treated with 4 mg/kg of simvastatin, whereas another group didn’t 
receive any supplementation. Treatment with methanolic extract, at three different doses significantly 
decreased the levels of total cholesterol and LDL as compare to the controls. The same was true for 
VLDL treating rats with the medium and the highest doses of methanolic extracts. Interestingly, the 
medium and the highest doses of methanolic extracts determined a significant increment of HDL. 
Similar results were obtained treating rats with simvastatin. In addition, Bais et al. [153] has recently 
shown that a supplementation of 200 and 400 mg/kg bw/die of Moringa oleifera leaves extract 
exhibited anti-obesity effects in high-fat fed mice. Lower food intake was observed in the groups 
treated with Moringa oleifera leaves extract when compared to the group feed with only high-fat diet. 
Subsequently, the body weight gain in these groups was significantly lower than the rats feed with only 
high-fat diet. All these findings were confirmed by other studies using similar approaches [130,153,154]. 
Other studies evaluated the hypolipidemic effects of Moringa oleifera leaves supplementation in 
diabetes-induced rats. Diabetes is indeed a risk condition to develop dyslipidemia. Oyedepo et al. [140] 
evaluated the effect of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves on plasma total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, HDL and LDL in alloxan-induced diabetic male rats. Diabetic rats were feed with  
400 mg/kg BW of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves for 28 day. At the end of the experiment 
diabetic rats presented lower plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, but not higher HDL, than 
diabetic rats untreated. Divi et al. [137] observed a decrease of triglycerides (60.1% and 56.4%), total 
cholesterol (28.8% and 18.0%), LDL (31.2% and 13.9%) and VLDL (60.4% and 56.5%) in both 
fructose-induced insulin resistant and stz-induced diabetic rats treated with Moringa oleifera leaves 
extract compared to respectively untreated control. Interestingly, an increment of HDL was observed 
only in diabetic rats (40.4%), but in IR rats in which a decrement (10.3%) was observed. Similar 
results were obtained by other studies [141]. 
Nambiar et al. [155] firstly examined the potential anti-dyslipidemic effect of Moringa oleifera 
leaves in 35 hyperlipidemic subjects. Subjects were divided control (18 subjects) and experimental  
(17 subjects) groups. Groups were similar for anthropometric values (age, height, weight, body mass 
index, waist/hip ratio) and their daily nutrient intake. The experimental group was treated with 4.4 g of 
dehydrated Moringa oleifera leaves, as four 550 mg tablets twice daily, for 50 days. Plasma lipid 
profiles were determined at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The authors observed  
a significant decrease of 1.6% in plasma total cholesterol and an increment of 6.3% of HDL in 
experimental group compared to control group. Not significant trends were observed for LDL, VLDL, 
and triglycerides. However, the TC/HDL ratio significantly decreased by 6.6%, indicating that the 
treatment induced a lesser atherogenic lipid profile. Kumari [143] observed a significant decrease of 
total cholesterol (14%), LDL (29%), VLDL (15%) and triglycerides (14%) in diabetic subjects treated 
with 8 g of Moringa oleifera leaves for 40 days compared to untreated subjects. However, not 
significant increase of HDL was observed. 
In conclusion, scientific evidences suggest a positive effect of Moringa oleifera leaves on lipid 
homeostasis. Many bioactive compounds may contribute to these effects. It has been suggested that 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12822 
 
 
phenolic compounds, in particular flavonoids, play important roles on lipid regulation [156]. 
Moreover, phenolic compounds of Moringa oleifera leaves extract seem to be involved in the 
inhibition of pancreatic cholesterol esterase activity reducing and delaying the cholesterol absorption, 
and binding bile acids by forming insoluble complexes and increasing their fecal excretion with 
theoretical decreasing of plasma cholesterol level [150]. However, studies on this topic are needed to 
confirm these hypotheses. Moreover, human are still few, and generally conducted on a restricted 
number of subjects. Therefore, further larger randomized studies controlled for potential confounders, 
such as sex, age, race, nutritional status and dietary habits in human are required before using the 
leaves as hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic herbal drug. 
7.5. Hepato and Kidney Protective Properties 
Controversial results about the effects of Moringa oleifera leaves on liver and kidney health are 
reported. Oyagbemi et al. [157] and Asiedu-Gyekye et al. [129] observed an increment in serum 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood 
urea nitrose (BUN) and creatinine following an administration of the extract of Moringa oleifera 
leaves in mice. Being biomarkers of liver and kidney injury, the authors speculated that leaves might 
predispose to hepatic and kidney damage. However, histopathological examinations did not reveal any 
histological lesions in the sinusoids or central vein [129]. On the other hand, other studies [158–161] 
reported hepatic and kidney protective properties against several drugs, such as isoniazid, rifampicin, 
pyrazinamide, acetaminophen and gentamicin, attributable to Moringa oleifera leaves. The authors 
observed a reduction of serum ALT, AST, ALP [158–160] and BUN and creatinine [161] in animals 
treated with the extract of Moringa oleifera leaves. These findings were confirmed by histological 
examinations, which revealed an amelioration of the hepatic and kidney damages induced by drugs, in 
animals treated with Moringa oleifera leaves. Similar results were obtained by Adeyemi and  
Elebiyo [162] in rats co-treated with Moringa oleifera leaves and NiSO4 in order to induce 
nephrotoxicity. Finally, Das et al. [123] observed a reduction of ALT, AST and ALP and a lower liver 
damage in rats fed with high fat diet and co-treated with Moringa oleifera leaves, suggesting a 
potential role of the leaves in the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
In conclusion, scientific evidences suggest a potential role of Moringa oleifera leaves in the 
amelioration of the hepatic and kidney damages induced by drugs in animals. However, further studies 
on human beings are required before using Moringa as herbal medication. 
7.6. Anticancer Properties 
Experimental evidences showed the capacity of Moringa oleifera leaves to protect organism and 
cell from oxidative DNA damage associated with cancer and degenerative diseases [163,164]. 
Many in Vitro studies evaluated the anticancer properties of both water and alcoholic extracts of 
Moringa oleifera leaves on different types of tumor cells lines. Sreelatha et al. [165] found that the 
aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation 
of KB human tumor (KB) cells line. This antiproliferative effect was also associated with an induction 
of apoptosis, morphological changes and DNA fragmentation. Tiloke et al. [166] observed a 
significant increment in reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a concomitant decrease in intracellular 
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 12823 
 
 
GSH levels caused by a reduction in Nrf2 protein (1.89-fold) and mRNA expression (1.44-fold) in 
human lung cancer cells treated with Moringa oleifera leaves extract compared to untreated cells. 
These oxidants can react with DNA in the cell determining a DNA fragmentation with consequent 
death of cell itself. The pro-apoptotic properties of Moringa oleifera leaves extract were also 
confirmed by the significant increase in p53 protein (1.02-fold) and mRNA expression (1.59-fold),  
in caspase-9 (1.28-fold) and caspase-3/7 (1.52-fold) activities and an enhanced expression of 
Smac/DIABLO in cells treated with the extract. Moringa oleifera leaves extract also caused the 
cleavage and activation of PARP-1 into 89 and 24 KDa fragments [166]. The apoptosis induction and 
tumor cell growth inhibition activities of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves on human lung 
cancer cells were also studied by Jung [167]. This study confirmed previous results and found that 
Moringa oleifera leaves extract showed greater cytotoxicity for tumor cells than for normal cells, 
strongly suggesting that it could be an ideal anticancer therapeutic candidate specific to cancer cells.  
In the study of Berkovich et al. [168], concentration ≥0.75 mg/mL of Moringa oleifera leaves  
extract determined a significant inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1) survival as a result  
of progressive cell apoptosis. In particular, the treatment with 2 mg/mL Moringa oleifera leaves 
extract resulted in a reduction of 98% of Panc-1 cells survival, attributable, at least in part, by  
a down-regulation of the expression of key NF-κB signaling pathway proteins. Parvathy and 
Umamaheshwari [169] found that methanolic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves exhibited less viability 
on myeloma cells both at highest dose (2% at 200 μg/mL) and at lowest dose (12% at 0.5 μg/mL). 
Khalafalla et al. [170] found that both hot water and ethanolic Moringa oleifera leaves extracts 
inhibited the viability of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells. On the other hand, all the tested extracts did not exhibit toxic effects against  
normal mononuclear cells. Charoensin [171] found that dichloromethane extract of Moringa oleifera 
leaves was more cytotoxic against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2; IC50 = 120.37 µg/mL), 
colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2; IC50 = 112.46 µg/mL) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7;  
IC50 = 133.58 µg/mL) than methanolic extract (IC50 > 250 µg/mL). Both extracts had no toxicity on 
human fibroblast. Finally, Pamok et al. [172] observed that both aqueous and ethanolic extract 
inhibited cell proliferation of three different types of colon cancer cells lines, with better results using 
ethanolic extract. 
Only one in vivo study is available in literature about anticancer properties of the extract of  
Moringa oleifera leaves. Purwal et al. [173] studied the effects of oral administration of hydromethanolic 
and methanolic extracts of Moringa oleifera leaves in murine melanoma tumor model. The authors 
observed that an oral administration of 500 mg/kg for 15 days of the extracts determined a delay in  
the growth of tumors and a significant increase of life span of 48% and 32% for methanolic and 
hydrometanolic extracts respectively. 
In conclusion, in vitro studies suggest potential anti-cancer properties of Moringa oleifera leaves. These 
properties may be explained by the presence of several bioactive compounds, such as 4-(α-L-rhamnosyloxy) 
benzyl isothiocyanate, niazimicin and β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside [174,175]. However, 
further animal studies are needed to confirm these effects. Finally, no studies on human are available 
in literature.

8. Conclusions 
Moringa oleifera is one of the most studied and used plants. Its uses stretch from food and 
medicinal uses to water purification, biopesticide and production of biodiesel. 
Moringa shows diversifications in many features and high morphological variability which may 
become a resource for the conservation and the selection of Moringa oleifera germplasm. However, 
some questions still have to be addressed, i.e., collection and characterization of world accessions 
(both cultivated and natural) and setting a collaborative network among all institutions that already 
work on Moringa oleifera. This will help scientists and producers to have reliable access to 
information and materials and better develop Moringa. Moreover, researches focused on the 
association between phenotypical and molecular data and on genetic maps (both association map and 
physical map) in order to identify genes are needed within the contest of breeding. Next generation 
sequencing (NGS) could be an approachable tool to discover genome-wide genetic markers and 
building saturated genetic map within reasonable cost and time. 
Nevertheless Moringa oleifera is an interesting plant for its contribution in bioactive compounds.  
In particular, leaves, the most used part of the plant, are rich in vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenol, 
phenolic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, tannins and saponins.  
In addition, even if leaves present high variation in the amounts of bioactive compounds as a result of 
the genetic characteristics of the plant, the environmental conditions to which the plant is subjected 
and the post-harvest treatments as well, they present greater amounts of these compounds than fruits, 
vegetables and other plants generally used in human nutrition. On the other hand, the high leaves 
content of oxalates and phytates could limit the intestinal adsorption of minerals. Therefore, this  
aspect should be taken in to account for future nutritional researches focused on using Moringa as 
minerals supplementation. 
The high contribution in bioactive compounds may explain the pharmacological properties  
ascribed to Moringa oleifera leaves. Many in vitro and in vivo studies in animals have widely 
confirmed numerous pharmacological properties. However, few evidences on human beings are 
available. Therefore, it is too early to recommend Moringa oleifera leaves as medication in the 
prevention or treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, cancer and infective 
diseases. Further studies aimed to confirm the pharmacological effects of moringa on human beings 
and, at the same time, ensuring its safety on human health consequently to a chronic or long-term use 
should be encouraged.
