Further experimental studies on Rhynchosia members may be result new and novel secondary metabo-lites with potent biological activities.Abstract Traditionally, medicinal plants have played a significant role on human life since ancient days. At present, natu-ral compounds are the major source for the modern drug discovery owing to their therapeutic selectivity, minutest of side effects, inexpensive source and serve as lead molecules for the discovery of new drugs. Rhynchosia species (Fabaceae) are extensively circulated throughout the tropical and subtropical areas around the world. A few plants of this genus were used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments such as antibacterial, antidiabetic, abortifacients, healing of wounds, hepatoprotective, remedial of boils, rheumatic pains and skin infections. The present review compiles traditional uses, isolated chemical compounds and pharmacological activities of Rhynchosia species. So far, in total, seventy-seven compounds were isolated from the genus Rhynchosia, including flavonoids, isoflavonoids, flavan-3-ols, xanthones, biphenyls, simple polyphenols and sterols. It is interesting to note that the genus Rhynchosia is a rich source of C-glycosylflavonoids and prenylated isoflavonoids. Further, phytochemical and pharmacological studies on this genus are required since only few species have been investigated so far.Keywords Flavonoids · Phytochemistry · Pharmacology · Rhynchosia · Traditional medicineIntroductionMedicinal plants are worthy source of biologically active compounds for the development of new therapeutic drug candidates over the past centuries (Harvey 2008; Koehn and Carter 2005; Newman and Cragg 2012). Plants are treasure house of bioactive compounds which can be developed as safe drugs for the treatment of various human diseases. It is the time to recall the significance and past invention of some of the most illustrative examples of successful and promising drugs from natural source are listed. Aspirin: an anti-inflammatory agent (Newman et al. 2000); Digitoxin: used as a drug for congestive heart failure (Buss et al. 2003); Morphine: is a commercial drug and its derivative apomor-phine used to treat Parkinson′s disease (Dias et al. 2012); Penicillin: an important antibacterial agent (Wainwright 1990), Quinine: the anti-malarial drug (Achan et al. 2011); Taxol: promising anticancer drug (Kingston 1993), etc. are  * Aluru Rammohan  RAluru@urfu.ru; rammohan4ever@gmail.com1 Department of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, Ural Federal University, Chemical Engineering Institute, 19 Mira St, Yekaterinburg 620002, Russian Federation2 Natural Products Division, Department of Chemistry, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, India3 Department of Pathophysiology, The Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou 515031, Guangdong Province, China4 Ural Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, I.

Even today, people in several countries are extensively using plant species as a remedy for the treatment of various kinds of diseases such as bacterial infections, cardiovascular, diabetic, digestive, kidney, mental-nervous, nutritional, respiratory, reproduc-tive, sensory, skin infections and several wounds (González-Tejero et al. 2008). Thus, the plants have valuable source of natural compounds and played significant role in the cur-rent drug discovery with clinically enriched efficacy besides fewer side effects (Butler 2004). Hence, many researchers have been focusing their research interest on medicinal plants in terms of biological activity and drug discovery.Among the plants of Fabaceae family which are used in traditional medicine, Rhynchosia species have occupied a prominent role. Rhynchosia genus consists of approximately 300 species circulated throughout the tropical and subtropi-cal areas around the world, out of which twenty-two spe-cies occur in India (Chadha 1976; Willis 1966). The species belonging to the genus Rhynchosia (Fabaceae) are herbs, twining or erect shrubs. Previous phytochemical investiga-tions on several species of Rhynchosia showed that the genus is exclusive to profuse production of C-glycosylflavonoids (Rao et al. 1991). Some of the isolated compounds of Rhyn-chosia genus and their plant extracts exhibit interesting bio-logical activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimycobacterial and antiproliferative (Coronado-Aceves et al. 2017; Kinjo et al. 2001; Rondo 2017). A tiny review on chemical constituents of Rhynchosia genus was published in 1991 from our laboratory (Rao et al. 1991); however, the review covers only few phytochemistry reports but not on pharmacology perspective. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive, updated phytochemical and pharmacology review was published on Rhynchosia species which cov-ers the literature up to date. The present review aimed to deliver an outline on the traditional uses, chemical constitu-ents and pharmacology activities of the genus Rhynchosia which includes the literature up to date for future research opportunities.Traditional usesBased on folkloric medications, a few plants of Rhynchosia genus were used in indigenous medicine (Bakshu and Raju 2001; Bangalore and Agrahari 2009; Gamble and Fischer 1935; Kritikar and Basu 1975) such as antibacterial, anti-diabetic, abortifacients, healing of wounds, hepatoprotec-tive, rheumatic pains, remedial for boils and skin infections by Adivasi tribes. For example, Rhynchosia scarabaeiods L. (known as ‘gadi chikkudu kaya’) has been used to treat various bacterial diseases like dysentery, diarrhea and skin infections (Challa et al. 2011). Another endemic species of South India, Rhynchosia suaveolens DC is reported as antioxidant and antibacterial agent (Khan and Shoeb 1984; Rammohan et al. 2015). The whole plant of Rhynchosia pseudo-cajan Cambess is widely distributed in Pakistan and is used to treat oxidative stress through antioxidant princi-ples (Riaz et al. 2011). Roots of some species of Rhynchosia genus have bacterial nodules which enrich soil and may be useful for the agricultural practices (Chadha 1976). Seeds of some Rhynchosia members are said to have bitter and toxic drug properties but occasionally consumed by certain South Mexican Indian tribes as analgesics (Allen and Allen 1981). The species Rhynchosia volubilis has been reported as property of antiproliferative (Kinjo et al. 2001) and Rhyn-chosia villosa showed tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory activity (Rondo 2017). In addition, R. volubilis is used by Koreans as local cosmetics which has a property of depigmenting the skin stains, treating the skin wrinkles and anti-aging (Li and Xiang 2011). Likewise, the leaves of Rhynchosia beddomei were found to be antidiabetic (Mary et al. 2014), Rhynchosia precatoria roots exhibits antimycobacterial activity (Coronado-Aceves et al. 2017) and the Rhynchosia pyramidalis has androgenic and aphrodisiac action (Farns-worth et al. 1967). The essential oil isolated from the leaves of Rhynchosia heynei and Rhynchosia minima showed broad spectrum of antimicrobial (Bakshu and Raju 2009; Gweru et al. 2009), antioxidant activities (Gweru et al. 2009) and allelopathy activity (Abd ElGawad et al. 2018). Therefore, the development of drug agents from natural origin is of great importance, based on the traditional and pharmaco-logical uses of the genus Rhynchosia.Table 6 represents the reported traditional uses of Rhyn-chosia species used for treating various ailments. These documented data represent that most of the species are used to treat oxidative stress-related (antioxidants), antibacterial, anti-inflammation and skin disorders. Also, they are used as analgesic and for the digestive disorders.PhytochemistryIn the past few decades, some Rhynchosia species have been investigated from a phytochemical and pharmacologi-cal point of view. So far, in total, seventy-seven compounds were isolated; their structures, names and the correspond-ing plant source are compiled in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A comprehensive of chemical constituents so far reported from the genus Rhynchosia can be conveniently grouped into the following types.Flavones and flavone glycosidesFifteen compounds (1–15, Fig. 1) were isolated from the genus Rhynchosia so far. Among them, most of the reported C-glycosylflavones are derivatives of apigenin and luteolin.Planta (2020) 251:9 1 3Page 3 of 15 9Table 1  Naturally occurring flavones and flavone glycosides of the genus Rhynchosia Compounds/trivial names Plant source Plant part ReferencesApigenin (1) R. beddomei Leaves Adinarayana et al.

Except compound 23, all the flavonols and flavonol glycosides reported in the genus Rhynchosia are the derivatives of kaempferol and querce-tin. An interesting note that Rhynchosin (23), is the only 5-deoxyflavnol is isolated from the leaves of Rhynchosia beddomei (Adinarayana et al. 1980c) up to now in the genus Rhynchosia.FlavanonesNaringenin (25) and lupinifolin (26) were isolated from the leaves of Rhynchosia beddomei and the roots of Rhyn-chosia precatoria, respectively (Adinarayana et al. 1979; Coronado-Aceves et al. 2017), which are the only two fla-vanones so far reported in this genus (Fig. 3).Table 3  Naturally occurring dihydroflavonols of the genus Rhynchosia Compounds/Trivial Names Plant Source Plant part ReferencesTirumalin (27) R. cyanosperma Leaves Adinarayana et al.

Also, the compounds 27–29 were reported as new dihyroflavols from the species R. cyano-sperma (Adinarayana et al. 1980a; Rao and Gunasekar 1988) and R. densiflora (Rao and Gunasekar 1998).Isoflavones and IsoflavanonesA total of nineteen isoflavones (31–49, Fig. 5) and three isoflavanones (50–53) to date were reported from the genus Rhynchosia. Most of the isoflavones isolated from the species R. edulis (Ogungbe et al. 2011) are substituted with either prenyl or dimethylpyrano group in both ring A and ring B, except in 46 and 47 in which prenylation in ring B is absent. Two isoflavone derivatives, rhynedulinal (46) and candelinal (47) are isolated from R. edulis which have an unusual formyl group at 3′-position. Furthermore, two new isoflavanones reported as precatorin A (50) and B (51) from the roots of R. precatoria (Coronado-Aceves et al. 2017) are structural isomers, as they differed only in the location of dimethylpyrene ring fusion in an ring A of isoflavanoid moiety. An unusual method was attempted using 1-butyl-3-methyl tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid for the isolation of isoflavones such as biochanin A (34), 4′-(1′′-methoxy)-propoylgenistein (40) and cajanone (48) from the Rhynchosia volubilis (Ogungbe et al. 2011) and this report was very typical compared with conventional methods. This approach for the extraction and isolation of flavonoids using ionic liquids is environmental benign and green method. An unusual new isoflavanoid derivative, Rhynchoviscin (53) reported from R. viscosa with novel skeleton basis of benzodihydrofuran moiety fused with benzodihydropyran ring, was established with 2D NMR spectral studies. The isolation of compound 53 is achieved through Zebrafish bioassay-guided microfractionation (Bohni et al. 2013) and this report is unique in this genus.Flavan‑3‑olsCatechin (54) (Rondo 2017), epicatechin (55) (Li and Xiang 2011), 7-O-galloylcatechin (56) (Kinjo et al. 2001) and proanthocyanidin (57) (Rangaswamy et al. 1974), are the four flavan-3-ols (Fig. 6) so far isolated from various Rhynchosia species.Other phenolic compoundsThese are non-flavonoid class simple polyphenolic com-pounds and listed below.XanthonesBesides the above revealed flavonoids, two xanthone-C-glycosides (Fig. 7), mangiferin (58) and isomangiferin (59) (Adinarayana and Chetty 1985; Rammohan et  al. 2015) have been isolated from R. suaveolens. It is expected that the co-occurrence C-glycosylflavonoids and C-glyco-sylxanthones in the same source R. suaveolens is due to chemotaxonomic prominence.Table 5  Naturally occurring simple phenolic compounds of the genus Rhynchosia Compounds/trivial names Plant source Plant part ReferencesProtocatechuic acid (62) R. minima Pericaps Krishnamurty et al.

The existence of biphenyls in plants was believed that the aldol-type condensation of shikimate derived β-triketo ester.Simple polyphenolsTwelve simple polyphenolic compounds (62–73, Fig. 8) such as gallic acid (63), vanillic acid (64) and gallic acid derivatives (65–69) so far reported from the genus Rhynchosia. Moreover, two polyhydric alcohols such as d-pinitol and d-inositol were also isolated from the leaves of R. beddomei (Adinarayana et al. 1979 and Adinarayana et al. 1980c). A unique trioxygenated simple benzophe-none (70) was reported as a new chemical constituent from the flowers of R. suaveolens (Rammohan et al. 2015).Sterolsβ-Sitosterol (74), Stigmasteryl galactoside (75), Lupeol (76) and ergosterol peroxide (77) are the four steroid compounds isolated from the whole plant of R. minima so far reported in Rhynchosia genus (Ahmed et al. 1992; Krishnamurty et al. 1975, Fig. 9).Fig. 2  Flavanol and flavonol glycosides (16–24) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia Fig. 3  Flavanones (25–26) isolated from the genus Rhyn-chosia Fig. 4  Dihydroflavonols (27–30) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia Planta (2020) 251:9 1 3Page 9 of 15 9Fig. 5  Isoflavones (31–50) and Isoflavanones (51–53) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia  Planta (2020) 251:91 39 Page 10 of 15PharmacologyMost of the reports are either isolation of chemical constit-uents or preliminary pharmacological screening of plant extracts of Rhynchosia species. There are very few reports are on the bioassay guided isolation of natural compounds and their biological activity studies. In the above section, under traditional uses, we have summarized the activity studies of plant extracts of Rhynchosia members and in the current section, the study focusing mostly on stated biological activities of isolated compounds of Rhyncho-sia members. Most of the reported activities are anti-bacterial, allelopathic activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-inflammatory activity, antimycobacterial, antioxidant, antiproliferative, antityrosinase and cytotoxic activity.Antioxidant studiesThe reactive oxygen species termed as free radicals are formed in human tissue cells during metabolic process, which cause general oxidative damage leading to cellular damage, several types of cancers, inflammation, hyperten-sion and age related diseases. Therefore, many researchers have focused on natural antioxidants because they serve as primary ingredients to balance the oxidative dam-age against free radicals. Flavonoids are the hugest group of secondary metabolite occuring in plants which show Fig. 6  Flavan-3-ols (54–57) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia Fig. 7  Xanthones (58–59) and biphenyls (60–61) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia Planta (2020) 251:9 1 3Page 11 of 15 9wide range of therapeutic applications including antioxi-dant activities. The bioassay-guided isolation of flowers of Rhynchosia suaveloens resulted in four flavonoids, isovi-texin (8), isoorientin (14), mangiferin (58) and 2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzophenone (70), which were tested for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (Rammohan et al. 2015). Among them, compounds 58 and 14 showed prominent antioxidant activity with  IC50 51.7 and 57.7 µg/mL, respectively, comparably with positive control ascorbic acid  (IC50 34.2 µg/mL). In another study, the aerial parts of Rhynchosia capitata were studied through DPPH and nitric oxide antioxidant principles (Praveena et al. 2013) which resulted in five C-glycosylflavanoids namely, vitexin (7), isovitexin (8), vicenin 2 (10), orientin (13) and isoorientin (14). The C-glycosyl flavonoids were studied through density functional theory (DFT) to understand the molecular properties, factors and mechanism of radical scav-enging ability. This study declares that the antioxidant activ-ity of C-glycosyl flavonoids was exhibited by donating the electrons instead of seizing the free radicals. As a result, this report concludes that the compound vitexin (7) acts as good radical scavenger based on quantum chemical computation and theoretical analysis.Antimicrobial activityRecently, four flavonoids namely, isovitexin (8), isoorien-tin (14), quercetin-7-O-methylether (21) and biochanin A (34) were isolated from the flowers of Rhynchosia beddomei (Rammohan et al. 2019). All the compounds were tested for their antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi using disc diffusion method. Isoorientin (14) and quercetin-7-O-methylether (21) showed potent inhibition concentrations 20.1 and 15.8 nm; and 20.4 and 15.7 nm, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Further, the in silico and Lipinski’s rule analysis of the isolated compounds concluded that the compounds 14 and 21 act as prominent antimicrobial agents.Fig. 8  Simple polyphenols (62–73) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia  Planta (2020) 251:91 39 Page 12 of 15Antimycobacterial activityThe roots of Rhynchosia precatoria DC was tested for in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activity against Myco-bacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis with redox indicator Alamar Blue (Coronado-Aceves et al. 2017). Further, isolation of dichloromethane fraction of roots of Rhynchosia precatoria resulted in six flavonoids, lupinifolin (26), lupinifolinol (30), cajanone (48), precatorin C (49), precatorin A (51) and precatorin B (52). All the isolated compounds, except compound 30, were screened for anti-mycobacterial activity. The compounds lupinifolin (26) and cajanone (48) exhibited highest activity against Mycobac-terium tuberculosis (Mtb) with MIC 31.25 and 62.5 µg/mL, respectively. While, the compounds precatorin A (51) and cajanone (48) showed potent activity Mycobacterium smeg-matis (Msm) with MIC 125 µg/mL (297.29 µM) and 125 µg/mL (295.87 µM), respectively.Anti‑inflammatory and anti‑angiogenic activitiesRecent report on the Zebrafish integrated microfractionation of Rhynchosia viscosa resulted in five flavonoid compounds such as genistein (33), 3′-O-methylorobol (36), licoisofla-vone A (39), sophoraisoflavone A (50) and a novel new compound, Rhynchoviscin (53) (Bohni et al. 2013). Fur-ther, the isolated compounds were tested for anti-inflam-matory activity using LPS-enhanced leukocyte migration assay. Genistein (33) and sophoraisoflavone A (50) showed significant inhibition of leukocyte migration with  IC50 12.5 and 25 µM, respectively. The other two compounds 36 and 39, did not show any significant inhibition. Further, the angi-ogenic activity of extracts and compounds was also carried out using Zebrafish-based vascular outgrowth assay. The compounds, genistein (33) and licoisoflavone A (39) showed good potency of anti-angiogenic activity with  IC50 24.2 and 16.7 µM, respectively (Bohni et al. 2013).Antityrosinase activityThe bioassay-guided isolation of roots of Rhynchosia villosa resulted in five compounds viz., genistein (33), 2′-hydroxygenistein (35), cajanin (38), catechin (54) and 7-O-galloylcatechin (56). Besides, the isolated compounds exhibited prominent tyrosinase activities (Bohni et al. 2013) such as genistein (31.45 µM), catechin (36.86 µM), cajanin (38.97 µM), galloylcatechin (60.40 µM) and 2′-hydroxygen-istein (69.49 µM). The compounds 33 and 38 exhibited the highest tyrosinase inhibitory activity, which may be used as depigmenting agent to treat hyperpigmentation (Bohni et al. 2013).Cytotoxic activityThe phytochemical analysis of roots of Rhynchosia preca-toria DC yielded six compounds such as lupinifolin (26), lupinifolinol (30), cajanone (48), precatorin C (50), preca-torin A (51) and precatorin B (52). Further, the roots and Fig. 9  Sterols (74–77) isolated from the genus Rhynchosia Planta (2020) 251:9 1 3Page 13 of 15 9isolated compounds (except lupinifolinol) of Rhynchosia precatoria were screened for cytotoxic activity against murine macrophages cells (RAW 264.7) using MTT reduc-tion assay (Coronado-Aceves et al. 2017). The  IC50 values of the isolated compounds from 13.73 to 160.52 µM indi-cate that these compounds exhibit less prominent activities and may not be appropriate to treat disease cancer but they may serve as lead molecules for the development of new synthetic molecules.Antibacterial activityThe antibacterial activity of ethanol extract of whole plant of Rhynchosia suaveloens was studied against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus pathogens (Khan and Shoeb 1984). The active fraction further purification yields two biphenyls, 4-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-5-methoxy-(1,1′-biphenyl)-3-ol (60) and 2-carboxy-4-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-5-methoxy-(1,1′-biphenyl)-3-ol (61). These both biphenyls also showed activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphy-lococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 15.63 and 31.25 µg/mL, respectively.Antiproliferative activityThe antiproliferative properties of seeds of Rhynchosia vol-ubilis were tested against human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (MK-1), human uterus carcinoma (HeLa) and murine melanoma (B16F10) using MTT assay (Kinjo et al. 2001). The MeOH extract showed potent growth inhibition of MK-1  (GI50: 25 µg/ml), HeLa  (GI50: 30 µg/ml) and B16F10 cells  (GI50: 8 µg/ml). Further, bioassay-guided isolation of MeOH extract results in six polyphenols, 7-O-galloylcate-chin (56), gallic acid (63), methyl gallate (66), glucogallin (67), 1,6-di-O-galloylglucose (68) and trigalloylgallic acid (69) which showed good inhibition against B16F10 than HeLa and MK-1 cells. Among all the isolates, trigalloylgal-lic acid showed the highest activity with B16F10, HeLa and MK-1 cells  (GI50: 2.9, 9.3 and 10 µg/ml) followed by the gallic acid  (GI50: 7.1, 22 and 19 µg/ml). From the results and structure–antiproliferative activity studies of gallic acid derivatives, it is concluded that the number of galloyl groups and either presence/absence of three adjacent free hydroxyl groups or free carboxyl group for polyphenols are not the prominent reason for weak inhibition of cancer cells by other gallic acid derivatives (56, 66–68).Allelopathic activityThe essential oil isolated from the roots of Rhynchosia minima L. consists of majorly volatile compounds such as α-eudesmol, trans-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, 2-allyl-5-tert-butylhydroquinone and τ -cadinol (Abd ElGawad et al. 2018). This essential oil showed significant inhibition of D. aegyptium and R. dentatus germination. Hence, it is recommended as green bio-herbicides such as allelochemicals.ConclusionsThough approximately 300 Rhynchosia species are distrib-uted all over the world, only 22 species, R. bracteata, R. bed-domei, R. cana, R. capitate, R. cyanosperma, R. densiflora, R. edulis, R. heynei, R. jacobii, R. minima, R. precatoria, R. pyramidalis, R. pseudo-cajan, R. rothii, R. rufescens, R. sericea, R. suaveolens, R. sublobata, R. scarabaeoides, R. villosa, R. viscosa and R. volubilis, have been investigated so far. Phytochemical studies on the species of this genus led to the isolation of 77 compounds including flavonoids, iso-flavonoids, flavan-3-ols, xanthones, biphenyls, simple poly-phenols and sterols. Literature survey demonstrated that the genus Rhynchosia is a rich source of C-glycosylflavonoids and prenylated isoflavonoids. From the published reports on the phytochemical and pharmacological perspective, the genus Rhynchosia is a potent source of novel bioactive com-pounds such as rhynchoviscin, cajanone, genistein, mangif-erin, vitexin, precatorin A. The authors of this review believe that insufficient work has been done on this genus and hence, the further work on Rhynchosia species may result in novel natural compounds with potent biological activities. There-fore, this review may give a bird view for the future experi-mental studies in the discovery of new drugs.Author contribution statement The authors AR and DG were outline and collected the literature associated to the review.
