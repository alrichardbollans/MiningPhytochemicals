FTIR spectroscopy of powdered material of plant parts, rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers showed the presence of three main chemical groups, i.e. -OH (alcohol), -C=O (carbonyl) and -CO-O-CO (anhydride). The phytochemical composition of n-Hexane, chloroform and ethanol crude extracts of same parts analysed by GC-MS and n-Hexane extract of various parts indicated 14 compounds with highest (10) in flowers extract followed by six compounds in chloroform and five in ethanol extracts of plant parts. The antibacterial activity was assessed against Salmonella enterica, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus by using well diffusion method and similar resistance was shown by n-Hexane and ethanol extracts while noticeable inhibition by chloroform extract, especially by leaves showing zone of inhibition, 16.17±0.52mm, comparable with Gentamycin 18±0.11mm. The antioxidant activity in terms of DPPH Scavenging activity was found higher in n-Hexane and chloroform extracts, especially leaves i.e., 54.6±0.43 & 43.45±0.53 as compared to that of ethanol extracts. The percentage activity was increased with an increase of concentration of extracts. Antiproliferative activity checked by SRB proliferative assay and the crude extracts of plant parts of C. difformis showed good activity against A2780 and HCT116 cancer cells in three days. C. difformis having therapeutic action as well as its’ ethnopharmacological history, being used as fodder, it may be recommended good herbal fodder for the dairy animals.

Plants are a major source of drugs. The medicinal properties of plants are associated with the variety of phytochemicals, synthesized as a result of metabolic activities in them, such as flavonoids, steroids, alkaloids, tannins, lactones, sesquiterpene, coumarins, triterpenes, carbohydrates, etc. These compounds demonstrate diverse biological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anticonvulsants, anti-AcademicPresNotulae Botanicae HortiCluj-NapocaAgrobotaniciAhmad SZ et al.

Worlds Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 80% of the world’s population is mainly dependent upon herbal remedies for the treatment of the diseases (Ganesan et al., 2004). Phytochemicals or secondary metabolites are very important in changing the physiological processes of human body. The demand of ethnomedicinally important plants is increasing day by day (Kumar et al., 2015).  Herbal medicines are playing important role in modern health care system due to their cost effectiveness and low side effects. Plants are major source of new drugs discovery (Dar et al., 2017). Anticancerous and antioxidant potential of different plant species were determined globally, Selamoglu et al. (2017a) determined the in vitro antioxidant potential of five different plant species i.e., Plantago lanceolata, P. major, Robinia pseudoacacia, Platanus arientakis and P. aesculus. Selamoglu (2017b) emphasized the importance of polyphenolic compound such as flavonoids present in various plant food products and medicines in reducing the risk of serious health problems, these compounds are frequently occurring in the plants and about 6,000 flavonoids have been identified.  Erdemli et al. (2017) conducted an experiment on the biochemical efficacy of grape seed extract coupled with low laser therapy in intraoral wound healing effect in rat liver. The active compound, catchin was found present in grape seed. Erdemli (2018) studied the role of grape seed extract and low laser therapy on the healing of fractured mandible of rats. The biochemical agent in the extract showed very promising effects.  Nageen et al. (2018) revealed a research work on Eupatilin, a biologically active flavone reported from many medicinal plants that it is an excellent anticancer agent having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential. The derivatives of this compounds can enhance its efficacy to reduce the toxicity of drugs. Akalin and Selamoglu (2019) explained the importance of natural foods in maintenance of healthy skin, due to their pharmacological, antioxidant and antibiotic activities reducing cellular damage and stress and age-related disorders in skin health. Jiang et al. (2019) conducted a research to determine the pharmacological and biological potential of formononetin, a bioactive isoflavon extracted from different plants mainly from Glycine max, Trifolium pretense and Astragalus membranaceus. It was observed that Formononetin has anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, especially cancer-causing pathways and arresting cell cycle. Salehi et al. (2019) determined the phytochemical, phytotherapy and pharmaceutical properties of different juices of leaves and fruits of the genus Berberis. It consists of several bioactive compounds which are used for the treatment of several diseases. Several oils including p-cymene, ocimene and limonene were reported in the juices by the gas chromatography. It was also observed that plants of this genus have antimicrobial and anticancer activities.  Nawaz et al. (2020) studied the role of Cardamonin, chalconoid role in human wellbeing. It was found that chalcone has great role in anticancer activity in boosting immune system, killing various pathogens, through the modulation of cell pathways. Khan et al. (2021) studied that lycopene, an antioxidant acquired importance in preventing autoxidation of fats and related products. Tomatoes are an important agricultural product for the source of lycopene. It was observed that the lycopene taken in the diet showed positive effects in many stages of atherosclerosis. The serum lipid levels, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, blood pressure, and antioxidative potential are mainly affected by lycopene. Ozdemir et al. (2021) conducts an experiment to investigate the antioxidant potential of caffeic acid phenethy ester, propolis and pollens on heart of rats, as they hypothesized that heart and vessels are affected by the high blood pressure. It was observed that BP of rats treated with pollens, CAPE and propolis were significantly reduced at 0.05 significance level, thus, found having vasorelaxant properties. Adnan et al. (2021) studied pharmacologically active compounds physcion and physcion 8-O-B-D-glycopyranoside (PG) and anthraquinones which showed excellent potential against cancerous activities. It was concluded on the basis of reviewed literature that PG and physcion regulated multitudinous cell mechanism of actions and regulating multitudinous cell signaling pathways, cell cycle, kinase Ahmad SZ et al.

The weeds, growing nearby our houses, on agricultural and waste or farm lands are very good source of herbal medicine. Some important medicinal weed sedges belonging to family Cyperaceae, are found growing mostly in wet, damp places and rest in dry places. Family Cyperaceae having more than 4000 species of 70 genera are mostly traditionally used as medicine, due to a large number of bioactive compounds in them such as, caryophyllene oxide, cyperotundone, germacrene D, α-cyperone, α-corymbolol, α-pinene, mustakone and zierone, which enhance the impact of these species as therapeutic plants. The crude extracts of Cyperus sp. exhibit antidepressive, antiarthritic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, neuroprotective, antiobesity, vasodilator, spasmolytic, bronchodilator, and estrogenic properties (Yasman et al., 2021). In the present research work the phytochemical screening of Cyperus difformis L. was carried out through the FTIR analysis to elaborate the functional groups of the chemical compounds and GCMS for the identification of chemical compounds, and also its ethnopharmacological potential, in terms of the antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activities was evaluated using standard techniques.  Cyperus difformis L. commonly known as small-flowered nut sedge or rice sedge, is an annual weed with fibrous roots of predominately red colour and stem is erect, triangular 2-3mm in thickness, basal leaves 3-4 in number, united at base with sheaths about 15-45 cm long. It is considered as annual weed with fibrous roots of predominately red colour, having length of 100 cm (Lanidon et al., 2011).   Materials and Methods  Plant collection Cyperus difformis was collected from tehsil and district Narowal, Punjab, identified using Flora of Pakistan (Kukkenon, 2001) and its’ voucher specimen was deposited in Botanical herbarium, GC university, Lahore.  The plant parts, i.e., rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers were separated, dried in shade at room temperature and ground into fine powder.   Preparation of plants extracts The n-hexane, chloroform and ethanol were used to get the crude extracts of powder of different plant parts using maceration technique (Paliwal et al., 2017).  Phytochemical screening Identification of functional groups by FTIR Spectra The powder of different plant parts roots and rhizome, leaves and flowers were analysed by FTIR spectroscopy for the identification of functional groups (Pharmawati and Wrasiati, 2020).  GCMS analysis The chemical compounds in the targeted sedge weed were identified through GC-MS (Model GC-MS-QP2010, Shimadzu Co., Japan), with capillary column equipped with DB-1 column containing length (0.25 m film x 0.25mm ID x 30m length) having ionization volt 70 eV, at 230 °C injector temperature and 280 °C detector temperature, the carrier gas, helium (99.9% purity) flowing at the rate of 1 mL/min, initially oven temperature programmed at 80 oC (isothermal for 5min.), then increasing to 200 oC at 5 oC/min and finally to 280 oC at 5 oC/min (isothermal for 16min). The compounds found present in 1 L of the sample injected were identified using the available mass spectral records of NIST and WILEY libraries (Abo-Altemem et al., 2019).  Ahmad SZ et al. (2022). Not Bot Horti Agrobo 50(4):12918  4       Exploration of antibacterial potential The well diffusion susceptibility method was employed to test the antibacterial activity of the weed extracts against 18-24 hours old cultures of pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella enterica, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Four wells (8 mm in diameter) were made in each petri plate containing agar medium, using sterilized cork-borer. Each plant sample (24 μL) containing 4 mg of dried extract was poured into each well. A standard antibiotic, Gentamycin (4 mg per 24 μL) and blank solvents (each 24 μL per well) were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Inoculated plates were then incubated at 37 oC for 24 hrs. Three replicates of each sample extracts were used to record the average value of zone of inhibition (Adeniyi et al., 2014; Aneja and Joshi, 2009).  Evaluation of antioxidant potential using DPPH radical scavenging assay Antioxidant potential was assessed through DPPH Radical Scavenging activity. The plant extracts were serially diluted ranging from 0.5 µg/mL to 5 µg/mL. 0.1 mM solution of DPPH was prepared by adding 95% ethanol. The test solution was prepared by adding 0.4 mL of serial dilutions and 2.6 mL of DPPH solution in the test tubes. After 30 minutes, spectrophotometric absorbance was recorded at 517nm. The control was having the same quantity of DPPH solution but not the extract while using ascorbic acid (5 mg/mL) as reference (Kakarla et al., 2016). The following equation was used to find out the % Scavenging activity: Scavenging Activity (%) = [(Absorbance of the control – Absorbance of the test sample)/ Absorbance of the control] × 100    Anticancer potential Cell lines (A2780 and HCT 116 Cells), maintained in culture medium (DMEM or RPMI) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 Å~ Antibiotic-Antimycotic at 37 °C in humified incubators passaged with 5% CO2, for less than 6 months before replacement from early passage frozen stocks, were tested for their antiproliferative activity after treating with two dilutions, i.e. 0.5mg/mL and 1mg/mL of n-Hexane, chloroform and ethanol crude extracts of rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers of C. difformis for 72 hours in 96-well plates, using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Cells were then fixed with ice-cold TCA (3% final concentration) for 2 hours at 4 °C and stained with 0.06% SRB. The O.D. of SRB bound to the stained cells, being solubilized in 10 mM Tris with pH 10.5 was measured at 490 nm using microplate reader (BioTek) after Manzoor et al. (2018).   Results  Phytochemical analysis FTIR spectra The results of FTIR analysis indicated three main groups, i.e. -OH (alcohol), -C=O (carbonyl) and -CO-O-CO (anhydride) in all the powdered plant parts samples. The position of -OH stretching was found slightly varied in the samples, may be due to the variation of hydrogen bonding strength and steric hindrance within the molecules of samples. The values were ranging between 3280-3260 cm-1 (Figure 1). The stretching of alkane -C-H in samples showed better intensity of peaks indicating less steric hindrance among molecules. Broad peaks of -C=O (carbonyl, 1610-1590 cm-1) and -CO-O-CO (anhydride, 1028-1013 cm-1) were observed in all the samples indicating the complexity in molecular structure.     Ahmad SZ et al. (2022).

Not Bot Horti Agrobo 50(4):12918  14       Discussion  Despite the prevalence of Cyperus difformis traditional use in medicine, the chemical components responsible for its efficacy are poorly understood. The FTIR spectroscopy of powder of its’ three different parts i.e. rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers showed the presence of alcoholic, carbonyl and anhydride groups. FTIR spectroscopy is proved to be a reliable and sensitive method for detection of bio molecular composition.  GC-MS analysis of n-Hexane crude extracts of rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers exhibited the presence 14 compounds, while 6 in chloroform extracts and 5 in ethanol extracts. The chloroform extract of flowers was found containing no compound. These phytochemicals are responsible for various pharmacological actions like antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, hepato-protective, diuretic, anti-asthma etc. Babu and Savithramma (2014) reported the presence of glycosides, lignins, quinones, tannins and terpenoid in the crude extract of leaves of C. difformis. Glycoside are important in medicine because of their action on heart and are used in cardiac insufficiency (Balch and Balch, 2000).   Lignins are significant components in the global carbon cycle; the resistance of lignin to microbial degradation enhances its persistence in soils (Cambell and Sederoff, 1996). Quinones are known to act as mobile electron carriers within the lipid phase of the membrane in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains (Fato et al., 1996).  Selamoglu (2018) described oxidative stress as a process of all the time faced by our bodies in damaging of the natural oxidation process resulting in the toxic effects, such as arteriosclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, myocardial and Alzheimer's disease, etc. In this particular research, importance of the plant extracts was highlighted to combat the issue related to the oxidative stress. The main function of quinones is to prevent damage of the cell by free-radical formation (Barr et al., 1992).  Tannins as the main component of astringent used for treating intestinal disorders such as diarrhea and dysentery (Dharmananda, 2003). Tannins and tannic acid form a pellicle of coagulated protein over the lining of the alimentary tract. Terpenoids are famous for analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities.  Results of antibacterial activity of n-Hexane, chloroform, and ethanol extracts of rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers suggested that Salmonella enterica was the most susceptible strain followed by Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli.  Moreover, the leaves extracts were the most effective against bacteria and showed strong antibacterial activity.  Chloroform extract of leaves were highly antibacterial.  The most effective DPPH scavenging potential was shown by the n-Hexane, chloroform and ethanol extract of leaves compared to rhizome (with roots) and flowers at 5 µg/ml concentration while the highest activity was shown by n-hexane extract of leaves.  Results of antiproliferative activity suggested that n-Hexane extracts of rhizome (with roots), leaves and flowers inhibited the proliferation of A2780 cell lines better than chloroform and ethanol extracts of these parts. The highest inhibition was observed by the n-Hexane extract of rhizomes with roots. Moreover, the chloroform extracts of all the targeted parts of plant were most effective in inhibiting the HCT116 cell line proliferation compared to their n-Hexane and ethanol extracts. Selamoglu (2017c) elaborated various biotechnological approaches used in anticancer activity by flavonoids, large group of phenolic compounds derived from plants. Many plant extracts show antioxidant activity and can thus be used in food products and helpful for good health. The highest anticancer potential was observed in chloroform extract of leaves with cell viability 0.46% showing 99.5% inhibition.        Ahmad SZ et al. (2022). Not Bot Horti Agrobo 50(4):12918  15       Conclusions  The above mentioned ethnopharmacological studies showing the targeted sedge weed possessing medicinal value may represent new sources of pharmaceutical industries for stable, pharmacologically active secondary metabolites which can be used as healers in the field of medicine, that can be used for the treatment of many diseases including pathogenic disorders. However, further research is required to establish the in vivo actions and therapeutic index of this sedge with respect to the management of various pathogenic diseases to improve the health of livestock.
