Introduction Plants are significant to human being for his life. Plants are incessantly an ordinary source of medicine in the usage of traditional preparations. All plants phyla create official and illegal product of therapeutic significance. The antiquity of herbal medicine is as very old as human society. The treasure of India is stored in the huge natural flora, which has been advantage to mankind. India is almost herbarium of the planet1,2. Although the biologically active phytoconstituents of certain herbal drugs are unidentified, they are prescribed normally owing to their effectiveness, least side effects in clinical information and moderately very low costs3. Ornamental plants are grown for decorative purposes in gardens and scenery design projects, as house plants, for cut flowers and specimen exhibit. Ornamentals and flowers harvests are not only grown for the exhibit of aesthetic features, but also have nutritive and therapeutic properties. There has been rehabilitated interest in utilizing garden environments having therapeutic value, as therapeutic entities to improve the process of healing that occurs in healthcare environments. The use of plant complexes for pharmaceutical purpose has steadily increased in India, about 85% of individuals from urbanized countries use customary medicine, which involves compounds resulting from medicinal plants4. Flowering trees are now being browbeaten in the customary medicine and their curative potentials are well recognized. C. wightii with common names Indian bdellium tree, Gugal, Guggul, Guggulu, is a flowering plant belonging to family Burseraceae. The Guggul plant may be found from northern Africa to central Asia, but is most common in Northern India. It prefers arid and semi-arid climates and is tolerant of poor Bhardwaj et al                                                                                                     Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(4-s):613-621 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [614]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO soil. It is a shrub or small tree, reaching a maximum height of 3m, with thin papery bark. C. wightii produces a resinous sap known as gum Guggul. The extract of this gum, called gugulipid or guglipid, has been used in Ayuvedic medicine abundantly. C. wightii contains essential oil, resin, gum, and bitter compounds. The major chemical constituents of C. wightii   are Z- guggulsterone, E-guggulsterone, guggullignans I & II, gugglu tetrols; mukulol; allylcembrol; c-27 guggulusterols I, II, III; Z-guggulusterol; E-guggulusterol etc. These constituents are responsible for several pharmacological activities like anti-inflammatory, analgesic, cleaning of wound and healing due to its antibacterial action. C. wightii is a natural health product used primarily to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels. It has been used for many years as a hypocholesterolaemic agent in India. C. wightii is one of the best rewarding herbs for Vata diseases. Various preparations of C. wightii used in sciatica, hemiplegia, gout, rheumatic diseases, facial paralysis etc. C. wightii is beneficial in cleansing and healing of wounds and to reduce oedema due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-septic properties. In digestive ailments also like anorexia, flatulence, worm infestations, piles etc, it works well5,6. C. wightii is known as Marudeshya because it is a plant which grows in arid zone. It exudes a gum resin coming out of cavities (Kaushika, Ulukhala, Kumbholukhala) in form of particles (Kananiryasa) reddish black in colour (Mahishaksa, Kalaniryasa). It removes a number of ailments (Guggulu) particularly obesity (Palankasa) and is antiseptic (Rakshoha) as fumigation. It is also used as incense in god’s worship (Devadhupa)7. C. wightii is known as Ulukhala because it exudes a gum-resin which comes out from cavities. The resin is the best medicine, so it is known as Pura. It is also known as Durg because it is a plant which grows in arid zone8. The classification of C. wightii consist of domain: Eukaryota, kingdom: Plantae, sub-kingdom: Tracheobionta, division: Magnoliophyta, class: Spermatopsida, sub-class: Magnoliidae, order: Sapindales, genus: Commiphora, family: Burseraceae, species: wightii9. The vernacular names of the plant is Mukul, Guggul, Gugal, Gogil, (Hindi), Gukkal, Gukkulu, Maishakshi   (Tamil), Guggala, Gulag, Mukul (Marathi), Gugal, Gugali, Gugar, Guggul, Mukul, (Gujarat ), Gugul, Mahisaksh, Maisakshi  (Telgu) Aflatan, Moql, Moqlearzaqi, Mukulearabi (Arabic), Bhavabhishtha, Bhutahara, ect (Sanskrit)10. Therefore, in this study, the ethnopharmacological review of C. wightii was carried out aimed at providing a detailed précis of the botany, ethnomedicinal uses, pharmacological activities and chemical composition of the species. Research methodology To recognize pertinent information on the botany, medicinal uses, phytochemistry and biological activities of C. wightii, a review was compiled based on scientific literature from various sources including Google Scholar, Web of Science, SciFinder, Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Scielo, Springerlink, Google Patents, Espacenet, BioMed Central (BMC) and Medline.

Stocks. Further literatures were obtained from books, book chapters, theses, websites and conference proceedings. Occurrence and distribution The C. wightii plant present in arid and semi arid climate and it’s tolerant of poor soil. The C. wightii plant mainly distributed in arid area of northern Africa to central Asia, but it most common in Rocky track of western India and Eastern Himalayas. In central Asia the C. wightii plant is distributed in arid areas of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In India it plant found in arid, Rocky tracts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. According to Ayurveda, there are five type of Guggul namely; Krishnan (black), Peet Varn (Yellow), Neel (blue), Kapish (light brown) and Rakt (blood red). It is propagated by seeds and root cuttings11-13.

Volatile oil and its terpenoidal constituents  Monoterpenoids The gum resin of C. wightii yields about 0.4% of essential oil by steam distillation and its chief components are myrcene, dimyrcene, and polymyrcene19. Other components of the oil are eugenol, d-limonene, 𝛼- pinene, (±) linalool, cineole, 𝛼-terpineol, d-𝛼-phellandrene, methylheptanone, bornyl acetate, (±) geraniol, and some other unidentified compounds20. Bhardwaj et al                                                                                                     Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(4-s):613-621 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [615]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO Sesquiterpenoids The gum resin of C. wightii has been reported to contain bicyclic sesquiterpene, cadinene20.  Diterpenoids Diterpenoid constituents from guggulu include 𝛼-camphorene, cembrene-A, cembrene21 and other cembrenoids. Cembrene-A is one of the most elementary tetraenes derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by C-1 to C-14 cyclization. Mukulol (allylcembrol) is a new cembrane alcohol which was isolated from the aerial parts and also from the resin of guggulu22,23. The allylcembrol structure was established by spectral analysis and mild dehydration which yielded cembrene. Other isolated cembrane type diterpenes include isocembrol and 4-epiisocembro. (1𝐸, 4𝐸, 8𝐸)-4,8,14-Trimethyl11-(1-methylethyl)4-methoxycyclotertradeca-1,4,8-triene, (2𝐸, 12𝐸)-2,7,13-trimethyl-9-(1-methylethyl)-15- oxabicyclo [12.1.0] pentadeca-2,12-diene-7-ol and (4𝑍, 6𝐸)-4,7,12,15,15-pentamethylbicylco [9.3.1] pentadeca-4,6-diene-12-olwere novel compounds obtained by bioassay-guided isolation from hexane-soluble portion of the methanol extract of guggulu24.  Triterpenoids Polypodane-type triperpenes, myrrhanol A, B, and C, myrrhanone A, myrrhanone B, myrrhanone A acetate, commipherol, commipherin, and octanordammarane triperpenoid, epimansumbinol have been isolated from the gum resin. The isolation of two more triterpenoidal components has been reported, which are identified as mansumbinone and mansumbinoic acid25-28. The absolute stereo structure of myrrhanol A was determined to be (3𝑆, 5𝑆, 8𝑅, 9𝑅, 10𝑆)-3, 8,30-trihydroxypolypoda-13𝐸, 17𝐸, 21𝐸-triene. Myrrhanol B is 30-oic acid of myrrhanol A with altered stereostructure at C-5 (5𝑅 in contrast to 5𝑆 in myrrhanol A). Myrrhanone A and B are 3-keto analogue of myrrhanol A and B, respectively26. A myrrhanone derivative, (13𝐸, 17𝐸, 21𝐸)-8-hydroxypolypoda-13, 17, 21-trien-3-one and a myrrhanol derivative, (13𝐸, 17𝐸, 21𝐸)-polypoda-13, 17, 21-trien-3, 18-diol have also been isolated24. 2. Steroids Isolation of several steroidal constituents has been reported from the gum resin. The major constituents include E-guggulsterone, Z-guggulsterone, guggulsterol-1, guggulsterolII, guggulsterol-III, guggulsterol-IV, guggulsterol-V and guggulsterol-VI. Other isolated steroids are 20𝛼-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, 20𝛽-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, and 16𝛽- hydroxy-4, 17 (20)-Z-pregnadien-3-ones which has been designated as Z-guggulsterol29-32. Progesterone and related steroids, 4-pregnene-3, 16-dione, (20R)- 20-acetoxy-4-pregnene-3,16-dione,16𝛽-acetyloxypregn4,17(20)-trans-diene-3-one, 3𝛼-acetyloxy5𝛼-pregnan-16-one and 20R,22R-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one have also been isolated27. Cholesterol has also been reported. Three new and recently isolated steroids are guggulsterone-M, dihydro guggulsterone-M and guggulsterol-Y28. The steroidal constituents have been related with hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities of the drug24.  3. Flavonoids An ethanolic extract of trunk of C. wightii was separated on column packed with silica gel to give a new antifungal flavone named muscanone along with known naringenin. Muscanone was found to be active against C. albicans in microbial sensitive assay. The major flavonoid components of the flowers of C. wightii were identified as quercetin, quercetin-3-O-𝛼-L-arabinose), quercetin3-O-𝛽-D-glucuronide, quercetin-3-O-𝛽-Dgalactoside, quercetin-3-O-𝛼-L-rhamnoside and pelargonidin-3, 5, di-O-glucoside32,33.  4. Guggultetrols A crystalline material was isolated from the saponified gum resin which was characterized as a mixture of octadecan-1,2,3,4-tetrol, nonadecan1,2,3,4-tetrol and eicosan-1,2,3,4-tetrol with minor amount of other components, possibly lower (C-16 and C-17) and higher (C-21 and C-22) homologous tetrols. These compounds constitute a new class of naturally occurring lipids, guggultetrols. They are long-chain linear aliphatic tetrols with hydroxyl functions at C-1, C-2, C3, and C-4 positions. Through derivatization and preparative GLC, guggultetrol-18 and guggultetrol-20 were obtained in pure form. A mixture of two ferulates (𝑛 = 16, 17) with an unusual skeleton was found to be responsible for the cytotoxic action of the drug. They have been isolated from cytotoxic fraction of ethyl acetate extract of guggulu. It was identified as a mixture of esters based on homologous longchain tetrols and acid34,35. 5. Lignans Two lignans, sesamin29 and diayangambin36 have been reported from guggulu. Also, 5,5-tetrahydro-1𝐻,3𝐻-furo[3,4-c]furan-1,4-diylbis[7- (methoxy)-1,3-benzodioxole] has been reported from methanolic extract of guggulu24. 6. Sugars Complete hydrolysis of gum part of resin yielded L-arabinose, D-galactose, L-fructose (traces) and 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid. Graded hydrolysis of the gum furnished an aldobiouronic acid [6-O-(4-O-methyl-𝛽- D-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-D-galactose]. Hydrolysis of methylated gum furnished 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-Dgalactose, 2,3-di-O-methyl-L-arabinose, 2,3,4-tri-O-methylD-galactose, 2,4-di-O-methyl-D-galactose, and 2,3,4-tri-Omethyl-D-glucuronic acid in the ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1. The provisional structure showed the gum to be a highly branched polysaccharide containing 1-6, 1-3,- and 1-5 type of linkage37,38. 7. Amino Acids C. wightii was extracted with alcohol and the extract after removal of the solvent was partitioned between water and ether. The aqueous fraction was chromatographed and it showed the presence of various amino acids. The amino acids detected were cystine, histidine, lysine, arginine, aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, threonine, alanine, proline, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine, and isoleucine39. Cultivation  C. wightii is sought for its gummy resin, which is harvested from the plant’s bark through the process of tapping. In India, C. wightii is cultivated commercially. It can successively be propagated by vegetative means. The rooting initiates 21 days after sprouting and 300mm, long 15 and 15mm diameter cutting gives the maximum rooting. As it is a plant of arid zone, there is no necessity of irrigation upto the middle of November except during drought. However, if there is the winter shower, there is a necessity of irrigation to plants of one to five years of age group. The plants of 6-7 years of age group require irrigation only in summer season. Irrigation can be done either by head load method or water tank method40,41. Medicinal uses The use of C. wightii plant in the treatment of diseases occupies an important place in ayurveda, the traditional medicine system of india. The Atharvaveda one of the four well known holy scriptures (Vedas) of the Hindus, the Atharvaveda is the earliest reference for it medicinel and therapeutic properties42. Detained description regarding it action, use and induction as well as the varieties of guggul have been described in numerous Ayurvedic treat including Charaka samhita (1000 BC), Sushruta Samhita (600 BC and Vagbhata seventh century AD). In addition, various medical lexicons were return between twelth and forteen centuries AD.

C. wightii is a gum resin, historically used for antiseptic and deep penetrating action in the treatment of elevated blood cholesterol and Arthritis. C. wightii is effective as weight loss and fat burning agent. It increase white blood cell count and possess strong disinfecting properties. Used as a carrier and combined with other herbs to treat specific condition44,49,50. Traditionally, C. wightii plant is given in the form of YOG, where in C. wightii is mixed with other drug’s along with castor oil or Indian clarified butter. The YOG could also be prepared by cooking the C. wightii with water, and other herbal drug powder. Popular Ayurvedic formulated containing C. wightii are: Yograj gugguluvati, Pachamrit ioh guggulu, Kaishore gugguluvayi, Triphla guggulu and Sinhaguggluvati51. C. wightii has been a key component in ancient Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine and now widely use in Morden medicine for treatment of heart ailments. But C. wightii as it’s locally known, has become so scarce because of its overuse in it two habitats in india where it found-Gujarat and Rajasthan. The extract, called guggulipid, comes from the C. wightii tree and has been used in Ayurvedic medicine, a traditional Hindu medicine, for nearly 3000 years in India. Today it existence is threatened because of iow seed production in an adverse natural condition and recent environmental change due to rainfall pattern and increasing level of atmospheric pollution. This plant species is fighting for its survival in the natural habitat since a long time. Attempts have been made in this direction by number of researchers including under present investigation towards its natural populations, germ-plasm collection, cultivation techniques, Phytosociology and regeneration potentialities etc. at different site of Western Indian Thar desert44,52. The oleo-gum resin commonly known as “gum guggul” or “Indian Myrrh” is the economically important product of Indian bdellium. The oleo-gum is collected as exudates from woody stem. A plant generally takes 10 years to reach tapping maturity under the dry climate conditions. The thick branch is incised during the winter to extract the oleo-gum resin. Guggul gum is a mixture of 61% resin, and 29.3% gum, in addition to 6.1% water, 0.6% volatile oil and 3.2% foreign matter53. Reported pharmacological activities  Hypolipidemic/ Hypocholesterolaemic activity  1. Crude Guggulu was reported to possess highly encouraging hypolipaemic activity in rabbits54.  2. Anion exchange property detected by means of chloride retention and bile acid sequestrating activity in the oleoresin fraction hypocholesterolaemic activity55.  3. Crude drug as well as its two fractions (alcohol soluble and alcohol insoluble) were found to cause a significant fall in serum cholesterol and serum turbidity with a concomitant increase in the coagulation time and prothrombin time. The alcohol insoluble fraction was slightly more potent in this respect than alcohol soluble fraction as well as crude Guggulu56.  4. PE fraction A (petrol-soluble), B (alkali washed neutral portion) and C (petrol-insoluble) were given to 8 week old male white leg horn chicks for 2-3 weeks in hypercholesterolaemia induced by atherogenic diet. All fractions lower the serum cholesterol, but fraction A is most potent and B is the least potent57. 5. Alcohol extract and two pure fractions (a terpenoid and a steroid) isolated from the PE extract showed that the steroid fraction was highly potent as hypolipaemic agent lowering the serum cholesterol by 69.3% as well as the c/p ratio. The alcohol extract could lower the cholesterol by 59.2% whereas the Terpenoid lowered it by 54.3%58. 6. The alcohol extract of Guggulu when orally administrated to Indian domestic pigs kept on standard atherogenic diet over a period of six weeks effectively reduced the total serum cholesterol and also serum beta-lipoprotein fraction and significantly altered the lipoprotein ratio59.  7. The steroidal compound isolated from fraction A of PE extract reduced the lipid content (Viz., total lipids, cholesterol, TG and phospholipids) of both hepatic and aortic tissues. The response was doses-dependent and the maximum effect was noted at 10mg/kg60.  8. Fraction A of PE extract of C. mukul, effectively lowered serum lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides in monkeys fed with cholesterol diet61.  9. Alcoholic extract (25-50 mg/kg orally), reduced serum cholesterol level in normal and hyperlipaemic rats and rabbits. Further, a resin fraction, a pure steroid and fraction F isolated from crude extract showed hypocholesterolaemic effect on normal and triton-induced hyperlipaemic rats62,63.  10. The hypolipidemic activity was shown in animals as well as in patients of obesity and hypercholesterolemia64.  11. A number of clinical studies were carried out to confirm hypolipidemic activity of guggulu and gugulipid65,66. 12. In another study, highly significant reduction in levels of mean serum cholesterol and triglyceride was observed in groups of animals receiving high-fat diet for one month along with guggulu, which clearly demonstrated its hypolipidemic activity. Additionally, administration of guggulu partially reversed the atherosclerosis in the aorta that was induced by high-fat diet67 . 13. Clinical studies on C. mukul showed its hypolipidemic effect and the outcome of change in lipid profile upon its administration. This study showed significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol after treatment with guggulu68. 14. The hypolipidemic activity of the isomers 𝐸-guggulsterone and𝑍-guggulsterone has also been studied in animalmodels. Administration of guggulsterone (𝑍 and 𝐸) significantly lowered serumlipid levels of rats with either triton (WR-1339) or cholesterol-induced hyperlipidemia69.  Effect on Platelet Aggregation and Fibrinolytic Activity 1. The purified steroid mixture from guggulu completely inhibited ADP, adrenaline, or serotonin induced platelet aggregation. No difference was observed between the effectiveness of the steroid mixture and the purified guggulsterone 𝐸 or 𝑍. The effect of guggulsterones 𝐸 and 𝑍 was very similar to the inhibitory effect of clofibrate. This finding has therapeutic value in myocardial infarction and thromboembolism70. 2. The effect of guggulu on fibrinolysis and platelet adhesiveness in coronary heart disease was studied. Bhardwaj et al                                                                                                     Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(4-s):613-621 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [617]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO Guggulu fraction A (pet ether extract) in daily dose of 1 g was administered to healthy individuals (group I) and to patients of coronary artery disease (CAD) (group II) for a period of 30 days. Serum fibrinolytic activity increased, while the platelet adhesive index decreased, which was statistically significant in healthy individuals and in CAD patients. In view of this, guggulu fraction A may be a useful therapeutic agent in the management of coronary artery disease71.  Thyroid Stimulatory Activity 1. Administration of ethanolic extract of guggulu to the female albino mice for 15 days enhanced the triiodothyonine (T3) concentration and T3/T4 ratio,while nomarked change in the concentrations of serum thyroxine (T4) was observed72. 2. 𝑍-Guggulsterone was shown to be responsible for the thyroid stimulatory action of guggulu. Administration of isolated 𝑍-guggulsterone to rats led to significant increase in all thyroid function parameters, namely, uptake of iodine by the thyroid, enzymes involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and tissue oxygen uptake, thus suggesting thyroid stimulatory action73.  Anti-inflammatory and Anti-arthritic activity 1. Oleoresin was found to be highly potent anti-inflammatory agent, as compared to hydrocortisone and butazoladin against Brownlee’s for maldehyde-induced arthritis in albino rats74.  2. Oleoresin fraction possesed significant anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory activities, the minimum effective dose being 12.5mg/100g body weight. Only the acidic fraction showed significant activity while the monoacid and solid fractions were inactive75 .  3. The Steroidal compound isolated from PE extract possessed significant anti-inflammatory activity on carrageenin-induced rat-paw oedema76,77. 4. The results of several studies confirm anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activities of guggulu78-82.  5. The 50 percent aqueous methanolic extract was found to exhibit an anti-inflammatory effect on adjuvant-induced air pouch granuloma in mice. The methanolic extract inhibited nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide activated mouse peritoneal macrophages83. 6. Guggulosomes prepared using guggul with ibuprofen by bath sonication and trituration methods were studied for anti-inflammatory activity. It was clearly shown that guggulosomes had more efficacy than ibuprofen and both guggul and ibuprofen had synergistic effect. The study proved that guggul could serve as a carrier for entrapping drugs and for their sustained release action84.  7. Several animal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of guggulu extract in standard osteoarthritis (OA) models. The authors had conducted both animal and clinical investigations of guggulu for OA prior to this study. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of guggulu for reduction of pain, stiffness, and other symptoms that arise from OA85.    Antiatherosclerotic Activity 1. LDL has been found to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and is the major source of the cholesterol accumulation in human foamcells.There is evidence that LDL oxidation is essential for atherogenesis and the antioxidants that prevent this oxidation may either slow down or prevent atherogenesis. Guggulsterones, the lipidlowering components of guggulu, effectively inhibited in vitro LDL oxidation (as discussed under antioxidant action). Thus the combination of antioxidant and lipid-lowering properties of guggulu makes it especially beneficial against atherogenesis86.  Cardioprotective Activity 1. Guggulsterones are shown to be effective cardioprotectives. Myocardial necrosis induced by isoproterenol in rats caused marked increase in serum creatine phosphokinase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase. Phospholipase, xanthine oxidase, and lipid peroxides were simultaneously enhanced in ischemic heart following depletion of glycogen, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Treatment with guggulsterone at a dose of 50mg/kg significantly protected cardiac damage as assessed by the reversal of blood and heart biochemical parameters in ischemic rats87 .  Antifertility Activity 1. Guggulu administered orally (2 and 20mg/100 g body weight) to female rats decreased the weight of the uterus, ovaries, and cervix, whereas glycogen and sialic acid levels in these organs increased. This suggested that guggulu may be useful as an antifertility agent88.  Skin Diseases 1. Administration of gugulipid was reported to be effective in the treatment of nodulocystic acne. A study in 21 patients found that gugulipid was as effective as tetracycline in the treatment. The patients with oily faces responded better to the gugulipid treatment89.  Antihyperglycemic Activity 1. Administration of alcoholic extract of C. mukul at a dose of 200mg/kg for 60 continuous days reduced plasma glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats90. 2. A study showing effect of guggulsterone isolated from C. mukul in high-fat diet induced diabetic rats has also been reported.Different biochemical parameters like GTT, glycogen content, glucose homeostatic enzymes (like glucose-6-phosphatase and hexokinase), insulin release in vivo, and expression profiles of various genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism clearly demonstrated the hypoglycemic effect.Theresults suggested that guggulsterone has both hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects which can help cure type II diabetes91.  Antimicrobial Activity 1. The volatile oil of C mukul was found to be highly effective against Rhyzopertha dominica which suggested its role as a fumigant. The ethanolic extract of C. mukul exhibited best antibacterial activity at 5mg/ ml against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia92.  2. An active compound, 5(1-methyl,1-aminoethyl)-5-methyl-2- octanone, of the methanolic extract of guggulu gum possessed significant antibacterial Bhardwaj et al                                                                                                     Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(4-s):613-621 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [618]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO activity against Gram-positive bacteria and moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria93-95.  Cytotoxic Activity 1. Ferulate compounds are used in the method for prevention and treatment of abnormal cell growth and proliferation of inflammation, neoplasia, and cardiovascular disease. Ethyl acetate extract showed significant in vitro cytotoxicity. A fraction showing cytotoxic activity was characterized as a mixture of two ferulates with an unusual skeleton by spectral and chemicalmethods.This fraction also showed moderate scavenging effect against 2,2-diphenyl-1- picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radicals96.Treatment with gugulipid significantly inhibited the viability of human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (androgendependent)and its androgen-independent variant (C-81) with IC50 of 1 𝜇M(24 h treatment), thus indicating its possible role in apoptosis and cancer prevention96. The results of this study indicated that guggulsterone inhibited proliferation of PC-3 cells in culture by causing apoptosis, whereas a normal prostate epithelial cell line is resistant to growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by this phytoconstituent. These observations provided rationale for further preclinical andclinical evaluationof guggulsterone for its efficacy against prostate cancer97. Substitutes and Adulterants  Oleo-gum resin obtained from Boswellia serrata Roxb. (Salai guggulu) is the major adulterant. It is distinguished by its yellowish green, golden or milky tears, seldom amalgamated into lumps and a characteristic terpentine like odour. Gum-oleo-resin of Commiphora myrrha (Nees) Engl. imported from Africa and constituting the drug Hirabole or bole of commerce is sometimes mixed with Guggulu. Similarly, gum-oleo-resin obtained from Commiphora roxburghii (Arn) Engl., Occurring in central and eastern India is sold by the name of Guggulu. The former is distinguished by large tears of yellowish brown colour, exposing, on fracture, a brown surface having white markings, while the latter has a bluish tinge and a feeble balasmic odour98. Possible Reasons for Its Decline  Several reasons are cited for the plant being listed as en-dangered species and some of these are considered to be of greater consequences affecting its population survival. The various factors are: slow growth, poor seed-setting and seed germination rate, lack of cultivation, unsustain-able over-exploitation, excessive and unscientific tapping method, invasion of alien species99-101. These have been listed below. 1. Unscientific method of tapping and overexploitation 2. Low seed setting 3. Regeneration through seeds 4. Invasion of alien species 5. Others  Narrow extent of occurrence, small area of occupancy and severe fragmentation, as other reasons for conservation threat and extinction risk.  It has never been brought under cultivation.  The changing environment and existing natural populations of this species has been af-fected by climatic conditions, soil erosion, low rainfall, termite infestation, over-grazing by domestic animals and mining activities. Safety and Toxicity It has beenmentioned in Ayurvedic texts that administration of raw guggulu may sometimes lead to skin rashes, irregular menstruation, diarrhoea, headache, mild nausea, and, with very high doses, liver toxicity102. In order to overcome the side effects of raw guggulu, Ayurveda describes a number of purification processes (shodhan vidhi) in different “dravyas,” that is, fluids, which not only take care of the adverse effects but also enhance the therapeutic activity17. It is also mentioned in Ayurvedic texts that guggulu must be purified before incorporation into herbal formulations. There are a large number of commercial polyherbal anti-inflammatory formulations which are using guggulu as the chief ingredient82. The clinical trials done with standardized gum guggul extracts reported transient side effects such as skin rashes, diarrhoea, and irregular menstruations. A report also states that, out of 22 individuals receiving 2160mg guggulu daily for 12 weeks, 10 persons experienced one or another side effect including gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, and skin rash103. Skin rashes have also been reported in other trials using 1-2 g guggulipid (ethyl acetate fraction) daily for a month. This study did not report any intestinal distress104 . Although generally accepted as relatively safe, caution may be warranted during guggul consumption. There is little or no information on toxicity with the use of guggulu. Conclusion In the present review, we have made an effort to provide the mophological, phytochemical, ethnopharmacological and pharmacological information on C. wightii, a tree used conventionally for medicinal purposes. A variety of extracts and chemical compounds of the plant have shown Hypolipidemic/ hypocholesterolaemic activity, Effect on platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic activity, thyroid stimulatory activity, antioxidant, antibacterial, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory and hypoglycaemic activities. Its phytochemical composition indicates the presence of diterpenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, longchain aliphatic tetrols, aliphatic esters, ferulates, lignans, carbohydrates, and a variety of inorganic ions besides minor amounts of sesamin and other unidentified constituents. A large number of compounds have been isolated from C. wightii and shown to possess assorted biological properties. In addition, crude extracts of the plant and their solvent fractions are connected with diverse pharmacological activities. Ethnopharmacological research on C. wightii is heartening as phytochemical profiling, nutritional and biological activities of the species could support the documented medicinal uses, nutritional and nutraceutical properties of C. wightii. Comprehensive research on phytochemical properties, biological activities, pharmacokinetics and clinical trials of C. wightii is required as this will present further confirmation for the nutritional, ethnopharmacology and nutraceutical potential of C. wightii. Further research should center on experimental in vitro, in vivo studies and toxicological evaluation of C. wightii and its phytochemical compounds.
