ABSTRACT  
Objective: Nilavembu Kudineer Chooranam is the combination of nine plant materials. The nine components are Nilavempu (Andrographis 
paniculata), Vettiver (Vetiveria zizanioides), Vilamiccamver (plectranthus vettiveroides), Santanam (Santalum album), Peyputtal (Trichosanthes 
dioica), Koraikkilanku (Cyperus rotandus), Cukku (Zingeber officinale), Milaku (Piper nigrum), Parpatakam (Mollugo cerviana). All these plants 
are used conventionally in the treatment of fever, inflammation, arthralgia, arthritis, gastric ulcer, jaundice, and general weakness conditions.  
Methods: About 500gm of dried fine powder of Santalum album were soaked in the extractor and macerated for 30 hrs with petroleum ether. 
On the 22ndday after overnight fast the blood was collected from retro- orbital plexus. After the separation of serum from the blood assay of 
ALT, AST, ALP, γGT and bilirubin were done using standard methods and enzyme assay tests.  
Results: The preliminary phytochemical analysis of the Chloroform extract of Santalum album reveals the presence of alkaloid, flavonoid, 
phenol, coumarin, and tannin. The pretreatment of chloroform extract of Santalum album at a dose of 200mg and 400mg/kg (group IV and V) 
appeared to significantly prevent the galactosamine toxicity as revealed by the hepatic cells which were preserved in cytoplasms.  
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that chloroform extract of Santalum album at both doses possesses hepatoprotective and antioxidant 
activity, which is evidenced by lowered serum hepatic marker enzyme activities. Among the two dosages tested, 400 mg/kg/body weight 
showed more promising hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity, and is comparable to the standard drug Silymarin.

INTRODUCTION: 
Siddha, Ayurveda, and Unani are the three medicinal 
systems of India. That is practiced from ancient time to this 
modern era. Among this Siddha which originated in the 
Southern part of India is the best conventional medicinal 
system in the world as it treats together with the body, mind 
and the soul. In this sera, it has been proved that Nilavembu 
Kudineer Chooranam (NKC) is bestowed with many 
therapeutic potentials and is considered as one of the best 
medicines in Siddha. It is regarded as a perfect health drink 
to cure many diseases. Nilavembu Kudineer Chooranam is 
the combination of nine plant materials. The nine 
components are Nilavempu (Andrographis paniculata), 
Vettiver (Vetiveria zizanioides), Vilamiccamver (plectranthus 
vettiveroides), Santanam (Santalum album), Peyputtal 
(Trichosanthes dioica), Koraikkilanku (Cyperus rotandus), 
Cukku (Zingeber officinale), Milaku (Piper nigrum), 
Parpatakam (Mollugo cerviana). Equal Proportion of the 
above nine ingredients are used in NKC 1. All these plants are 
used conventionally in the treatment of fever, inflammation, 
arthralgia, arthritis, gastric ulcer, jaundice, and general 
Kamalarajan et al                                                                                             Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2019; 9(4-A):176-182 
 
ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                  [177]                                                                                 CODEN (USA): JDDTAO 
weakness conditions 2-4. Among the nine components, the 
Santalum album plays a vital role contributing largely to the 
medicinal values of NKC. It is learned from the ancient 
Indian the plant has played Medicinal System that the plant 
Santalum album (L.) has played a significant role as it has 
been used as an astringent, antipyretic, blood purifier, 
disinfectant in bronchial and genitourinary tract infections, 
diuretic, expectorant, memory enhancer, and sedative, the 
tonic for heart, liver and stomach 5. The present study aims 
at the evaluation of the hepatoprotective potential of 
Santalum album (stem) against paracetamol-induced 
hepatotoxicity. According to the literature of Siddha and 
Ayurveda NKC improves liver functions. The 
hepatoprotective activity of NKC warrants a scientific 
pharmacological study. The preliminary phytochemical 
analysis of the Chloroform extract of Santalum album reveals 
the presence of alkaloid, flavonoid, phenol, coumarin, and 
tannin. Hepatoprotective screening of Santalum album 
renders a better method for the evaluation of liver 
protecting the role of NKC. The model system of liver 
damage produced by D-galactosamine (GalN) is comparable 
with viral hepatitis in humans morphologically and 
functionally 6. As a result, this model is now accepted as one 
of the most authentic test systems of liver damage in 
experimental animals. GalN has great liver specificity 
because the hepatocytes have high levels of galactokinase 
and galactose-1-P-uridylyltransferase. 
Meanwhile, other organs are not affected 7-8. GalN causes 
liver cell injury, with spotty hepatocyte necrosis and 
prominent portal and parenchymal inflammation 9. GalN also 
causes depletion of uridine diphosphate (UDP). GaIn 
converts uridine diphosphate (UDP) into UDP-sugar 
derivatives. Inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis by UDP-
sugar derivatives leads to deterioration of the cell 
membranes 10-11. Developing nations use medicinal plants 
for primary health care. The human body responds well 
when herbal drugs are administrated. 
MATERIALS & METHODS: 
The whole plant of Santalum album was collected from 
authenticate herbal trader, Mylapore, Chennai, Tamilnadu, 
shade dried for a week in a shadow and blended to a coarse 
powder. Then a Taxonomist authenticated the plant sample. 
About 500gm of dried fine powder of Santalum album were 
soaked in the extractor and macerated for 30 hrs with 
petroleum ether. There it is reflexed successfully with ethyl 
acetate, after that it is extracted with chloroform by 
continuous hot percolation method using soxhlet apparatus 
for 40hrs separately. The chloroform extract was filtered 
and concentrated in vacuum using rotary flask evaporator 
under reduced pressure. After concentration chloroform 
extract of Santalum album gave a brownish residue that was 
stored in an airtight container. 
Animals In-house laboratory-bred six weeks old Wistar rats 
were selected for the study. Animals were maintained under 
the controlled temperature at 20±20 °C and relative 
humidity of 50-60% with an alternating 12hr light/ dark 
cycle. The animals were acclimatized for one week before 
the study and had free access to standard laboratory feed 
and water ad libitum.  
Study Design 
Rats of body weight 180-220 g were selected. The total 
number of 30 rats was divided into five groups of 5 animals 
each. 
Group I: Normal Control: The animals received distilled 
water 5 ml/kg b.w. p.o. for 21 days. Group II: Toxicant N-
Galactosamine Group: Also received distilled water 5ml/kg 
b.w. p.o. for 21 days. A dose of D-Gal N in D.W. 400 mg/kg 
b.w was given i.p. after one hour of the vehicle12. 
Group III: Standard Silymarin Group: The animals 
received silymarin 75 mg/kg b.w. p.o. was given for 21days. 
The animals received a single dose of D-Gal N in D.W 400 
mg/kg b.wi.p after 1 hour of std drug on the 21st day. 
Group IV Toxicant + Santalum album: 200 mg/kg was p.o. 
for 21 days. A dose of D-Gal N in D.W 400 mg/kg b.w. was 
given i.p. after 1 hour of the test drug. 
Group V Toxicant + Santalum album: 400 mg/kg was p.o. 
for 21 days. The animals received a dose of D-GalN in 
D.W.400 mg /kg b.w.p.o after 1 hour of the test drug. 
Biochemical Parameters: On the 22ndday after overnight 
fast, the blood was collected from retro-orbital plexus. 
Before centrifugation at 2500 rpm for ten minutes, blood 
was allowed to clot. After the separation of serum from the 
blood assay of alanine transaminase [ALT] 13, aspartate 
transaminase [AST] 14, alkaline phosphatase [ALP] 15, γ –
glutamyl transferase [γGT] 16 and bilirubin were done using 
standard methods and enzyme assay tests. Transasia Bio-
medicals Ltd Kit for ALT, AST, LDH and Accurex Biomedicals 
Ltd Kit for γ GGT & ALP. The enzyme assays were performed 
on a semi-autoanalyzer ERBA Chem. 
Evaluation of Biochemical Parameters: The livers were 
dissected out immediately, washed with ice-cold saline and 
10% homogenates in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) 
were prepared. The following biochemical measurements 
were carried out in the liver tissues. Liver homogenate was 
used for the assay of MOA while some fraction of 
homogenates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 
ºC using refrigerated centrifuge, and the supernatants were 
used for the assay of Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase 
(CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 17-19 by standard 
methods using enzyme assay kits. The enzyme assays were 
performed on a semi-auto analyser ERBA Chem. 
Histopathological Observation: The liver from each group 
was aseptically excused stored separately for analysis of 
oxidative stress-related biomarkers and in phosphate - 
buffered formalin (10%) for histopathological evaluation. 
Statistical Analysis: The Statistical analysis was carried out 
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by 
NewmannKeul’s multiple range tests. The values are 
represented as Mean ± SEM. Probability value at p < 0.01 
was considered statistically significant.

RESULT: 
Phytochemical screening 
The extract of Nilavembu Kudineer Chooranam was 
subjected to qualitative chemical examination for the 
presence of alkaloid, carbohydrates, flavanoids, tannin, and 
phenolic compound are reported in table -1. 
Biochemical observations 
Significant increase in (P< 0 .01) Serum Aspartate 
Transaminase (AST) , Alanine Transaminase (ALT) , Alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) , Total bilirubin (TB) and Gamma-
glutamyltranspeptidase(GGTP) and significant decrease in 
(P< 0.01) Total protein(TP) and Total albumin(TA) levels 
were observed in animals treated with 
galactosamine400mg/kg (Group II) as compared to normal 
control group(Group I). 
Pretreatment with chloroform extract of Santalum album at 
a dose 200mg and 400mg/kg, orally for 21days decreased 
the levels of above indices like AST, ALT, ALP, TB, GGTP and 
increased levels of TP and TA significantly(P <0.01)in group 
IV and V. 
Silymarin pretreatment produced a significant decrease in 
(P< 0.01) serum AST, ALT, ALP, TB, GGTP  and the significant 
increase in TP and TA  at (P< 0.01) in group III. 
Biochemical  observation in liver homogenate tissue 
In liver homogenate, there was a significant decrease in SOD, 
CAT and GPx levels and increase in LPO levels were 
observed in animals treated with galactosamine400mg/kg 
(group II) as compared to the normal control group (Group 
I). 
Pretreatment with chloroform extract of Santalum album at 
a dose 200mg and 400mg /kg orally for 21 days increase the 
levels of above indices like SOD, CAT and GPx levels and 
decrease levels of LPO significantly (P<0.01) in group IV and 
V. 
Silymarin pretreatment produced a significant increase in 
(P< 0.01) Liver homogenate enzyme such as SOD, CAT, GPx 
levels and decrease the levels of LPO significantly (P<0.01) 
in group III. 
Table 4 shows the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants such 
as reduced glutathione, Vitamin C and Vitamin E in the 
tissues (liver) of D-galactosamine hepatotoxic and control 
rats. There was a significant decrease in the levels of 
nonenzymatic antioxidant in D-galactosamine hepatotoxic 
rats. The chloroform extract of Santalum album at a dose 
200mg and 400mg/kg administered rats showed 
significantly increased levels of these non-enzymic 
antioxidants as compared with untreated hepatotoxic rats. 
Histopathological observations 
Normal liver architecture was observed in the histology of 
liver sections of normal control animals (Group I). Liver 
section of control healthy rats showed normal hepatic 
lobular architecture. The hepatocytes were within normal 
limits and arranged in thin plates.No fibrous tissue or 
lymphocytes deposition were observed. Ther was the 
presence of cytoplasm and prominent nucleus and nucleolus 
(Fig no: 1). The liver sections of galactosamine treated 
animals (Group II) showed hepatic cells with serum toxicity 
characterized by inflammatory cell collection, scattered 
inflammation across liver parenchyma, focal necrosis and 
swelling up of vascular endothelial cells (Fig no:2). 
Silymarin (Group-III) exhibited protection from 
galactosamine-induced changes in the liver (Fig no: 3). 
The pretreatment of chloroform extract of Santalum album 
at a dose of 200mg and 400mg/kg (group IV and V) 
appeared to significantly prevent the galactosamine toxicity 
as revealed by the hepatic cells which were preserved in 
cytoplasms. The pretreatment of Chloroform extract of 
Santalum album also caused a marked decrease in

DISCUSSION: 
D-galactosamine is a hepatotoxicant. It injures the liver. 
Liver injury caused by D-galactosamine is similar to that of 
viral hepatitis.D-galactosamine disturbs the metabolism in 
the cells of the liver resulting in changes in the serum 
enzyme activities. The elevated serum enzymes indicate the 
cellular leakage and loss of functions of the hepatocyte 20. 
Enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin,and 
gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase are released into the blood 
veins when the liver cell plasma membrane is damaged. The 
in-vivo measurement of the above mentioned quantitative 
markers indicates the quantity and quality of hepatocellular 
damage. 
In D-galactosamine induced toxicity, increased activities of 
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase and decrease activities of complete protein 
and total albumin were observed in serum. The chloroform 
extract of Santalum album seems to preserve the structural 
integrity of the hepatocyte membrane resulting in the 
significant reduction in the activities of these enzymes. The 
400mg/kg dose had a better effect than the low dose of the

chloroform extract of Santalum album (200mg/kg). The 
higher concentration might have resulted in the production 
of more byproducts that would have interfered with the 
activity. Treatment with chloroform extract of Santalum 
album significantly decreased these enzyme activities, 
indicating that chloroform extract of Santalum album has a 
hepatoprotective effect against a D-galactosamine-induced 
liver injury. 
The formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH·) 
and lipid peroxidation are the harmful oxidative effects of  D-
galactosamine. Consequently, the cell membrane is 
destructed 21. The evidence clearly shows that the D-
galactosamine toxicity and lipid peroxidation damages the 
kidney 22. The presence of reduced antioxidants was 
observed in the kidney. The previous studies show that D-
galactosamine-induced rats significantly increased 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid hydroperoxides 
and conjugated dienes in liver and kidney. In the present 
study, the observation indicates an increase in the levels of 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid hydroperoxides 
and conjugated dienes in the tissues of D-galactosamine-
hepatotoxic rats. Increased lipid peroxidation in various 
tissues has long been known to cause functional 
degradation; thus, the deterioration of vital tissue leading to 
complications may be indirectly due to increased oxidative 
stress. Treatment with chloroform extract of Santalum 
album and silymarin showed a significant reduction which 
might be due to the antioxidant ability of these compounds 
and the consequent decrease in lipid peroxidation. The 
chloroform extract of Santalum album possesses 
antioxidative and free-radical scavenging effects. 
 Due to Oxidative stress, cell and tissue lack the antioxidant 
defense and the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen 
species. Lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and the 
inactivation of many enzymes are other ill effects of 
oxidative stress 23. The enzymatic antioxidant defense 
system is the natural protector against lipid peroxidation 
that includes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione 
peroxidase. Reduced activities of these enzymes in the tissue 
of D-galactosamine- hepatotoxic rats were observed in our 
study. Superoxide dismutase protects against the superoxide 
radical (O2∙−), which damages the membrane and its 
biological structure. Catalase primarily decomposes 
hydrogen peroxide to H2O at a much faster rate, sharing this 
function with glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione peroxidise 
removes lipid hydroperoxides. These enzymes remove 
oxygen radicals from tissues 24.  
Due to the increase in the levels of superoxide radicals and 
H2O2 the liver enzymes become inactive leading to death. 
The administration of chloroform extract of Santalum album 
significantly increased the activities of these enzymes. 
The non-enzymic scavengers like glutathione, ascorbic acid, 
and α-tocopherol, defend the residual free radicals escaping 
from decomposition by the antioxidant enzymes.  These 
scavengers play the second line defense. Moreover, enzymic 
antioxidants are inactivated by the excessive levels of free 
radicals, and hence the presence of non-enzymic 
antioxidants is presumably essential for the removal of these 
radicals 25. 
Glutathione is a major non-protein thiol found in a living 
organism. It protects important thiol group from oxidation 
by combining with reactive oxygen species and electrophilic 
metabolites. It is perceived that the glutathione behaves as a 
substrate for enzyme like glutathione peroxidase. The 
lowered glutathione in D-galactosamine induced rats 
represent the increased utilization of glutathione as a result 
of oxidative stress. Perturbation in the redox status of 
glutathione not only impairs cellular defense against toxic 
compounds but also results in enhanced oxidative stress and 
oxidative injury 26. Free-radical scavengers protect cell 
membrane against poisonous agents.  
α-tocopherol (Vitamin E) and ascorbic acids (Vitamin C) are 
important free radical scavengers 27. They prevent oxidative 
damage under all types of oxidative stress. Ascorbic acid 
possesses excellent power to trap lipid peroxy radical in the 
aqueous phase producing dehydro dehydroascorbate. The 
conversion of the dehydroascorbate into ascorbate is known 
as thiol cycle consisting of a GSSG/GSH couple. The active 
form of vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) is kept up in the cells by 
glutathione. Reduction in glutathione lowers ascorbic acid 
content. D-galactosamine hepatotoxic rats are found to have 
reduced glutathione α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid levels 
due to an antioxidant defense against increased ROS. 
Ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol decreased the hepatotoxic 
levels in the rats with liver injury, which received D-
galactosamine dosage. This study observes the increase in 
the levels of these antioxidants in chloroform extract of 
Santalum album and silymarin administered rats. 
It is confirmed that chloroform extract of Santalum album 
inhibited lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant present in the 
extract accounts for the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The 
anti-hepatotoxic activity of the chloroform extract 
counteracts the free radical-mediated tissue damage.  
Antioxidants are flavonoid s. Flavonoids contain hydroxyl 
groups. Hydroxyl groups present in ring B of polyphenols 
are essential for the free radical scavenging mechanism of 
the anti-oxidants. The chloroform extract of Santalum album 
contains flavonoids. A high dose of 400 mg/kg body weight 
chloroform exatract of Santalum album  improved the 
hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity in the rats having 
D-galactosamine-induced hepatitis. 
CONCLUSION: 
The findings demonstrated that chloroform extract of 
Santalum album at both doses possesses hepatoprotective 
and antioxidant activities. The lowered serum hepatic 
marker enzyme activities confirmed the antihepatotoxicity 
of plant extract. Among the two dosages tested, 400 
mg/kg/body weight showed more promising 
hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities and is 
comparable to the standard drug Silymarin. The observed 
significant hepatoprotective activity of Santalum album is a 
solid proof for the hepatoprotective activity of NKC.
