Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX 75962, USA Abstract: To date, chemical investigations of the genus Camptotheca have been primarily focused on C. acuminata. Total 78 compounds have been isolated from the species, including alkaloids (1-28), ellagic acids (29-40), flavonoids (41-46), sterols (47-48), terpenes (49-55), tannins (56-71), polyphenols and fatty acids (65-72), iridoid (73), lignan (74), polyols (75 and 76), amide (77), and sacchardide (78). The contents of camptothecin (CPT, 1), the major active alkaloid varies significantly with Camptotheca species and varieties, tissue and tree age and seasonal changes. Among all taxa of Camp-totheca, C. acuminata var. acuminata has the lowest CPT contents (0.2249-0.3162% in young leaves, and 0.0392-0.0572% in older leaves). C. lowreyana “Hicksii” has the highest CPT contents in both young and old leaves, approxi-mately 1.5-2 folds higher than those in C. acuminata var. acuminata. Young leaves and mature fruits have high CPT con-tents than other tissues in Camptotheca. In young tissues of C. acuminata var. acuminata, the lowest CPT levels were found in March and April (0.074% and 0.081%, respectively) and highest in June (0.265%).  Keywords: Alkaloids, Camptotheca, Camptothecin variations, Camptothecins (CPTs), Ellagic acids, Flavonoids, sterols, Terpenes. CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS  The report of chemical constituents of Camptotheca has been restricted to C. acuminata. To date, 78 compounds have been isolated from C. acuminata, including alkaloids (1-28), ellagic acids (29-40), flavonoids (41-46), sterols (47-48), terpenes (49-55), tannins (56-71), polyphenols and fatty ac-ids (65-72), iridoid (73), lignan (74), polyols (75 and 76), amide (77), and sacchardide (78) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Alkaloids Camptothecin (CPT, 1), a pyrrolo[3,4-b]-quinoline alkaloid, was first identified from the stem wood of C. acu-minata in 1966 by Dr. Monroe E. Wall and Dr. Mansukh C. Wani of Research Triangle Institute in systematic screening of natural products for anticancer drugs [1]. In 1969, Dr. Wani and Dr. Wall had also first isolated two minor and re-lated components 10-hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT, 2) and 10-methoxycamptothecin (4) by further fractionation of the stem wood of C. acuminata. Compounds 1 and 2 were also found to occur in other plant parts, including leave [2], stem bark [2], fruit [2, 3], and root [2, 4]. Since then C. acu-minata is considered to be a rich plant source of the potent camptothecinoids. This class is characterized by a penta-cyclic ring structure embodying pyrrolo[3,4-b]-quinoline moiety (rings A, B and C), conjugated pyridone moiety (ring D) and a chiral centre within a six membered -hydroxy lac-tone (ring E) [5]. This planar pentacyclic ring structure is thought to be one of the most important factors in inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I. Oxygenation is also usually ob-served at C-10 and C-11 and often at C-18 and C-20.   *Address correspondence to this author at the National Center for Pharma-ceutical Crops, Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture, Stephen F.

So far 10 quinoline camptothecinoids (3, 5-13) have been reported by scientists in the United States, China, and Japan. 10-hydroxy-20-deoxycamptothecin (3) was isolated by Lin and coworkers in 1989 from the fruit  of C. acuminata and possessed a strong cytotoxicity against P388 leukemia cell [6]. Two new camptothecinoids  10-methoxy-20-O-acetylcamptothecin (5) and 20- -D-glucopyranosyl 18-hydroxycamptothecin (13), together 10-methoxycamptothecin (4), 18-hydroxycamptothecin (8),  20-O-acetylcamptothecin (10) and 20-deoxycamptothecin (12) were isolated from root bark and leaf of C. acuminata by Zhang et al. in 2004 [2]. Hsu et al. in 1977 [3], and  Lin et al., in 1978, 1979 and 1982 [7-9] isolated 11-hydroxycamptothecin (6), 11-methoxycamptothecin (7), respectively, together with 10-methoxycamptothecin (4) and 20-deoxycamptothecin (12) from the fruit of C. acumi-nata. 18-hydroxycamptothecin (8) was also found from the fruit of C. acuminata [10]. Two minor camptothecinoids 20-hexanoylcamptothecin (9), 20-hexanoyl-10-methoxyca-mptothecin (11) with one known compound 12 were identi-fied from stem bark of C. acuminata in 1979 [11]. Com-pound 20-deoxycamptothecin (12) was reported as a minor camptothecinoid from the fruit of C. acuminata [12]. 20-formylbenz [6,7] indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline-11 (13H)-one (14), 22-hydroxyacuminatine (15), and 19-hydroxyma- ppicine (18) are three minor quinoline alkaloids isolated from the root of C. acuminata [2] and the fruit of C. acu-minata [13].  Five minor indole alkaloids were reported, including an-gustoline (16) from the stem and the fruit of C. acuminata [15, 16], 19-O-methylangustoline (17) from the fruit of C. acuminata [17], camptacumotine (19), camptacumanine (20), and naucleficine (21) isolated from the fruit of 164    Pharmaceutical Crops, 2014, Volume 5 Li and Wang NNOOR4OR3R1R2NN ORNNCH3OOHOH18NN OOH19OCH3NN OOHH3COCH3O2014 R=CHO15 R=CH2OHNN ONHOR16 R=H17 R=CH3NN OOHOOOHHOOHOHH22NN OOH24OOOHHOOHOHHNNHCOOHOH23OOOHHOOHOHHNN OOH25OOOHHOOHOHHONN OOHCH21NHOCH2OHN26N27CH3OH28N OCOOHHA B CDE1   R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OH2   R1 = OH, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OH3   R1 = OH, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = H4   R1 = OCH3, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OH5   R1 = OCH3, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OAc6   R1 = H, R2 = OH, R3 = CH3, R4 = OH7   R1 = H, R2 = OCH3, R3 = CH3, R4 = OH8   R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = CH2OH, R4 = OH9   R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OCO(CH2)4CH3 10 R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OAc11 R1 = OCH3, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = OCO(CH2)4CH312 R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = CH3, R4 = H13 R1 = H, R2 = H, R3 = CH2OH, R4 = -D-glucopyranosyl OOOOR2OR3OOOR1R429  R1=H, R2=CH3, R3=H, R4=OH30  R1=H, R2=CH3, R3= -D-glucopyranosyl, R4=H31  R1=H, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4=OCH332  R1=H, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4=OH33  R1=OCH3, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4=OCH334  R1=H, R2=H, R3=H, R4=H35  R1=H, R2=CH3, R3=H, R4=H36  R1=H, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4=HOOOOOR3OR4R1OR2O37  R1=CH3, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4=H, R5=H38  R1=CH3, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4= -D-glucopyranosyl, R5=H39  R1=CH3, R2=H, R3=H, R4=CH3, R5=H40  R1=CH3, R2=CH3, R3=CH3, R4=CH3, R5=OCH3OHOOHOR1OR2OH 41 R1=H, R2=OH42 R1= -D-galactopyranosyl, R2=OH43 R1= -D-glucopyranosyl, R2=OH44 R1= -D-galactopyranosyl, R2=H45 R1= -D-glucopyranosyl, R2=H46 R1=H, R2=HRO47 R=H48 R= -D-glucopyranosylR5 Fig. (1) contd….

Compounds isolated from Camptotheca acuminata.  C. acuminata [16]. In additional, four indole alkaloid gly-cosides (22-25) were also identified from C. acuminata, which are related to the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway (Fig 2). Such as, strictosamide (24) isolated from the leave, stem bark, fruit, and root of C. acuminata [2, 18], and pumi-loside (25) from the stem and fruit of C. acuminata [2, 15], might be plausible biogenetic precursors of camptothecin. However, vincosamide (22) [2, 3, 18] and strictosidinic acid (23) [2, 18] are structurally related alkaloids with 24 and 25 (Fig. 2). Three simple alkaloids, dihydrosoquinamine (26) [16], venoterpine (27) [3, 4], 1,2-dihydro-2-oxoquinoline-4-carboxylic acid (28) [18], were also isolated from the fruit and the root of C. acuminata.  Ellagic Acids Ellagic acid is a natural phenol antioxidant found in  numerous fruits and vegetables. Its antiproliferative and  antioxidant properties have showed potential health benefits. There are 12 ellagic acids (29-40) reported from various parts of C. acuminata. Most ellagic acid were identified  from the fruits, including 3, 4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O- -D-glucopyranosylellagic acid (30) [18], 3, 4-methyle- nedioxy-3', 4'-O-dimethyl-5'-methoxyellagic acid (31), 3, 4-methylenedioxy-3', 4'-O-dimethyl-5'-hydroxyellagic acid (32), 3, 4-O,O-methyleneellagic acid (34), 3'-O-methyl-3,4-O,O-methyleneellagic acid (35), 3',4'-O-dimethyl-3,4-O,O-methyleneellagic acid (36), 3, 3', 4-O-trimethylellagic acid (37), 3, 4'-O-dimethylellagic acid (39), and 3,3',4, 4'-O-tetramethyl-5'-methoxyellagic acid (40) [8, 19]. Compound 38, 3,3',4-O-trimethyl-4'-O- -D-glucopyranosylellagic acid, was isolated from the root and stem bark [2]. 3, 4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-5'-hydroxyellagic acid (29) was identified from the root of C. acuminata [2]. 3, 4-methylenedioxy-3', 4'-O-dimethyl-5, 5'-dimethoxylellagic acid (33) was found from the leave of C. acuminata [2]. Com-pounds 30, 31, and 37 were also reported from the root, leave or stem bark of C. acuminata [2, 4].  Flavonoids Six flavonoids were reported, so far, from the leave of C. acuminata [2, 20] and the stem bark of C. acuminata [2]. It can be observed that four flavonol glycosides, including hyperoside (42), isoquercitrin (43), trifolin (44), and astragalin (45), are quercetin (41) and kaempferol (46) derivatives.  Sterols Although the sterols are widely distributed in plant, there are only -sitosterol (47) and its glycoside (48) isolated from the fruit of C. acuminata [9] and the root of C. acuminata  [4, 21].  Terpenes There are five pentacyclic triterpenes (49-53) were iso-lated from the fruit of C. acuminata (49 and 53) [3, 22] and Phytochemistry of Camptotheca Decaisne Pharmaceutical Crops, 2014, Volume 5    167 Table 1.

Amyrin (50), 2,3-dihydroxy-12-ursen-28-oic acid (51), and bassic acid (52) were identified by Dr. Li’ research team [Supporting Data]. One monoterpene (strychnolactone, 54) [10], and one ses-quiterpene (abscisic acid 55) [9] were also reported from the fruit of C. acuminata. Tannins From the leaf of C. acuminata, camptothin A (56) and camptothin B (57) were isolated along with cornusiin A (58), gemin D (59), tellimagrandin II (60), tellimagrandin I (61), 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl- -D-glucose (62), and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl- -D-glucose (63) [23]. Pedunculagin (64) was iso-lated from the fruit of C. acuminata [23]. Polyphenols and Fatty Acids Seven aromatic compounds (65-71) and one long chain fatty acid (72) were isolated from C. acuminata. Loganic acid (65) [18], chlorogenic acid (66) [18], 1-caffeoylquinic acid (67) [18], syringic acid (69) [19], salicylic acid (70) [10] , ethyl caffeate (71) [22], and nonandioic acid (72) [10] were isolated or identified from fruits. Gallic acid (68) was iso-lated from the leaves [23].  Miscellaneous Compounds Five other classes of compounds (73-78) were found from C. acuminata. Two polyols (75 and 76) [18, 22], one iridoid (73) [18], one lignan (74) [9], one amide (77) [18] were isolated from the fruit of C. acuminata. Compound 78 was identified from the stem bark of C. acuminata [2]. VARIATIONS OF CPT CONTENTS Presently, the bioactive nature of secondary metabolites in plants, such as alkaloids, phenolics and terpenoids has made them medicinally important. CPT is the most well-known example, which has shown a broad range of antican-cer activity in animal models and continued to serve as a very attractive and challenging lead structure for the devel-opment of new anticancer drugs. To data, the extraction from C. acuminata is still considered as the main approach to ob-tain CPT compared with total synthesis. It becomes very important to understand content variations of CPT within and among plants, and with time. This review has also fo-cused on presenting CPT variation among Camptotheca spe-cies and varieties, tissue and tree age, seasonal changes, and providing useful information for maximum yield of CPT and the discovery of novel camptothecinoids.  170    Pharmaceutical Crops, 2014, Volume 5 Li and Wang  Fig. (2). Hypothetical biogenetic pathway of camptothecin (CPT) (1).  CPT Variations Among Species and Varieties Among all Camptotheca taxa, C. acuminata var. acumi-nata has the lowest CPT contents, from a maximum of 0.3162% to minimum of 0.2249% in young leaves, and from a maximum of 0.0572% to minimum of 0.0392% in older leaves. C. lowreyana “Hicksii” has the highest CPT contents in both young and old leaves, approximately 1.5-2 folds higher than those in C. acuminata var. acuminata (Table 2). C. lowreyana var. lowreyana, C. yunnanensis, and C. acumi-nata var. tenuifolia have not showed significant variation in young leaf CPT contents. C. lowreyana “Hicksii” and “Ka-tie” was considered as the major management germplasm for CPT source by showing desirable features in both biomass and CPT concentration [24].  CPT Variations within Plants These was evidenced early in 1977 that the CPT contents vary significantly within different tissues, although all parts of the C. acuminata plant contain some CPT (Table 3) [3, 4]. In our previous studies, the highest concentrations of CPT were found in the young leaves and mature fruit [24]. Young leaves (< 1 weeks old) contained a mean CPT concentration of 0.2313%, which was 26-fold higher than that in young root (<4 weeks old), followed by young fruits (< 1 weeks old) and young stems (<4 weeks old) with a mean CPT con-centration of 0.0842% and 0.0718% of dry weight, respec-tively. For old tissues, CPT content in fruit was 12-fold, 6-fold, and 4-fold higher than in stems, roots, and leaves, re-spectively.

The authors described also CPT variations in the young leaves (0.011%-0.0432%) and very young roots (0.015-0.025%). Pi et al. investigated the con-tents of CPT and 10-HCPT in different tissues including roots, stems, leaves, young flower buds, opening flowers, fading flowers and seeds from C. acuminata [26]. The young flower buds had also found having the highest alkaloid concentrations with a mean CPT concentration of 0.246% and 10-HCPT of 0.141% of dry weight.  Of particular interest was the finding that CPT content is obviously related to tissue age rather than its location on the plant and tree age [24]. Against this background, although no detailed descriptions about leaf materials were given, it is likely that young tissue was used in the CPT analysis in some previous studies [1, 20, 27-30], while some negative results may had been caused by the use of relatively old tis-sue in the analyses [26, 28, 31, 32]. So, in conclusion, only fruits and young leaves of Camptotheca are currently suit-able for CPT extract.  CPT Variations with Seasons There was significant seasonal variation in CPT concen-tration in C. acuminata var. acuminata over the course of the growing season. Liu et al. found a steady decline of 11% per month in leaf CPT concentration from a maximum of 0.051% in April to a minimum of 0.017% in October. Branches showed a similar seasonal decline in CPT concen-tration to leaves from a maximum of 0.018% in April to a minimum of 0.011% in October. However, the rate of de-cline was threefold greater in leaves than in branches [28]. Our research results are very different from these statements [24]. In intact young tissues, significant seasonal change were showed with the lowest CPT contents in March and April (0.074% and 0.081%, respectively) and highest in June (0.265%) in C. acuminata var. acuminata, and no significant difference among May and July to October (0.117-0.171%). It was reported that CPT contents in mature fruits (usually in September to October) are 2-3 times of those in young fruits or flowers (in May to June). In additional, the seasonal changes of CPT in intact young tissues and fruits have con-172    Pharmaceutical Crops, 2014, Volume 5 Li and Wang firmed indirectly the studies on CPT variations with tissue age.
