Belonging to the Fabaceae family, P. corylifolia is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including China, South Africa, and extensively across the Indian subcontinent—namely Maharashtra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Bihar, and the Deccan plateau. In the Unani system, different parts of the plant are used therapeutically: roots for dental caries; leaves for diarrhoea; fruits for conditions such as anaemia, asthma, bronchitis, dysuria, inflammation, and vomiting; and seeds for skin conditions like scabies, ulcers, vitiligo, leucoderma, eczema, leprosy, and psoriasis. Phytochemical investigations have revealed more than seventy bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, coumarins, Quinone’s, phenols, benzofurans, benzopyrans, sesquiterpenoids, triterpenes, and steroids. Various pharmacological activities have been reported, such as anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, hemostatic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-obesity, antiviral, anti-mutagenic, anti-filarial, estrogenic, anticancer, anti-asthmatic, anti-diabetic, anti-aging, and immunomodulatory properties. Additionally, potential therapeutic effects have been observed in Alzheimer’s disease and alopecia areata. Several traditional and proprietary Unani formulations such as Roghan Babchi, Sufoof-e-Babchi, Zimad-e-Bars, Habb-e-Bars, and Habb-e-Hindi are commercially available for therapeutic use. This review aims to consolidate classical Ethnomedicinal knowledge and recent pharmacological research on P. corylifolia to facilitate its broader integration into evidence-based phytomedicine. Keywords. Psoralea corylifolia, Babchi, Dermatological disorders, Unani medicine.  Introduction: The Unani system of medicine is one of the oldest traditional healthcare systems, with centuries of practice in the prevention and treatment of various ailments. It is founded upon the theory of maintaining homeostasis through the balance of four humours (akhlāṭ)—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile—and the individual temperament (mizāj), regulated by six essential factors (asbāb-e-sittah ẓarūriyya)1. Disease management involves a combination of regimental therapy (ilāj bi’l-tadbīr), dietary therapy (ilāj bi’l-ghidhāʾ), and pharmacotherapy (ilāj bi’l-dawāʾ)2,3. Plant-derived drugs form the backbone of Unani pharmacopeia, followed by drugs of animal and mineral origin 2,3. Numerous clinical studies have confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of Unani medicines with minimal adverse effects. In recent years, standardization, quality control, and toxicological profiling of many herbal drugs have been carried out, and several formulations have been incorporated into the official Unani Pharmacopoeia of India.2 Psoralea corylifolia L. (Babchi) is a prominently used medicinal herb across Indian traditional systems, including Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha. Native to Asia and Africa, the plant has been historically used to treat various dermatological disorders such as vitiligo, leucoderma, eczema, and leprosy4,5. Phytochemically, the plant is rich in bioactive constituents, particularly psoralen, bakuchiol, isopsoralen, angelicin, along with several flavonoids and coumarins6,7. Among them, psoralen—a linear furanocoumarin—has been widely investigated for its photosensitizing effects and its role in PUVA (Psoralen + UVA) therapy for conditions like vitiligo and psoriasis8. Abudullah et al.                                                                                                                          Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2025; 15(8):259-266 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                           [260]                                                                                            CODEN (USA): JDDTAO The seeds are the most commonly used part and demonstrate a broad spectrum of bioactivities including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and estrogenic effects, making the plant a promising candidate for future drug development9,10. However, despite its widespread traditional use, scientific validation, safety profiling, and standardization remain critical challenges due to variations in active constituents across geographical and processing conditions. Thus, this review integrates insights from classical Unani texts and contemporary scientific research, highlighting the pharmacological relevance and therapeutic potential of P. corylifolia. Materials and Methods A comprehensive survey of classical Unani literature was undertaken to collect information on the temperament (mizāj), medicinal attributes, and therapeutic applications of P. corylifolia. Primary sources included authoritative Unani texts, such as: • Al-Jāmiʿ al-Mufradāt al-Adwiya wa’l-Aghziya by Ibn al-Baitar (1197–1248 AD) • Muḥīt-e-Aʿẓam by Ḥakīm Muḥammad Aʿẓam Khān (1806–1902 AD) • Khazāʾin al-Adwiya by Najm al-Ghani (19th century) • Al-Mukhtārāt fī al-Ṭibb by Ibn Hubal Baghdādī (1122–1213 AD) • Tazkira Ūlū al-Albāb by Dāwūd al-Antākī (1541–1599 AD) • Tuhfat al-Muʾminīn by Ḥakīm Muʾmin Tūnkabūnī (1669 AD) Where needed, authentic Urdu and Persian translations of these classical texts were referred to. Additionally, scientific databases including PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed research articles related to the Phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of P. corylifolia. Relevant studies were selected based on keywords such as “Psoralea corylifolia, Phytochemistry, pharmacology, Unani medicine and vitiligo, coumarins, bakuchiol, and PUVA therapy.” The Unani technical terminology used in this review was standardized using the official publication Standard Unani Medical Terminology by the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) in collaboration with the World Health Organization.

Temperament (Mizāj) In Unani medicine, the concept of temperament (mizāj) is foundational to drug classification and action. Drugs are categorized by their qualitative attributes—hot, cold, moist, or dry—based on their physiological effects. The temperament of Babchi is classified as hot in the second degree and dry in the second degree (Hār Yābis Darajah Sānī) 11,13,15,16,20,22. Detoxification (Tanqiya) ➢ Detoxification is recommended prior to therapeutic use of Babchi. According to Unani texts, seeds should be soaked in ginger water (Āb-e-Adrak) for seven Abudullah et al.

The urine is replenished daily for 21 days. Once complete, the seed peel is removed, and the seeds are dried in the shade16. Dose (Miqdār-e-Khurāk): The recommended dosage for Babchi varies based on the formulation and intended use: • Powdered seeds (Sufoof): 3.5–10.5 māsha11, 3–5 g12, ,1–3 māsha15 • Seed infusion (Zulāl): 1.25 tola11,16 Mode of Administration (Tarkīb-e-Ist͟imālāt): Babchi is administered both orally and topically. Oral preparations include powders and infusions, while external applications include paste (Zamād) and ointment (Marham) 11,18. Adverse Effects (Muzirrāt): Unani texts mention certain adverse effects associated with Babchi, including aggravation of bile and potential induction of tuberculosis and flatulence (Naffākh)11,15. Correctives (Muṣliḥāt): To mitigate adverse effects, correctives such as Sikanjabin, curds, and oil-based preparations (Raughaniyāt) are traditionally co-administered11,12,15. Substitute (Badal): In case of unavailability, Tukhm-e-Panwar is recommended as a suitable substitute for Babchi 11.12.15. Pharmacological Actions (Af‘āl): Psoralea corylifolia is documented with a broad range of pharmacological actions in Unani medicine (Table 2). Table 2.

The fruit (seed) consists of a sticky oily pericarp; a hard seed coat and kernel12,30 .   (b) Microscopic: Transverse section of fruit shows pericarp with prominent ridges and depressions, consisting of collapsed parenchyma and large secretory glands containing oleo-resinous matter; testa, an outer layer for palisade epidermis, layer of bearer cells which are much thickened in the inner tangential and basal radial walls and 2-3 layers of parenchyma; cotyledons of polyhedral parenchyma and three layers of palisade cells on the adaxial side12.  The fruit of Psoralea is perennial. The fruit cannot survive in freezing weather. The arrangement of the leaves is racemes. The simple leaves are broad, elliptic, having margins with dents. The color of the flowers when it blooms during rain are purple with blue tints13. The crop gets fully mature in 7–8 months. The seeds take time to mature, and therefore collection can be rendered 4–5 times from December to March34. Phytochemistry: The seeds of Psoralea corylifolia contain a wide array of phytoconstituents, including an essential oil (0.05%), a non-volatile terpenoid oil, a dark brown resin (8.6%), a brown fixed oil (10%), and a pigment identified as hydroxyflavone. Additionally, the seeds yield a monoterpenoid phenol known as bakuchiol, as well as raffinose and various coumarin compounds such as psoralidin, psoralen, isopsoralidin, isopsoralen, and corylifolin. Other constituents include albumin, sugar, 7.5% ash content, and traces of manganese18,19,20,35. Among the therapeutically active components, psoralen and isopsoralen have been particularly noted13. Upon storage, the fixed oil deposits psoralen, which contains approximately 21.5% resin acid. The unsaponifiable fraction of the oil contains stigmasterol. Both the essential oil and unsaponified oil exhibit pharmacological activity and are utilized in the treatment of dermatological conditions, particularly leucoderma and psoriasis20,35. Biological and Pharmacological Activities Antibacterial Activity: The antibacterial potential of P. corylifolia has been demonstrated against a broad spectrum of pathogens48. Seed extracts rich in bakuchiol inhibit Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and β-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus. Psoralidin and bakuchicin show efficacy against Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri, while psoralen and angelicin inhibit S. aureus. Bakuchi-based formulations (ointments, oils, and mouth rinses) have shown inhibitory effects against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Bakuchi mouth rinses suppress S. mutans at low concentrations and impact human gingival fibroblasts. Antifungal Activity: Bakuchiol, a phenolic compound extracted from the seeds, exhibits strong antifungal activity against several pathogenic strains including Microsporum gypseum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton rubrum, and T. mentagrophytes at approximately 250 μg/ml49. Antiviral Activity: The crude ethanol extract of P. corylifolia seeds exhibits potent antiviral activity against the papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV, with an IC₅₀ value of 15 μg/ml. This protease is essential for the replication of the SARS virus41. Antiprotozoal Activity: The methanolic extract of P. corylifolia exhibited marked efficacy against the external protozoan parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in freshwater fish. At 5.00 mg/L, the extract resulted in 100% mortality of protomonts and 88.9% of encysted tomonts53. Anthelmintic Activity: Clinical evaluations have confirmed the anti-helminthic properties of P. corylifolia seeds against both roundworms and flatworms50. Anti-leucoderma Activity: Psoralen, a key compound isolated from P. corylifolia, induces melanogenesis and has been employed effectively in the treatment of leucoderma37. Anti-psoriatic Activity: The plant has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in the management of psoriasis38. Anti-inflammatory Activity: The chloroform extract of the seeds, at a dose of 400 mg/kg, exhibited significant activity in models of Abudullah et al.                                                                                                                          Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2025; 15(8):259-266 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                           [264]                                                                                            CODEN (USA): JDDTAO carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and mouse ear inflammation39. Three isoflavone derivatives—7-O-methylcorylifol A, 7-O-isoprenylcorylifol A, and 7-O-isoprenylneobavaisoflavone—were isolated from the fruits and shown to possess anti-inflammatory effects40.Neobavaisoflavone, a flavonoid found in the plant, significantly inhibited ROS and RNS production, and the expression of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, TNF-α) in LPS+IFN-γ or PMA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages41. Antioxidant Activity: Tannins and flavonoids in P. corylifolia act as natural antioxidants, helping prevent β-cell damage and oxidative stress in diabetes38. Anti-acne Activity: Bakuchiol and other phenolic compounds in the plant exhibit anti-acne activity. Bakuchiol has been shown to be safe, non-irritating, and non-sensitizing, making it suitable for prolonged application43. Anti-eczema Activity: In an open-label clinical study, a cream formulated from hexane-extracted seed oil showed promising results in 30 patients with eczema over 30 days44. Anticancer Activity: Leaves of P. corylifolia contain more than 2 g/kg of genistein. Furocoumarins such as psoralen and isopsoralen induced apoptosis in carcinoma cell lines KB, KBv200, K562, and K562/ADM, with IC₅₀ values for isopsoralen at 61.9–72.0 µg/ml and psoralen at 24.4–88.1 µg/ml45. Bakuchiol demonstrated selective apoptosis in hepatic stellate cells, indicating potential against liver cancer46,47. Hepatoprotective Activity: In Hep G2 cells, bakuchiol and related compounds exhibited hepatoprotective effects against tacrine-induced cytotoxicity51. Anti-diabetic Activity: Aqueous seed extract improved fasting glucose levels, antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, peroxidase, SOD), and reduced lipid peroxidation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at a dose of 20 mg/0.5 ml/100 g body weight52. Immunomodulatory Activity: The seed extract of P. corylifolia enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activity and modulated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in murine models54 Discussion: Babchi (Psoralea corylifolia) is regarded as a valuable medicinal plant in Unani medicine, possessing multiple pharmacological actions such as antioxidant, anti-dermatotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Both the crude drug and its active constituents have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic potential across various disease conditions. Numerous compound formulations containing Babchi are currently available in the market for clinical use. The primary action of Babchi on the skin is attributed to its bitter taste and pungent post-digestive effect, which help pacify the Safravi and Balghami humours. It also plays a significant role in Tazkiyah-e-Dam (blood purification), making it effective in the treatment of dermatological disorders. Conclusion: P. corylifolia, commonly known as Babchi, is a distinguished medicinal drug recognized since antiquity, with references found across multiple traditional systems of medicine. In the Unani tradition, its properties (Mizaj, Af‘āl) and therapeutic applications have been extensively described in classical treatises. Unani scholars also acknowledge its potent action, particularly in dermatological ailments. Over seventy phytoconstituents have been identified from various parts of the plant, many of which possess notable pharmacological activities. Babchi   is revered as a classical remedy for cutaneous disorders and has been traditionally indicated in conditions such as Bars (leukoderma), Bahq (vitiligo), Juzām (leprosy), and other chronic skin ailments. In recent decades, modern pharmacological studies have further validated its therapeutic actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. Several Unani formulations containing Babchi are commercially available, such as Roghan Babchi, Sufoof-e-eBabchi, Zimad-e-Bars and Habb-e-Bars, are utilized in the management of various diseases. This review comprehensively highlights the Ethnomedicinal significance, phytochemical constituents, and pharmacological profile of P. corylifolia, underscoring its value as a classical drug with modern therapeutic relevance.
