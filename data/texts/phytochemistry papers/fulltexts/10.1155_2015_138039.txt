Guggulu is an oleo-gum resin which exudes out as a result of injury from the bark of Commiphora wightii (Arnott) Bhandari
[syn. Commiphoramukul (Hook. Ex Stocks) Engl;Balsamodendronmukul (Hook. Ex Stocks); Family, Burseraceae]. It has been used
in the Ayurveda since time immemorial for the treatment of variety of disorders such as inflammation, gout, rheumatism, obesity,
and disorders of lipids metabolism. It is a mixture of phytoconstituents like volatile oil which contains terpenoidal constituents
such as monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids; steroids; flavonoids; guggultetrols; lignans; sugars; and
amino acids.This review is an effort to compile all the information available on all of its chemical constituents which are responsible
for its therapeutic potential.Thewild occurrence of this species is restrictedmainly to the dry regions of Rajasthan andGujarat States
of India, and the bordering regions of Pakistan. Oleo-gum resin, guggulu, tapped from the stems of this species, is consumed in
high volumes by the Indian herbal industries.There has been a decline in its wild population over the last several decades, as a result
of habitat loss and degradation, coupled with unregulated harvesting and tapping of oleo-gum resin. This species is consequently
assessed as Critically Endangered and enlisted in the IUCN red list of threatened species.
1. Introduction
Guggulu consists of oleo-gum resin obtained as an exudate
from the tapping of stem and branches of Commiphora
wightii (Arnott) Bhandari [syn. Commiphora mukul (Hook.
Ex Stocks) Engl; Balsamodendron mukul (Hook. Ex Stocks);
Family, Burseraceae]. The plant is commonly known as
guggul tree and is found in arid areas of India, Bangladesh,
and Pakistan. In India, it is found in Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Assam, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka. It is a small, bushy
treewith thorny branches and produces a yellowish gum resin
(guggulu) in small ducts located throughout its bark. The
trees are tapped bymaking an incision on the bark.The resin,
which flows out, is allowed to harden before it is collected.
The tree is tapped fromNovember to January and the resin is
collected through May to June. A guggul tree yields between
250 to 500 g of dry resin during each collection season [1, 2].
In Indian traditional system of medicine, guggulu has
been used for thousands of years in the treatment of arthritis,
inflammation, gout, rheumatism, obesity, and disorders of
lipids metabolism [3]. It is known by different names like
guggula, guggul, guggal, gugar, and Indian bdellium [4].
Guggulu occurs in vermicular pieces of pale yellow
or brown coloured mass with aromatic odour and bitter
astringent taste; when fresh it is viscid and golden coloured.
It should produce not more than 5 percent of total ash and 1
percent of acid-insoluble ash. It yields not less than 27 percent
of alcohol-soluble matter and not less than 53 percent of
water-solublematter.Thegenuine samples of guggulu contain
1 percent of volatile oil [2] and between 1.0 and 1.5 percent of
guggulsterones (𝑍 and 𝐸) [3].
Guggulu Shodhana (shodhan vidhi). It has been mentioned in
Ayurvedic texts that administration of raw guggulu may lead
to skin rashes, irregular menstruation, diarrhoea, headache,
mild nausea, and, with very high doses, liver toxicity [5].
In order to overcome unwanted effects of raw guggulu,
Ayurveda describes a number of purification processes
(shodhan vidhi) using different fluids (dravyas), which not
only take care of the adverse effects but also enhance the
therapeutic activity. According to Ayurvedic texts, guggulu
must be purified before incorporating into formulations [1].
During a process of shodhan, guggulu is treated with specific
materials of biological origin, for example, herbal juices, cow

urine, and cowmilk. It is possible that some of the properties
(chemical and biological) of shodhan materials are added to
guggulu during the purification process. It is also possible that
some of the toxic or harmful constituents of raw guggulu are
neutralized, detoxified, or removed during this process.
There are a large number of commercial polyherbal anti-
inflammatory formulations which are using guggulu as the
chief ingredient [6]. However, no study has been done to
investigate the process of Ayurvedic purification and its
probable effect on therapeutic efficacy except for one report
which states that gastric irritancy of guggulu is reduced with
purification [7].
During the process of purification, foreign matter is
removed from raw guggulu manually and is then broken
into small pieces. The broken mass is wrapped in a piece of
cloth (called potli) and hanged into an inert container (called
dola yantra) containing one of the recommended media
which are gomutra (cow urine), triphala kasaya (decoction
of triphala), vasapatra kasaya (decoction of Adhatoda vasica
leaves), vasapatra savrasa (aqueous extract ofAdhatoda vasica
leaves), dugdha (milk), and water. The guggulu is kept
immersed, while fluid is boiled till all the soluble matter of
guggulu is dissolved in the purifying vehicle. The insoluble
part of guggulu is taken out and discarded. Further boiling is
continued till guggulu solution forms a soft mass. It is then
poured out over a smooth wooden board smeared with cow
ghee or castor oil anddried in the sun.Thedriedmass is called
purified guggulu (suddh guggulu) [1].
2. Phytoconstituents of Guggulu
Guggulu contains diterpenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, long-
chain aliphatic tetrols, aliphatic esters, ferulates, lignans,
carbohydrates, and a variety of inorganic ions besides minor
amounts of sesamin and other unidentified constituents.
2.1. Volatile Oil and Its Terpenoidal Constituents
2.1.1. Monoterpenoids. The gum resin of C. wightii yields
about 0.4% of essential oil by steam distillation and its chief
components are myrcene, dimyrcene, and polymyrcene [8].
Other components of the oil are eugenol, d-limonene, 𝛼-
pinene, (±) linalool, cineole, 𝛼-terpineol, d-𝛼-phellandrene,
methylheptanone, bornyl acetate, (±) geraniol, and some
other unidentified compounds [9].

2.1.2. Sesquiterpenoids. The gum resin of C. wightii has been
reported to contain bicyclic sesquiterpene, cadinene [9].
2.1.3. Diterpenoids. Diterpenoid constituents from guggulu
include 𝛼-camphorene (1) (Figure 1) [10], cembrene-A (2)
(Figure 1), cembrene (3) (Figure 2) [10], and other cem-
brenoids. Cembrene-A is one of themost elementary tetraen-
es derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by C-1 to C-14
cyclization.
Mukulol (allylcembrol) (4) (Figure 2) is a new cembrane
alcohol which was isolated from the aerial parts and also
from the resin of guggulu [11, 12]. The allylcembrol structure
was established by spectral analysis and mild dehydration
which yielded cembrene. Other isolated cembrane type
diterpenes include isocembrol (5) (Figure 3) and 4-
epiisocembrol (6) (Figure 3). (1𝐸, 4𝐸, 8𝐸)-4,8,14-Trimethyl-
11-(1-methylethyl)4-methoxycyclotertradeca-1,4,8-triene (7)

and (4𝑍, 6𝐸)-4,7,12,15,15-pentamethylbicylco [9.3.1] pentade-
ca-4,6-diene-12-ol (9) (Figure 4) were novel compounds
obtained by bioassay-guided isolation from hexane-soluble
portion of the methanol extract of guggulu [13].
2.1.4. Triterpenoids. Polypodane-type triperpenes, myrrhan-
ol A (10) (Figure 5), B (11) (Figure 5), and C (12) (Figure 5),
myrrhanone A (13) (Figure 6), myrrhanone B (14) (Figure 6)

have been isolated from the gum resin [16]. The isolation
of two more triterpenoidal components has been reported,
which are identified as mansumbinone (19) (Figure 9) and
mansumbinoic acid (20) (Figure 9) [17].
The absolute stereostructure of myrrhanol A was deter-
mined to be (3𝑆, 5𝑆, 8𝑅, 9𝑅, 10𝑆)-3,8,30-trihydroxypolypo-
da-13𝐸, 17𝐸, 21𝐸-triene. Myrrhanol B is 30-oic acid of
myrrhanol A with altered stereostructure at C-5 (5𝑅 in
contrast to 5𝑆 in myrrhanol A). Myrrhanone A and B are
3-keto analogue of myrrhanol A and B, respectively [15].

(22) (Figure 10), have also been isolated [13].
2.2. Steroids. Isolation of several steroidal constituents has
been reported from the gum resin. The major constituents
include E-guggulsterone (23) (Figure 11), Z-guggulsterone
(24) (Figure 11), guggulsterol-1 (25) (Figure 12), guggulsterol-
II (26) (Figure 12), guggulsterol-III (27) (Figure 12) [18],
guggulsterol-IV (28) (Figure 13), guggulsterol-V (29)

Other isolated steroids are 20𝛼-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one
(31) (Figure 13), 20𝛽-hydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, and 16𝛽-
hydroxy-4,17(20)-Z-pregnadien-3-one, which has been
designated as Z-guggulsterol [20]. Progesterone and related
steroids, 4-pregnene-3,16-dione (32) (Figure 13), (20R)-
20-acetoxy-4-pregnene-3,16-dione,16𝛽-acetyloxypregn-
4,17(20)-trans-diene-3-one (33) (Figure 14), 3𝛼-acetyloxy-
5𝛼-pregnan-16-one (34) (Figure 14), and 20R,22R-dihydrox-
ycholest-4-en-3-one (35) (Figure 14), have also been isolated
[16]. Cholesterol has also been reported. Three new and
recently isolated steroids are guggulsterone-M, dihydro
guggulsterone-M (36) (Figure 14), and guggulsterol-Y (37)
(Figure 14) [17]. The steroidal constituents have been related
with hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities of the
drug [13].
2.3. Flavonoids. An ethanolic extract of trunk of C. wightii
was separated on column packed with silica gel to give a new
antifungal flavone named muscanone (38) (Figure 15) along
with known naringenin. Muscanone was found to be active
against Candida albicans in microbial sensitive assay [21].
The major flavonoid components of the flowers of
C. mukul were identified as quercetin (39) (Figure 16),
quercetin-3-O-𝛼-L-arabinose (40) (Figure 17), quercetin-
3-O-𝛽-D-glucuronide (41) (Figure 17), quercetin-3-O-𝛽-D-
galactoside (42) (Figure 17), quercetin-3-O-𝛼-L-rhamnoside
(43) (Figure 17), and pelargonidin-3,5,di-O-glucoside (44)
(Figure 17) [22].
2.4. Guggultetrols. A crystalline material was isolated from
the saponified gum resin which was characterized as a mix-
ture of octadecan-1,2,3,4-tetrol (45) (Figure 18), nonadecan-
1,2,3,4-tetrol (46) (Figure 18), and eicosan-1,2,3,4-tetrol (47)
(Figure 18)withminor amount of other components, possibly
lower (C-16 and C-17) and higher (C-21 and C-22) homol-
ogous tetrols. These compounds constitute a new class of
naturally occurring lipids, guggultetrols. They are long-chain
linear aliphatic tetrols with hydroxyl functions at C-1, C-2, C-
3, and C-4 positions. Through derivatization and preparative
GLC, guggultetrol-18 (48) (Figure 18) and guggultetrol-20
(49) (Figure 18) were obtained in pure form [23].
A mixture of two ferulates (𝑛 = 16, 17) (50) (Figure 19)
with an unusual skeleton was found to be responsible for the
cytotoxic action of the drug. They have been isolated from
cytotoxic fraction of ethyl acetate extract of guggulu. It was
identified as a mixture of esters based on homologous long-
chain tetrols and acid [24].
2.5. Lignans. Two lignans, sesamin [18] and diayangambin
(51) (Figure 20) [25], have been reported from guggulu.
Also, 5,5󸀠-tetrahydro-1𝐻,3𝐻-furo[3,4-c]furan-1,4-diylbis[7-
(methoxy)-1,3-benzodioxole] (52) (Figure 20) has been
reported from methanolic extract of guggulu [13].
2.6. Sugars. Complete hydrolysis of gum part of resin
yielded L-arabinose, D-galactose, L-fructose (traces), and
4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid. Graded hydrolysis of the
gum furnished an aldobiouronic acid [6-O-(4-O-methyl-𝛽-
D-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-D-galactose] [26]. Hydroly-
sis of methylated gum furnished 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-D-
galactose, 2,3-di-O-methyl-L-arabinose, 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-
D-galactose, 2,4-di-O-methyl-D-galactose, and 2,3,4-tri-O-
methyl-D-glucuronic acid in the ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1. The
provisional structure showed the gum to be a highly branched
polysaccharide containing 1–6, 1–3, and 1–5 type of linkage
[27].
2.7. Amino Acids. C. mukul was extracted with alcohol and
the extract after removal of the solvent was partitioned
between water and ether. The aqueous fraction was chro-
matographed and it showed the presence of various amino
acids.The amino acids detectedwere cystine, histidine, lysine,
arginine, aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, threonine,
alanine, proline, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine, and
isoleucine [28].
3. Traditional Uses of Guggulu
Guggulu has a long history of use in Ayurveda. The Athar-
vaveda is the earliest reference containing its medicinal and
therapeutic properties [29]. Detailed description regarding
its actions, uses, and indications and the varieties of guggul
have been described in numerous Ayurvedic treatises includ-
ing Charaka Samhita (1000 B.C.), Sushruta Samhita (600
B.C.) and Vagbhata (7th century A.D.). In addition, various
medical lesions were written between the 12th and 14th
centuries A.D. [30]. Guggulu has been used to treat obesity,
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, facial paralysis,
sciatica, constipation, haemorrhoids, liver disorders, inflam-
mation, cyst, cervical lymphadenitis, coronary thrombosis,
anaemia, diabetes, urinary calculus, increased frequency and
turbidity of urine, and skin diseases [31, 32].

It has a wide range of usefulness in indigenous medicine.
It is astringent and antiseptic and acts as a bitter, stomachic,
and carminative when taken internally. Like all oleo resins,
it causes increase in number of leucocytes and stimulates
phagocytosis. It acts as a diaphoretic, expectorant, diuretic,
uterine stimulant, and emmenagogue. The resin is used
in the form of lotion for indolent ulcers and as a gargle
in caries, spongy gums, pyorrhea, chronic tonsillitis, and
ulcerated throat. Inhalation of the fumes from burnt guggulu
is recommended in hay fever, acute and chronic nasal catarrh,
chronic laryngitis, chronic bronchitis, and phthisis. It is an
ingredient of ointment for ulcers [2].

4. Pharmacological Activity of Guggulu
4.1. Hypolipidemic Activity. The lipid lowering effect of gug-
gulu with special reference to atherosclerosis and obesity
(medoraga) was first reported in a doctorate thesis submitted
to the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in January 1966.
Earlier to this work, guggulu was well known as an Ayurvedic
drug for the treatment of various types of arthritis. This
work was inspired by a rather obscure shloka in Sanskrit
in the well-known Ayurvedic treatise Sushruta Samhita. The
shloka deals in an extraordinarily lucid and scientificmanner,
with the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of obesity
and associated lipid disorders and their complications. The

hypolipidemic activity was shown in animals as well as in
patients of obesity and hypercholesterolemia [33].
In carefully planned studies carried out (over a period of
two years) on rabbits, in which hyperlipidemia was induced
by feeding cholesterol (in hydrogenated vegetable oil), it
was demonstrated for the very first time that crude guggulu
could not only lower significantly the serum cholesterol in
hypercholesterolemic rabbits but also protected these animals
against cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis at the fatty streak
stage. It also reduced the body weight of the animals. A
similar trend to reduce significantly the serum cholesterol
levels in patients with obesity and hypercholesterolemia was
found in clinical studies with crude guggulu. The Central
Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow, has been engaged
in chemical, pharmacological, and clinical studies on guggulu
[33].
Gugulipid, an ethyl acetate extract of the oleoresin,
standardized at CDRI, has been marketed in India since 1988
as a hypolipidemic agent. It contains 𝑍-guggulsterones and
𝐸-guggulsterones which are purported to be the compounds
responsible for the hypolipidemic activity of the guggulu [34,
35]. Gugulipid contains not less than 4 percent and not more
than 6 percent of guggulsterones (𝑍and 𝐸). The decision to
use the ethyl acetate extract rather than two guggulsterones
was primarily for commercial reasons and was also because
of the fact that other components of the ethyl acetate extract
showed synergistic (hypolipidemic) effect [33]. A number of
clinical studies were carried out to confirm hypolipidemic
activity of guggulu and gugulipid [36, 37]. The findings of
multicentric clinical trials carried out with gugulipid at seven
different centres in India coordinated in collaboration with
CDRI confirmed the role of gugulipid as a hypolipidemic
agent [36].
The hypolipidemic activity of guggulu and its various
fractions has been studied in several animal models and
clinical studies [1]. Initial studies reported that crude guggulu

has encouraging hypolipidemic activity in rabbits [38]. This
activity was also confirmed in other animals including white
leghorn chicks, domestic pig, Presbytis monkey, and albino
rat [1].
Studies were also conducted on the petroleum ether
fraction (A), alkali washed neutral portion (B), and petrol-
insoluble fraction (C) in healthy 8-week-old male white
leghorn chicks in which hypercholesterolemia was induced
by atherogenic diet fed for 2-3 weeks. All the fractions
were found to lower the serum cholesterol, with fraction
A being the most potent and fraction B being the least
potent. None of the three fractions, however, was found to
prevent the induction hypercholesterolemia in the chicks
[38].

Further studies on the alcoholic extract and two pure
compounds (a terpenoid and a steroid) isolated from the
petroleum ether extract showed that the steroid was highly
potent in lowering the serum cholesterol by 69.3 percent.The
alcoholic extract could lower the cholesterol by 59.2 percent,
whereas the terpenoid lowered it by 54.3 percent [38].
In another study, highly significant reduction in levels
of mean serum cholesterol and triglyceride was observed in
groups of animals receiving high-fat diet for onemonth along
with guggulu, which clearly demonstrated its hypolipidemic
activity. Additionally, administration of guggulu partially
reversed the atherosclerosis in the aorta that was induced by
high-fat diet [39].
Clinical studies on C. mukul showed its hypolipidemic
effect and the outcome of change in lipid profile upon its
administration. This study showed significant decrease in
total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol after treatment with
guggulu [40].
The hypolipidemic activity of the isomers 𝐸-guggulstero-
ne and𝑍-guggulsterone has also been studied in animalmod-
els. Administration of guggulsterone (𝑍 and 𝐸) significantly
lowered serum lipid levels of rats with either triton (WR-1339)
or cholesterol-induced hyperlipidemia [41].
Several mechanisms of action have been proposed for
the hypolipidemic action of guggulu. Guggulu may decrease
hepatic steroid production which ultimately increases the
catabolism of plasma LDL cholesterol. Alternatively, the
proposed active components of guggulu, guggulsterones 𝐸
and𝑍, may increase hepatic binding sites for LDL cholesterol,
thus increasing LDL clearance. However, recent findings have
suggested that guggulsterone 𝐸 and 𝑍 are highly efficacious
antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear
hormone receptor that is activated by bile acids, thus allowing
increased cholesterol catabolism and excretion from the body
[42, 43].
Guggulsterone and cembrenoids from C. mukul stem
bark resin were shown to be specific modulators of two
independent sites that are also modulated by bile salts to con-
trol cholesterol absorption and catabolism. Guggulsterone
antagonized the chenodeoxycholic acid-activated nuclear
farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which regulates cholesterol
metabolism in the liver. The cembrenoids did not show a
noticeable effect on FXR but lowered the cholate-activated
rate of human pancreatic IB phospholipase A
2
(hPLA2),
which controls gastrointestinal absorption of fat and choles-
terol [44].
4.2. Effect on Platelet Aggregation and Fibrinolytic Activity.
The purified steroid mixture from guggulu completely inhib-
ited ADP, adrenaline, or serotonin induced platelet aggrega-
tion. No difference was observed between the effectiveness
of the steroid mixture and the purified guggulsterone 𝐸 or
𝑍. The effect of guggulsterones 𝐸 and 𝑍 was very similar to
the inhibitory effect of clofibrate.This finding has therapeutic
value in myocardial infarction and thromboembolism [45].
The effect of guggulu on fibrinolysis and platelet adhe-
siveness in coronary heart disease was studied. Guggulu
fraction A (pet ether extract) in daily dose of 1 g was
administered to healthy individuals (group I) and to patients
of coronary artery disease (CAD) (group II) for a period of 30
days. Serum fibrinolytic activity increased, while the platelet
adhesive index decreased, which was statistically significant
in healthy individuals and in CAD patients. In view of this,
guggulu fraction A may be a useful therapeutic agent in the
management of coronary artery disease [46].
4.3. Thyroid Stimulatory Activity. Administration of ethano-
lic extract of guggulu to the female albino mice for 15 days
enhanced the triiodothyonine (T3) concentration and T3/T4
ratio, while nomarked change in the concentrations of serum
thyroxine (T4) was observed [47]. 𝑍-Guggulsterone was
shown to be responsible for the thyroid stimulatory action of
guggulu. Administration of isolated 𝑍-guggulsterone to rats
led to significant increase in all thyroid function parameters,
namely, uptake of iodine by the thyroid, enzymes involved in
the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and tissue oxygen uptake,
thus suggesting thyroid stimulatory action [48].
4.4. Anti-Inflammatory and Antiarthritic Activity. The
results of several studies confirm anti-inflammatory and
antiarthritic activities of guggulu [13, 15, 25, 49–52]. The 50
percent aqueous methanolic extract was found to exhibit
an anti-inflammatory effect on adjuvant-induced air pouch
granuloma in mice. The methanolic extract inhibited nitric
oxide production in lipopolysaccharide activated mouse
peritoneal macrophages [15]. A crystalline steroid was
isolated from the petroleum ether extract and tested in rats
for inhibition of inflammation induced by Freund’s adjuvant.
It inhibited the full development of the primary lesions in
adjuvant arthritis and also reduced the severity of secondary
lesions as compared with the untreated control group [53].
Guggulosomes prepared using guggul with ibuprofen
by bath sonication and trituration methods were studied
for anti-inflammatory activity. It was clearly shown that
guggulosomes had more efficacy than ibuprofen and both
guggul and ibuprofen had synergistic effect.The study proved
that guggul could serve as a carrier for entrapping drugs and
for their sustained release action [54].
Several animal studies have demonstrated the effective-
ness of guggulu extract in standard osteoarthritis (OA)
models. The authors had conducted both animal and clinical
investigations of guggulu for OA prior to this study. The goal

of this study was to determine the effectiveness of guggulu
for reduction of pain, stiffness, and other symptoms that arise
from OA [55].
4.5. Antioxidant Activity. The antioxidant property of gug-
gulu helped stop the oxidation of cholesterol and subsequent
hardening of the arteries, reduced the stickiness of platelet,
and also lowered the risk of coronary artery disease [45]. It
also enhanced the production of thyroxin and triiodothyro-
nine; these hormones increase the metabolism of carbohy-
drates and protein synthesis and help in lowering the lipid
activity [47].
The antioxidant activity was attributed to the presence of
guggulsterones. It was tested in vitro against the formation of
oxygen free radicals. The oxidation of human LDL induced
by Fe2+ or by rat peritoneal macrophages caused marked
formation of lipid peroxidation products. Guggulsterone
(50 𝜇M) prevented the generation of thiobarbituric acid
reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxide of low density
lipoprotein in above system.However, it did not protect lipids
against the formation of conjugated dienes, the initial step
of lipid peroxidation cascade. Guggulsterone significantly
inhibited the reaction of lipid peroxidation in liver micro-
somes challenged with Fe2+ and sodium ascorbate. Thus,

the protective action of guggulsterone might also be due to
free radical scavenging property.Themetal chelating capacity
of guggulsterone might be contributing to its antioxidant
activity [56]. Also, the alcoholic extract ofC. mukul exhibited
antioxidant property [57].
4.6. Antiatherosclerotic Activity. LDL has been found to
accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and is the major source
of the cholesterol accumulation in human foam cells.There is
evidence that LDL oxidation is essential for atherogenesis and
the antioxidants that prevent this oxidation may either slow
down or prevent atherogenesis. Guggulsterones, the lipid-
lowering components of guggulu, effectively inhibited in
vitro LDL oxidation (as discussed under antioxidant action).
Thus the combination of antioxidant and lipid-lowering
properties of guggulu makes it especially beneficial against
atherogenesis [58].
4.7. Cardioprotective Activity. Guggulsterones are shown to
be effective cardioprotectives. Myocardial necrosis induced
by isoproterenol in rats caused marked increase in serum
creatine phosphokinase and glutamate pyruvate transami-
nase. Phospholipase, xanthine oxidase, and lipid peroxides
were simultaneously enhanced in ischemic heart following
depletion of glycogen, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Treat-
ment with guggulsterone at a dose of 50mg/kg significantly
protected cardiac damage as assessed by the reversal of blood
and heart biochemical parameters in ischemic rats [59].
4.8. Cytotoxic Activity. Ferulates, important bioactive con-
stituents identified from the guggulu gum, were reported
to play a significant role in in vitro cytotoxicity by decreas-
ing the cell viability in MCF-7 (breast) tumor cells, PC-3
(prostate) tumor cells, and parental and transfected P 388
cells [49]. Therefore, ferulate compounds are used in the
method for prevention and treatment of abnormal cell growth
and proliferation of inflammation, neoplasia, and cardio-
vascular disease. Ethyl acetate extract showed significant in
vitro cytotoxicity. A fraction showing cytotoxic activity was
characterized as a mixture of two ferulates with an unusual
skeleton by spectral and chemical methods.This fraction also
showed moderate scavenging effect against 2,2-diphenyl-1-
picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radicals [60].
Treatment with gugulipid significantly inhibited the via-
bility of human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (androgen-
dependent) and its androgen-independent variant (C-81)
with IC
50
of 1𝜇M(24 h treatment), thus indicating its possible
role in apoptosis and cancer prevention [60]. The results of
this study indicated that guggulsterone inhibited prolifera-
tion of PC-3 cells in culture by causing apoptosis, whereas
a normal prostate epithelial cell line is resistant to growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction by this phytoconstituent.
These observations provided rationale for further preclinical
and clinical evaluation of guggulsterone for its efficacy against
prostate cancer [61].
4.9. Antifertility Activity. Guggulu administered orally (2 and
20mg/100 g body weight) to female rats decreased the weight
of the uterus, ovaries, and cervix, whereas glycogen and sialic
acid levels in these organs increased. This suggested that
guggulu may be useful as an antifertility agent [62].
4.10. Skin Diseases. Administration of gugulipid was report-
ed to be effective in the treatment of nodulocystic acne. A
study in 21 patients found that gugulipid was as effective
as tetracycline in the treatment. The patients with oily faces
responded better to the gugulipid treatment [63].
4.11. Antihyperglycemic Activity. Administration of alcoholic
extract of C. mukul at a dose of 200mg/kg for 60 continuous
days reduced plasma glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats [57]. A study showing effect of guggulsterone
Scientifica 11
isolated from C. mukul in high-fat diet induced diabetic rats
has also been reported. Different biochemical parameters like
GTT, glycogen content, glucose homeostatic enzymes (like
glucose-6-phosphatase and hexokinase), insulin release in
vivo, and expression profiles of various genes involved in
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism clearly demonstrated the
hypoglycemic effect.The results suggested that guggulsterone
has both hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects which can
help cure type II diabetes [64].
4.12. Antimicrobial Activity. The volatile oil of C mukul was
found to be highly effective against Rhyzopertha dominica
which suggested its role as a fumigant. The ethanolic extract
of C. mukul exhibited best antibacterial activity at 5mg/
mL against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia [65].
An active compound, 5(1-methyl,1-aminoethyl)-5-methyl-2-
octanone, of the methanolic extract of guggulu gum pos-
sessed significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive
bacteria and moderate activity against Gram-negative bacte-
ria [66–68].
5. Safety and Toxicity
It has been mentioned in Ayurvedic texts that administration
of raw guggulu may sometimes lead to skin rashes, irregular
menstruation, diarrhoea, headache, mild nausea, and, with
very high doses, liver toxicity [5]. In order to overcome the
side effects of raw guggulu, Ayurveda describes a number of
purification processes (shodhan vidhi) in different “dravyas,”
that is, fluids, which not only take care of the adverse
effects but also enhance the therapeutic activity [2]. It is also
mentioned in Ayurvedic texts that guggulu must be purified
before incorporation into herbal formulations. There are a
large number of commercial polyherbal anti-inflammatory
formulations which are using guggulu as the chief ingredient
[52].
The clinical trials done with standardized gum guggul
extracts reported transient side effects such as skin rashes,
diarrhoea, and irregular menstruations [33]. A report also
states that, out of 22 individuals receiving 2160mg guggulu
daily for 12 weeks, 10 persons experienced one or another
side effect including gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, and
skin rash [69]. Skin rashes have also been reported in other
trials using 1-2 g guggulipid (ethyl acetate fraction) daily for a
month. This study did not report any intestinal distress [70].
Although generally accepted as relatively safe, caution
may be warranted during guggul consumption. There is little
or no information on toxicity with the use of guggulu.
6. Conclusions
From this review article it is concluded that the resin of
Commiphora wightii, guggulu, has emerged as a good source
of the traditional medicines for the treatment of inflam-
mation, arthritis, obesity, microbial infection, wound, pain,
fractures, tumor, and gastrointestinal diseases. It is one of the
oldest and the most prominent herbs in Ayurvedic medicine.
Guggulu is a versatile drug and, because of its paranormal
properties, it is very valuable in treating variety of disorders.
Pharmacological results have validated the use of this plant
in the traditional medicines. This plant contains a num-
ber of bioactive constituents including terpenoids, steroids,
flavonoids, guggultetrols, lignans, sugars, and amino acids.
Guggulsterones 𝐸 and 𝑍 are the chief bioactive constituents
of this resin and are endowedwith immense pharmacological
value.These conclusions could open a newwindowon the use
of this plant inAyurveda.This review clearly authenticates the
Sanskrit definition of the term “guggul” whichmeans one that
protects against diseases. It is superbly reflected and proved
by the diverse medicinal uses of this Ayurvedic drug.
In vitro studies and clinical trials help improve and
advance medical care.They also assist health care profession-
als to direct resources to the strategies and treatments that
would work best for a particular type of ailment. Although
the use of guggulu in therapeutic doses appears to be safe
and nontoxic more and more of such studies should still be
conducted so that chances of any toxicity, if any, can be ruled
out. It has also been mentioned that during the course of
using guggulu one should avoid foods that are sour or bitter in
taste, alcohol, excessive exercise, physical and mental strain,
anger, and exposure to direct sunlight. Such data can only be
validated when we would choose in vitro studies over in vivo
studies.
Also, this plant is listed in IUCN list and thus rationale
usage of the plant is the need of the hour so that we do
not end up depleting this wonder drug of high therapeutic
importance. Keeping this in view, stem, bark, and leaf of
this plant should receive more attention so that the complete
depletion on account of plant death due to tapping can be
checked. This plant still possesses an unexplored potential
and expansion of research materials would provide more
opportunities for the discovery of novel bioactive principles
from this plant.
