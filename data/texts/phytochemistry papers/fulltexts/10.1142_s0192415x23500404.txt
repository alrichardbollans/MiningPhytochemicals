This fungus has over 428 species, with Ganoderma lucidum being themost studied. The Ganoderma species produce several secondary metabolites and bioactivecompounds like polysaccharides, phenols, and triterpenes, which are largely responsible fortheir therapeutic properties. Throughout this review, several extracts obtained from Gano-derma species have been studied to delve into their therapeutic characteristics andmechanisms. Such properties like immunomodulation, antiaging, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer activities have been demonstrated by several Ganoderma species and are supportedby a large body of evidence. Although its phytochemicals play a vital role in its therapeuticproperties, identifying the therapeutic potentials of fungal-secreted metabolites for humanhealth-promoting benefits is a challenging task.

These species are easily identified in their native habitats due to their unusual fruitingbodies. So far, 428 different species of Ganoderma have been identified. Some of the veryprominent species of Ganoderma are Ganoderma amboinense, G. annulare, G. applanatum,G. australe, G. boninense, G. capense, G. carnosum, G. cochlear, G. colossum, G. concinna,G. fornicatum, G. hainanense, G. lipsiense (synonym G. applanatum), G. mastoporum, G.neo-japonicum, G. orbiforme, G. pfeifferi, G. resinaceum, G. sinense, G. theaecolum, G.tropicum, G. tsugae, G. leucocontextum, and G. sinense.As these Ganoderma species are predominantly parasitic and saprophytic on conifershardwood and are rather selective about their substrates, these species prefer to attack andparasitise specific trees. The fungus’ extraordinary ability to produce diverse secondarymetabolites (SMs) allows it to thrive in both parasitic and saprophytic modes of the life-cycle. Traditional remedies, as well as functional foods and nutraceuticals, make extensiveuse of SMs generated from these mushrooms. Meta-information generated via thecomputational approach of Ganoderma’s SMs along with its experimental evidenceindicates their distinct chemical scaffolds with different biological prowess (Grienke et al.,2015). For its therapeutic capabilities, Ganoderma species are also referred to as the‘Mushroom of Immortality (Li et al., 2013).Furthermore, Ganoderma lucidum or lingzhi (Reishi mushrooms), which is one themost studied Ganoderma species, is known for its health benefits. Some of these benefitsinclude anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertension, andanti-lipidic activities. It has been used in traditional Asian medicine for thousands of yearsin the form of powder, tea, and dietary supplements to treat different health conditions anddiseases and is known in Chinese medicine as the “King of Herbs” or “Miracle ChineseHerb” (Sliva, 2003; Benzie and Wachtel-Galor, 2009; Parepalli et al., 2021b).Ganoderma extracts contain several bioactive compounds, and the main physiologicallyactive ingredients include polysaccharides, peptidoglycans, proteins, peptides, phenols, andtriterpenes (Parepalli et al., 2021a). The Ganoderma extracts have been used for decades intraditional Asian medicine, particularly in China and Japan, as the best natural source ofanti-oxidants (Koo et al., 2011), an all-cure herb, and an effective medicine in combattingdiseases like AIDS and cancer (Cör et al., 2018).Furthermore, Ganoderma is used to strengthen the immune system and to treat viralinfections (HIV/AIDS), as well as to treat lung (like asthma and bronchitis), heart, liver,kidney, and cancer diseases (Wachtel-Galor et al., 2011; Kao et al., 2013).2 R.

Major secondary compounds isolated are ganodericacids, C30 lanostanes (aldehydes, alcohols, esters, glycosides, lactones, ketones), C27lanostanes (lucidenic acids), C27 lanostanes (alcohols, lactones, esters), C24 and C25lanostanes, C30 pentacyclic triterpenes, meroterpenoids, farnesyl hydroquinones (mer-oterpenoids), C15 sesquiterpenoids, steroids, alkaloids, prenyl hydroquinone, gano-dermanontriol, ganodermaside A, ganodermalactone G, ganoderone A and C,ganoboninone D, benzofurans, benzopyran-4-one derivatives, and benzenoid derivatives(Sharma et al., 2019). In addition, bioactive compounds, such as lectins, beta-glucans,polysaccharide-protein complexes, and lanostanoids, have also been identified in thesespecies (Borchers et al., 2008) (Fig. 1).Therapeutic Capabilities of Ganoderma SpeciesAn extensive variety of medicinal and pharmacokinetic properties have been observedfrom metabolites extracted from Ganoderma species, and these metabolites are beingused as anti-cancer agents and anti-oxidants, and possess anti-ageing, anti-inflammatory,and anti-immunomodulatory activities, amongst others (Fig. 2). In addition, their use inregulating blood cholesterol, treating respiratory diseases, and lowering anxiety levelshas also been observed (Nishitoba et al., 1998; Ikekawa et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1998).Due to their versatility, Ganoderma extracts are frequently used for treating hepatitis,hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, neoplasms, immunodeficiency, leukopenia, atheroscle-rosis, haemorrhoids, chronic fatigue, cancer, bronchitis, hypertension, insomnia, andFigure 1.

Furthermore, the bioactive compounds of Ganoderma also exhibitanti-angiogenic, multidrug resistance reversal, and anti-proliferative and apoptosis in-ductive activities by involving the intrinsic and extrinsic initiated apoptotic pathway inassociation with cell cycle arrest, telomerase inhibition, autophagy, and oxidativestress, in addition to the inhibition of tumor cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. Theantitumor activities may be due to the inhibition of ATP-dependent transmembranedrug transporters such as P-glycoprotein on the surface of resistance tumor cells toprevent reduction of the intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs (Sun andSun, 2019).Triterpenes in mushrooms possess chemo-preventive and tumoricidal activities(Leskosek-Cukalovic et al., 2010). Triterpenes activate the capase cascade, which helps toprevent cancer metastasis by directing matrix metalloproteinase and interleukin (IL)-8 andreduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage cells. Polysaccharides, on theother hand, can boost the immunological response of the host by promoting the growth ofmacrophages, natural killer cells, and T-lymphocytes. This may stop tumor-derivedFigure 2. Therapeutic applications of Ganoderma metabolites.4 R.

The triterpenes act as anti-oxidants by scavenging free radicals andactivating anti-oxidant enzymes, whereas polysaccharides reduce oxidative damage causedby reactive oxygen species and prevent the breaks of DNA strands (Kao et al., 2013).G. lucidum extracts are carcinostatic in a variety of cancer cell lines, including pan-creatic, lung, colon, skin, breast, prostate, and liver cancer cell lines (Suprasert, 2015; Yuet al., 2017; Zhang, 2017). Furthermore, the compounds from G. lucidium (Xu et al., 2011)and G. applanatum have been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic, andcytotoxic properties (Elkhateeb et al., 2018). Triterpenes such as ganoderic acids U-Y andF are cytotoxic to hepatoma cells (O. Toth et al., 1983) and inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (Morigiwa et al., 1986; Zhang et al., 2009), respectively.Furthermore, the ganoderic acid DM possesses anti-proliferative properties against humanmalignant growth cells by altering androgen or oestrogen receptors (Liu et al., 2006; Wuet al., 2012) and has apoptotic effects in Michigan Cancer Foundation (MCF)-7 breast cancercells; additionally, it hinders testosterone change to dihydrotestosterone through 5 α-reductaseinhibitory activity (Liu et al., 2006; Suárez-Arroyo et al., 2017). Anti-proliferative effects ofganoderiol A, ganoderiol F, ganoderol B, lucidumol B, ganodermatriol, and ganoderma-nontriol against prostrate cells have also been discovered (Jiang et al., 2011).ImmunomodulationGanoderma exerts immunomodulation effects by enhancing humoral and cellular immu-nity (Wang and Lin, 2019). These effects may be due to its bioactive molecules, partic-ularly polysaccharides. It was found that the polysaccharide contents of G. lucidum play arole in promoting the function of antigen-presenting cells, humoral immunity, mononuclearphagocyte system, and cellular immunity (Lin, 2005). Many studies reported that Gano-derma exhibits significant antitumor and anti-inflammatory activity and promotes the ac-tivity of most immune effector cells, including lymphocytes and myeloid cells (Ren et al.,2021). Numerous studies linked the antitumor effects and enhanced immune system byGanoderma supplements or extracts. In addition, the aqueous extracts of Ganodermastimulate the production of cytokines, such as interleukins IL-2, IL-10, IL-1β- IL-6 andtumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon – Y (INF-Y) (Sanodiya et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2018).Smina et al. (2017) reported that total triterpenes induced apoptosis in human breastadenocarcinoma cells by regulating the levels of cyclin D1 and B cell lymphomas, and byupregulating the levels of Bax and caspase-9. Furthermore, Zheng et al. (2018) reportedthat the antitumor effects may be due to the effect of Ganoderma as a dehydroergosterolperoxide enzyme by its role in the process of decreasing the expression of the myeloidleukemia cell differentiation protein, releasing cytochrome-c and damaging the mito-chondrial membrane. In addition, Ganoderma promotes the function of phagocytes, naturalkiller cells, antigen-presenting cells, lymphocytes, and cytotoxic T- lymphocytes, andpromotes the production of cytokines (Zhibin Lin and Sun, 2019).6 R. BLUNDELL et al.March 23, 2023 11:50:15am WSPC/174-AJCM 2350040 ISSN: 0192-415X1stReading12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243Moreover, β-D-glucans, the Zhi-8 proteins, and triterpenoids are the known immuno-modulating agents identified from Ganoderma. These compounds stimulate immuneeffectors and cause cytokine production (Wang et al., 1997). They additionally preventsystemic anaphylaxis in mice (Kino et al., 1989), stimulate immune regulation (Tanakaet al., 1989), are an adjuvant for the DNA vaccine via dendritic cells activation (Lin et al.,2011), and stimulate cancer cell death (Li et al., 2014; Hsin et al., 2015).Furthermore, polysaccharides promote cancer and viral immunity by increasing theexpression of the major histocompatibility complex in a melanoma cell line, whichimproves antigen presentation (Sun et al., 2010). G. microsporum extracts also causeapoptosis in urothelial cancer cells (Huang et al., 2018). As a result, the proteins implicatedin Ganoderma immunomodulation might be used to develop immunotherapy.Anti-Oxidative and Radical Scavenging ActivityGanoderma anti-oxidants protect cellular components from oxidative damage, loweringthe likelihood of mutations and carcinogenesis, as well as immune cells, allowing them tomaintain immune surveillance and responsiveness as shown in Table 2. Furthermore, G.lucidum polysaccharides safeguard immune cells from oxidative stress, while the ethanolicextract breaks cellular DNA by boosting the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),causing considerable cell death. Additionally, G. lucidum methanolic extracts protectkidneys from cisplatin-induced kidney injury by restoring the renal anti-oxidant defencesystem (Sheena et al., 2003).Table 2.

Organic extracts of G.lucidum have antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium diphtheria,Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp.,Staphylococcus aureus (Sheena et al., 2003; Keypour et al., 2008), S. aureus, and B.cereus (Heleno et al., 2013). Moreover, G. pfeifferi extracts also inhibited the growth ofpathogenic bacteria such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrioanguillarum, and Yersinia ruckeri (Monthana, 1999).Based on our previous studies, it can be concluded that the antimicrobial activity of purecompounds should be below 1000 μg/ml. We have shown that the strong activity is forMICs below 300 μg/ml, medium activity for MICs 300–500 μg/ml, and poor activity forMICs > 500 to 1000 μg/ml (Adamczak et al., 2020; Karpiński et al., 2021). The values ofMIC above 1000 μg/ml should be considered as very poor activity or lack of activity(> 5000 μg/ml). Extracts and fractions of Ganoderma have mainly poor or lack of activity.Regardless of the Ganoderma species, the MIC values for extracts most often range from500 μg/ml to even 512mg/ml (Sa-Ard et al., 2015; El Zawawy and Ali, 2016; Ergun,2017; Costa et al., 2020; Savin et al., 2020; Serrano-Márquez et al., 2021). For singlestrains, incl. Enterococcus faecalis, extract of G. lucidum has a strong activity with an MICof 200 μg/ml (Ergun, 2017). Some isolated compounds exhibit poor or no significantantimicrobial activity, e.g. chitosan from G. lucidum (MICs 625–2500 μg/ml) (Savin et al.,2020) and sulfated (1,3)-β-d-glucan from G. lucidum, for which the MIC values are 1000–5000 μg/ml (Wan-Mohtar et al., 2016). Similarly, exopolysaccharide from G. applanatumshows poor activity with an MIC of 1000 μg/ml (Osińska-Jaroszuk et al., 2014). Lanostanetriterpenoids and farnesyl hydroquinones are the most active. The MIC values for theformer start from 0.391 μg/ml (Isaka et al., 2016; Chinthanom et al., 2021), and for thelatter from 2.5 μg/ml (Mothana et al., 2000).Some antibacterial studies presented the disk diffusion method (ZOI) instead of MIC.The authors present the activity, unfortunately, without specifying the MIC value or theactive concentration. The disc diffusion test provides qualitative results showing if bacteriaare susceptible or resistant (Benkova et al., 2020). Consider that this research extractedfreeze-dried culture fluids of G. lucidum extracts that have activity against Acidovoraxavenae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Brenneria quercina, Erwinia carotovora, Pantoeaherbicola, Pseudomonas syringae, and Xanthomonas campestris (Robles-Hernández et al.,2021). Extracts of G. boninense in ZOI method are active against coagulase-negativeStaphylococci (CoNS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcuspyogenes (Chan and Chong, 2022).Anti-Fungal ActivityExtracts of G. lucidum are active against Botrytis cinerea, Physalospora piricola, andFusarium oxysporum (Wang and Ng, 2006), and against Trichoderma viridae that exceed8 R. BLUNDELL et al.March 23, 2023 11:50:15am WSPC/174-AJCM 2350040 ISSN: 0192-415X1stReading12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243more than the standards, i.e., bifonazole and ketoconazole (Heleno et al., 2013). Antifungalcharacteristics are found in sterols derived from G. annulare, such as 5α-ergost-7-en-3β-ol,5α-ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, and 5,8-epidioxy-5α,8α-ergosta-6,22-dien-3β-ol and five tri-terpenes, applanoxidic acids A, C, F, G and H (Smania et al., 2003). The terpenoids werefound to be active against Microsporum cannis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (Smaniaet al., 2003).Furthermore, in terms of antifungal activity, the best activity is shown by triterpe-noids obtained from G. gibbosum. The MIC50 of these triterpenoids against Candidaalbicans is 3.8–129.1 μg/ml (Pu et al., 2019). Benzolactones isolated from G. lucidumalso have a strong activity. Their MIC90 against Microsporum gypseum ranges from 18.5up to > 128 μg/ml (Lu et al., 2020). Unfortunately, there is little research into theantifungal activity of Ganoderma species. In addition, one of the studies on farnesylhydroquinones from G. pfeifferi showed no activity. However, MIC values were onlydetermined up to 100 μg/ml (Mothana et al., 2000). This means that hydroquinonesshould also be tested at higher concentrations, which would clearly show activity or lackthereof.Antiviral ActivityCompounds of gray level histogram width (GLhw) and GLMe-1, 2, 4, and 7 from G.lucidum significantly inhibited cytopathic effects of the vesicular stomatitis virus andherpes simplex virus (HSV) (Sharma et al., 2019). GLhw inhibited plaque formation ofHSV-2 and HEp-2 cells, while GLMe-4 showed cytotoxicity (Liu et al., 2004; Sharmaet al., 2019). Furthermore, terpenoids derived from G. pfeifferi have antiviral propertiesagainst influenza and Herpes simplex virus (Lindequist et al., 2015). Moreover, appla-noxidic acid G, lucialdehyde, lucidadiol, and ergosta-7,22-diene-3β-ol compounds fromGanoderma possess antiviral properties against influenza virus A (Mothana et al., 2003;Niedermeyer et al., 2005). The combination of ganomycin B and ganomycin I from G.colossum inhibits HIV-1 protease (El Dine et al., 2009).Most studies of the antiviral activity of Ganoderma species indicate good activity.Lanostane triterpenoids have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 protease at IC50 concentrationsfrom 5 μg/ml or from 20 μM (El Dine et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2009). Triterpenoids alsoshow strong inhibitory activity against H1N1 influenza virus neuraminidase (IC50 from4.6 μM), H5N1 influenza virus neuraminidase (IC50 from 1.2 μM), HSV-1 (ED500.068mM/l), and influenza virus type A (ED50 0.19–0.22mM/l) (Mothana et al., 2003;Zhu et al., 2015). However, the activity of triterpenoids against Dengue virus NS2B-NS3protease was confirmed in silico analysis (Bharadwaj et al., 2019). Extracts from Gano-derma against Dengue virus serine protease and enterovirus A71 show a lower antiviralactivity (over 25 μg/ml) (Lim et al., 2020; Ang et al., 2021). Thus, as seen, Ganoderma hasextensive antimicrobial properties.In Tables 3 and 4, the antimicrobial activities of extracts or compounds from someGanoderma species are presented.PHYTOCHEMICALS OF GANODERMA SPECIES 9March 23, 2023 11:50:16am WSPC/174-AJCM 2350040 ISSN: 0192-415X1stReading12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243Table3.ASummaryoftheMainComponentsinGanodermaSpeciesthatDemonstrateAntimicrobialActivityGanodermaSpp.Compound/sTargetMicroorganismsActiveConcentrationReferenceG.applanatumExopolysaccharideStaphylococcusaureusMIC1000μg/ml(Osińska-Jaroszuketal.,2014)G.australeNaturallanostanetriterpenoid:ganodermicacidMycobacteriumtuberculosisMIC0.391μg/ml(Chinthanometal.,2021)SemisyntheticlanostanetriterpenoidsMICfrom0.0977to>50μg/mlG.colossumLanostanetriterpenesHIV-1proteaseIC50from5upto>100μg/ml(ElDineetal.,2008)G.curtisiiExtractStaphylococcusaureusMICfrom500upto>1000μg/ml(Serrano-Márquezetal.,2021)EnterococcusfaecalisMIC>1000μg/mlEscherichiacoliMIC>1000μg/mlPseudomonasaeruginosaMIC>1000μg/mlG.gibbosumTriterpenoids:gibbosicolidsCandidaalbicansMIC504.7–129.1μg/ml(Puetal.,2019)Triterpenoids:gibbosicacidsMIC503.8–70μg/mlG.lingzhiTriterpenoids:ganodericacids,ganoderenicacids,ganoluci-dicacid,ganoderiols,gano-dermanondiol,lucialdehydesH1N1influenzavirusneuramini-daseIC504.6upto>200μM(Zhuetal.,2015)H5N1influenzavirusneuramini-daseIC501.2upto>200μMG.lipsienseCrudeextractEscherichiacoliMIC>1000μg/ml(Costaetal.,2020)PseudomonasaeruginosaMIC500μg/mlStaphylococcusaureusMIC>1000μg/mlFractionsEscherichiacoliMIC1000μg/mlPseudomonasaeruginosaMIC500upto>1000μg/mlStaphylococcusaureusMIC500upto>1000μg/ml10 R.

Neuroprotective effects of G. lucidum on Spinal Cord Injury(SCI) of a model organism rat have also been observed (Ekinci et al., 2018). G. lucidumreduces SCI-induced oxidative stress and promotes neuroprotection by lowering lipidperoxidation and glutathione depletion (Ekinci et al., 2018).The bioactive molecules in Ganoderma play a crucial role in neuroprotective effects ordiseases by sedative, hypnotic, anti-nociceptive, analgesic, neuroprotective, anti-epileptic,and anti-depressant effects (Cui and Zhang, 2019). Some studies demonstrated thatGanoderma extracts, especially its content of polysaccharides, have increased neuron vi-ability, reduced malondialdehyde content and reactive oxygen species levels, increased themanganese dismutase activity, and blocked the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B(Zhao et al., 2004).Other Medicinal Attributes of GanodermaTriterpenoids and steroids from G. lucidum and G. tsugae inhibit the effect of the chemicalmediators liberated from neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages (Ko et al., 2008). Therelease of β-glucuronidase from rat neutrophils induced with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)/cytochalasin B was significantly inhibited by 3-oxo-5-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-oic acid (Koet al., 2008). This confirmed Ganoderma’s anti-inflammatory properties.Furthermore, according to previous studies, many digestive system diseases can beameliorated by natural products such as Ganoderma supplements. In these studies, theGanoderma extracts play a role in improving the symptoms of gastric mucosal congestionand bleeding, decreasing inflammatory factors, serum histamine, and myeloperoxidasewhilst increasing the anti-oxidant activity and defence factors such as nitric oxide (NO) andendothelial growth factor (EGF) (Tian et al., 2022).Additionally, different Ganoderma extracts were used for decades as an elixir forlifespan elongation since they exert many functions in improving health and longevity(Wang et al., 2017). These extracts enhance the anti-ageing properties such as helping tofight off skin-damaging free radicals, repair collagen in the body. and reduce inflammationas demonstrated in Table 5.Unsurprisingly, the highly biologically active constituents of Ganoderma extracts havebeen shown to have hypoglycemic effects. The extracts have been reported to exhibit anti-diabetic activity by increasing plasma insulin levels, decreasing plasma glucose levels,decreasing lymphocyte infiltration and inhibiting aldolase reductase, a-glucosidase, andprotein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (Ma et al., 2015). Thus, as summarized in Table 6,Ganoderma species have a wide spectrum of medicinal attributes.Concluding Remarks and Future PerspectivesAs demonstrated throughout this review, the phytoconstituents of Ganoderma speciescontribute to their therapeutic properties.

This worksubstantially contributes to the understanding of Ganoderma’s core pharmacologicallyactive compounds and illustrates the immense therapeutic potential of SMs generated fromthis fungus. The opine is that the understanding of the SMs of Ganoderma might help tofurther establish it as a pharmacologically applicable medication.AcknowledgmentsThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies on the public,commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.ReferencesAbate, M., G.
