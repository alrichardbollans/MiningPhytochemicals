(Khaksi) is an annual or biennial winter herb belonging to the Brassicaceae or Cruciferae family. It has been used as a medicine since antiquity. Today, it is used as a Unani and folk medicine in various regions of the world for its antipyretic, anti-choleric, aphrodisiac, expectorant and appetizer properties. The various parts of the plant possess many phytochemicals such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, beta-sitosterol, oils, etc., which are known to exhibit several pharmacological actions like antioxidative, antimicrobial, antipyretic, anticancer, and hepatoprotective activities. The literature is taken from Unani classical books and online databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, with the keywords khaksi, Sisymbrium irio, phytochemicals, and their pharmacological actions. Keywords: Khaksi; London Rocket; Pyrexia; Sisymbrium irio; Unani medicine    Introduction The Unani system of medicine is one of the oldest traditional medicinal systems that have been used for centuries to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases. Unani system of medicine addresses homeostasis of the body, which depends on the balance of the four humors (akhlat) and temperament (mizaj) which are balanced by six essential factors1. Unani medicine promotes health and treats ailments using a variety of approaches such as regimental therapy, diet therapy, and pharmacotherapy. This system relies mainly on plant-origin drugs, then animal and mineral-origin drugs2,3. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Unani medicines with little or no adverse effects. Many herbal medications have recently undergone standardization, quality assurance, toxicity profiling, and formulations listed in the Unani Pharmacopeia of India have been validated2. Sisymbrium irio L. (S. irio), belonging to the family Brassicaceae or Cruciferae is an important medicinal plant used in Unani system of medicine. S. irio is often known as Khaksi, Khubah, Khub kalan, London rocket/Rocket mustard, and is found in different parts of the world4. S. irio is native to southern Europe, North Africa and temperate Asia but has been carried by migrants to North America, Australasia and South Africa. The tap-rooted herbaceous plant reproduces entirely by seed5. It grows near roadways, fences, and ditches6,7. It is used as febrifuge, expectorant, anti-asthmatic, aphrodisiac, cardio-tonic, diuretic, laxative, lubricant, hepato-protective, rubefacient8-10 anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, and also used for dietary purposes; as it is rich in nutrients and protein11. S. irio contains numerous bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, phenolics, glucosinolates, carbohydrates, fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, and steroids4,12-14. These compounds possess various pharmacological actions such as antipyretic, Tamkanat et al.

This review explore the potential of Khaksi as mentioned in Unani literature with its phytochemical and pharmacological scientific advancement.  Material and Methods Khaksi was searched in classical Unani literature for its temperament (mizaj), medicinal properties, and therapeutic applications. Urdu translations of classical textbooks such as Muheet Azam of Hakeem Mohammad Azam Khan, Khazainul Advia of Najmul Ghani, Makhzanul Mufaradat and Bayaz e Kabir of Hakeem Mohammed Kabiruddin, Qarabadeen e Majeedi, National Formulation of Unani Medicine, and others were conferred. Published publications from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar and Research Gate were used to gather all available information about its phytochemicals and pharmacological research. The proper Unani terminologies were described using Standard Unani Medical Terminology, which was published by the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Description of Khaksi in Unani Literature Table 1: Alternative name in different languages  Morphology (Māhiyat): Khaksi is an annual or biennial, highly variable, stiffly erect, 20 - 60 cm tall, tap-rooted herb. Stems 2-10 mm thick, leaves stalked, pinnatified or partite, lower leaves are broader than the upper leaves, lobes not auricled, tooth distant, terminal large, rarely hastate. The Flowers are yellow, minute, pedicle slender. Pods narrow, erect, 3-5 cm long, subtorulose, glabrous, valves 3 nerved, pedicles curved ascending, and stigma sessile. Seeds are small, pitted, present in series, reddish brown / orangish-brown, mucilaginous with a warty surface; odor pungent like mustard oil and taste like bitter mustard oil7,17,21. The beans of the herb resemble mustard beans but are much smaller and filled with seeds that resemble poppy seeds (Tukhm-i-khashkhash)19,20,23. They are Self-pollinated, and disseminated through seeds7. Parts used (Hasas-i-Musta'mla): Leaves and seeds24 Temperament (Mizāj): Unani system of medicine places a strong emphasis on drug temperament as a fundamental notion for understanding drug activity. The relationship between a person's temperament and a drug's temperament provides a foundation for the effective use of drugs, forecasting its effects, and determining potency. Unani physicians categorize medications into four categories (hot, cold, wet, and dry) based on their impact on a moderate human body25. The temperament of Khaksi is hot and wet in the second degree18,20,23; hot in second degree and wet in first degree26.

The result showed that seeds have safe upto the doses of 1000mg/kg, but at dose of 2000 mg/kg few percentages of mortality was recorded in both strains63.  Conclusion After reviewing the literature and scientific studies, it can be concluded that Khaksi is a drug that has been used in Unani system of medicine for the treatment of pyrexia in epidemic conditions since a long time, that is supported by advanced phytochemicals and pharmacological research. The flavonoids found in Khaksi, particularly apigetrin has drawn attention due to its potential to target cancer cell of multiple organs selectively, it may be a good candidate for further exploration in various ailments.
