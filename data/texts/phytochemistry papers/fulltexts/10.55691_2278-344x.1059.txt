IntroductionO fficially Nelumbonaceae family consists of twoplants i.e. Nelumbo nucifera and Nelumbo lutea(see Table 1). In this review we will discuss aboutNelumbo nucifera which is an aquatic perennialherbal plant having a growth of about 1.5 m and amaximum horizontal stretch of 3 m. The diameter ofits leaves may reach up to 60 cm that floats on top ofthe water surface whilst its roots are still linked tothe mucky bottom of the water bodies. The flowersare found on stalks that rise above the leaves andcan be up to 20 cm in diameter [1].This plant has been valued for ages as a sacredsymbol by many cultures, including Hindus, Bud-dhists, and Egyptians. Most Asian nations, includingJapan, China, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand,are home to this species and it's also the nationalflower of Vietnam and India. Nelumbo nucifera waslong ago introduced to America and WesternEurope, and it is also found in Russia and Australia[3]. It has varied colloquial names such as Chinesewater lily, lotus, etc. [4] In India it's commonly calledas ‘kamala’, but it still has different vernacularnames in various regions of India as well as indifferent parts of the world:Sanskrit: Sitopala, Abja, Kalhira, Pankaja, Padma,English: Lotus.Hindi: Kamal, KanwalOriya: Padma.Kannada: Kamal, Naidile, Tavare, Tavaregedd,Punjabi: Pamposh, Kanwal,Tamil: Aravindan, Tamarai, Paduman, Sarojam[5].There are various botanical names used indifferent sites and literatures for Lotus such asReceived 10 April 2023; accepted 4 September 2023.Available online 15 November 2023* Corresponding author at: JSS College of Pharmacy, Mysuru, Karnataka, 570015, India.E-mail addresses: sparsh.mahanoori@gmail.com (S.

This is an open access article under the CC-BY-NC-ND license(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).Nymphaea nelumbo, Nelumbium nelumbo orNelumbium speciosum, even these are correct as theywere the old names referring the plant, but Nelumbonucifera is the latest official name given [4]. Lotus has0.5e2.5 cm in dia. cylindrical shaped rhizomes thatare yellowish-white to yellowish-brown in colourhaving longitudinal brown patch marks withdifferent nodes and internodes [6]. In a study con-ducted by Maharana S. et al., 2022 it was observedthat the seeds have blackish brown colour with ovalto globular shape and the fruit size ranges from 0.5to 2 cm. In microscopic analysis it was observed thatthe fruit pericarp is unbreakable and extremelyhard, the fruit wall surface had minute pores and inorder to facilitate gas exchange, these pores arebordered with hexagonal cells. Other than theepidermal pores the fruit also displayed rosettescleride and double-layered palisade tissue. Alka-loids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins, terpenoids,phenols and tannins were the phytochemicals foundin the methanolic seed extract. The starch grains'morphology was discovered to be basic, elliptical topolygonal, and oval in shape. By using acetic acid,water, and butanol (1:1:4 v/v/v) as the solvent sys-tem, the HPTLC fingerprint of the hot and coldextract revealed the presence of 9 bands on theplate, Rf raning from 0.05 to 0.94 [7]. In anotherstudy by Ruvanthika et al., 2017 glycosides werepresent in aqueous, acetone and ethanol extract ofthe seeds [8].1.1. Chemical constituentsFlower Petals:The Nelumbo nucifera flower petals’ ethanolicextract contains eight distinct compounds:A. myricetin-3-O-D-glucopyranoside,B. quercetin-3-O-D-glucuronide,C. astragalin,D. quercetin,E. 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid,F. kaempeforol,G. p-hydroxybenzoic acid,H. b-sitosterol.Compounds A, B, D, E, F, G, and H were amongthose isolated from Nelumbo nucifera petals for thefirst time. Compounds A and E were initiallydiscovered in the genus Nelumbo [9].Rhizomes: By using chemical and spectroscopictechniques, the rhizomes of Nelumbo nucifera yiel-ded maslinic acid, hyptatic acid-A,2a,24ediacetoxye3behydroxyoleane12eene28eoicacid (new triterpenoid), betulin, and lupeol [10].Seed Embryos: Four familiar chemical com-pounds, liensinine, neferine, anisic acid and iso-liensinine, das well as three bisbenzylisoquinolinealkaloids, nelumborines A and B, and nelumbofer-ine dwere identified from the embryos of Nelumbonucifera seeds [11].Seeds: 1-Heptadecanol; 1-Monolinoleoylglyceroltrimethylsilyl ether; 3-hydroxy-7-isopropenyl-1,4a-dimethyl-2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8-octahydronaphthalen-2-ylester; 4,22-Stigmastadiene-3-one; 9,12-Octadecadie-noic acid; Di-n-octyl phthalate; 11-Hexadecenoicacid; Acetic acid; Ergost-25-ene-3,5,6,12-tetrol,(3.beta., 5.alpha., 6.beta., 12.beta.); Hexadecanoicacid; n-tetradecanoic acid; Vitamin A aldehyde; andEssential oil [8].Seed pods: 3.alpha.-(Trimethylsiloxy) cholest-5-ene; 9-Octadecenoic acid ethyl ester; 11, 14-Eicosa-dienoic acid; 13-Tetradecenal; Hexadecanoic acid;Docosanoic acid; Linoleic acid ethyl ester; and Tet-radecanoic acid [8].Medicinal Activity:1. Anti-epileptic:Rajput et al., 2017 [12] researched in a strychnine-induced seizure model, the anti-epileptic activityusing oral dosage of ethanolic Nelumbo nucifera fruitextract was assessed in rats of 5 groups (7 rats pergroup) everyday for a period of 15 days. In com-parison to the control group, it was discovered thatfruit's ethanolic extract at a certain dose significantlydelayed the seizures' onset. However, the durationand intensity of the seizures increased anddecreased, respectively, thereby improving thesurvival rate of the rats by 42.85%in comparison tothe outcome of diazepam-reference drug. The re-sults showed that this extract has beneficial anti-epileptic action, but to validate these outcomesfurther innovative research, in a large number ofanimals is required.2. Anti-viral:W.-K Cho et al., 2022 [13] conducted a study onRAW 264.7-TIB-71 Macrophage cell line and testedthe 100 mg/ml concentration of Nelumbo nuciferaTable 1. Taxonomic classification [2].Kingdom PlantaePhylum SpermatophytaSubphylum AngiospermaeClass DicotyledonaeOrder NelumbonalesFamily NelumbonaceaeGenus NelumboSpecies nuciferaINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES 2023;12:58e65 59water extract of leaf. The neuraminidase and hem-agglutinin activities of Influenza A Virus (IAV) wereboth significantly suppressed by Nelumbo nuciferaleaf water extract, which also boosted viability of cellby averting the cytopathogenic effects of H3N2 &H1N1 IAV infection. The outcomes implied that IAVinfection was significantly inhibited by Nelumbonucifera water extract of leaf and this extract mightbe formulated as a natural anti-viral drug that canprevent influenza viral infection.3. Anti-cancer:Wu et al., 2017 [14] conducted a study in which itwas discovered that MDA-MB-231 & 4T-1 breastcancer cells had much less migration when exposedto (NLE) Nelumbo nucifera extract of leaf and (NLPE)Nelumbo nucifera polyphenol extract of leaf. RhoA,Rac1, and Cdc42 expression was reduced in thepresence of NLE and NLPE, it also inhibited p38MAPK and ERK activation. Furthermore, NLPE andNLE treatment dramatically decreased in vivo lungmetastasis of breast cancer and protein kinase C aactivation. Overall results displayed the affect ofNLPE and NLE on migration of breast cancer cell,indicating its future usage as chemo-preventivemedicines to stop the spread of the disease.Another study [15] displayed that the results, incomparison to the control group, rats given NLEhad significantly lower levels of serum aspartateamino transferase, alanine amino transferase, andalbumin, all of which are signs of hepatocellularinjury. NLE reduced DEN-induced oxidative stress,accompanied by a dip in lipid peroxides and a risein the activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase,glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutasein liver tissues. In NLE-administered rats, the non-enzymatic antioxidants’ status, such as reducedglutathione, was discovered to be elevated as well.In addition, when compared to the DEN-only group,NLE reduced tumour growth, hepatic GSTp, PKCa,and Rac1 expressions. NLE supplementation there-fore lessened the harmful effects of liver cancer. Theabove mentioned results displayed that NLE pre-vents carcinogenic effects on liver brought on byDEN therapy by inhibiting hepatic cell oxidativestress, lipid peroxidation, and boosting the anti-oxidant defence mechanism.Chen et al., 2014 [16] assessed the antiradicalscavenging, ferric reducing power assays and metalchelating to determine the anti-oxidation activity ofchemicals isolated from Nelumbo nucifera leaves. Theoutcomes demonstrated the antioxidative action ofthese substances. Additionally, the study looked athow well the extracted phytochemicals repressedthe growth of human melanoma, gastric, and pros-tate cancer cells and according to the results, mel-anoma, stomach, and prostate cancer cells weresignificantly prevented from proliferating by 7-hydroxydehydronuciferine. All of these results pointto the Nelumbo nucifera leaves as a reliable source ofphysiologically active compounds with anti-oxidantcharacteristics.4. Anti-microbial:According to Kumar et al., 2011 [17] research re-sults, Nelumbo nucifera's methanolic extract exhibitedcomparable anti-bacterial activity against referencestandards at 150 mcg/ml concentration on Staphy-lococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcusluteus, Bacillus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiellapneumonia. This extract concentration might beemployed in alternative medicine to avert the pro-gression of numerous diseases. Additionally, basedon the needs of the treatment, these data may helpin creating appropriate dosage forms like lotion,ointment, and cream.5. Anti-inflammatory:According to Rajput et al., 2021 [18], whencomparing control to the Nelumbo nucifera ethanolicfruit extract, the extract significantly reduced pawinflammation and edema level in Wistar rats givencarrageenan at all doses (third to the fifth hour). Thismakes it a valuable treatment option for people withchronic inflammatory diseases. However, to sub-stantiate these findings, additional preclinical andclinical testing is needed.According to Cho et al., 2012 [19], by preventingNO generation in RAW 264.7 cells that have beentriggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), extracts fromNelumbo nucifera leaves displayed anti-inflammatoryproperties. The expression of the induced nitricoxide synthase protein was inhibited in order toachieve this suppression of NO generation.Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine linkedto an inflammatory response, was shown to beinhibited by Nelumbo nucifera leaf extracts whichsuggests that addition of leaves extract of Nelumbonucifera in oral formulations will work well to avoidperiodontal disorders or treating the same.6. Anti-hyperlipidemic:According to the study conducted by S. Liu et al.,2013 [20], Nelumbo nucifera leaf flavonoids (NLF)effectively inhibits -glucosidase, -amylase, and PPL.Furthermore, NLF have high lipid-lowering effect,which was proven by the reported therapeutic60 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES 2023;12:58e65effects of NLF against experimentally inducedhyperlipidemia in rats. These results authenticatedtraditional knowledge that implied that these fla-vonoids may provide a supplementary strategy forthe management and treatment of hyperlipidemia.A study conducted in recent years [21] revealed anadditional proof that lotus stamen could be utilisedas an alternate therapy for dyslipidemia. 30 patientswith hyperlipidemia were placed into two groupsfor a 4-week randomised, controlled interventionalstudy: the oral lotus stamen tea group, and thecontrol group. The study chose to provide theintervention for 4 weeks while monitoring the sub-ject at the 2nd and 4th weeks. However, this paperpresented early study findings that indicated lotusstamen tea could lower both LDL and total choles-terol levels in blood following a 2-week interven-tion. Blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levelsdid not change, and there were no adverse effects orabnormal renal or liver function as a result of thisintervention. Additionally, blood liver enzymelevels and blood renal function did not change.7. Anthelmintic:Yen et al., 2014 [22] study was the first to identifyNelumbo nucifera's anthelmintic properties againstHymenolepis nana. Thus, we discovered that apor-phines and oxoaporphines, respectively, had radicalscavenging action against peroxyl radical in additionto their cestocidal activity for H. nana. Therefore,while having radical scavenging properties, thosecompounds nevertheless had cestocidal actionagainst H. nana. These findings may prove helpful inthe research for naturally occurring anthelminticsthat are more effective.8. Anxiolytic & Anti-depressant:Khan et al., 2017 [23] study displayed that theNelumbo nucifera fruit has anxiolytic and anti-depressive properties, and it's possible that this isbecause both the seed pods and the seeds areabundant in important phytochemical componentsincluding alkaloids and flavonoids. Furthermore,the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects of Nelumbonucifera fruit were substantially comparable to thoseof Imipramine and Diazepam. Further research isrequired in this area due to Nelumbo nucifera fruit'ssignificant potential for aiding in the treatment ofCNS diseases like anxiety and depression.9. Anti-cariogenic:Lee et al., 2019 [24] study examined the anti-cari-ogenic effect of Nelumbo nucifera leaf extract (NLE)against nine different kinds of oral-disease causingbacteria. The anti-cariogenic activity of NLE in allnine species of bacteria, including S. mutans, theactivation of GTase was suppressed by at least 50%.The leaf extract was found to have 85% GTase ac-tivity inhibitory impact on S. anginosus. According tothe study results, a concentration of NLE exhibitedpotent growth, GTase activation, and acid genera-tion inhibitory effects. The study results displayedthat NLE has anti-cariogenic properties against theoral bacteria causing dental caries. After conductingadditional research in the near future, NLE can thusbe used as an anti-cariogenic product.10. Analgesic:Rajput et al., 2019 [25] assessed Nelumbo nuciferafruit (NNF) extract's central analgesic activity in miceby both the acetic acid-induced writhing test & thetail-flick test, which showed that NNF extract hadexcellent analgesic effect that was comparable toaspirin. This suggests that both the seeds and thepods, whichmake up the two segments of NNF, seemto be rich in saponins, flavonoids, and tannins. NNFextract thus appears to have a considerable potentialin the treatment of conditions linked to pain, and re-quires additional experimental research in this area.11. Vasorelaxant:Gong et al., 2020 [26] with the use of porcine coro-nary arteries, examined the vasorelaxant effects ofNelumbo nucifera extract along with its underlyingmechanisms. The vasorelaxant properties of extractsfrom four different Nelumbo nucifera sections i.e. spo-nioderm, seed, leaf and flower extracts were exam-ined. Of them, Nelumbo nucifera spornioderm (NNS)extracts demonstrated the most potent endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. The vasorelaxation actionof NNS was greatly decreased by inhibitors of endo-thelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphoinosi-tide 3 kinase (PI3K), and soluble guanylyl cyclase(sGC), but was unaltered by inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase and EDHF. In endothelial cells, NNScaused concentration-dependent phosphorylation ofeNOS. Overall, the research showed that NNS is aneffective endothelium-dependent vasodilator thatworks through the PI3K-eNOS-sGC pathway. Thisresearch revealed NNS as a promising herbal optionfor the treatment of CVD linked to atherosclerosis andendothelial dysfunction.12. Anti-coagulant:Ramya et al., 2017 [27] studied that in comparisonto other concentrations of 0.25 g/ml, 0.125 g/ml, andINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES 2023;12:58e65 610.062 g/ml, the leaf extract concentration of 0.5 g/mlhad the greatest effect with respect to all of thetested extracts. As a result, Nelumbo nucifera leafextract in various concentrations of methanol,ethanol, and ethyl acetate prevents clot formationand raises prothrombin time in a dose-dependentmanner, which may be due to the existence of ste-roids, flavonoids, and tannins in it. Nelumbo nuciferaleaf extract has pharmacologically active anti-coag-ulant components, according to the results of invitro studies on the topic, which may be useful inpreventing blood clotting disorders. As a result,Nelumbo nucifera leaf may be employed as an alter-native source of natural anti-coagulant in the futureafter more research regarding the same isconducted.Rajput et al., 2019 [28] performed a study in which35 male Wister rats were divided evenly into 5groups for the anti-coagulant assessment. The re-sults indicated that Nelumbo nucifera fruit (NNF)extract 200 mg/kg greatly increased prothrombintime and thrombin time while dramaticallylowering fibrinogen levels in comparison to control.Without influencing the other coagulation parame-ters, such as the activated partial thromboplastintime, prothrombin time, or thrombin time, NNF100 mg/kg also dramatically decreased the fibrin-ogen level when compared to the control. NNFdisplayed potent anti-coagulant activity, and canpossibly be explained by its effect of inhibition onthromboxane A2 production and the activation,adhesion, and aggregation of platelets. Neferine, analkaloid, along with various flavonoids present inthe extract may be the cause of its anti-coagulanteffect which may be useful in doctoring differentatherosclerotic and thrombotic conditions, howeverfurther studies are required to establish theseresults.13. Hepatoprotective:Wang et al., 2019 [29] study outcomes showed thatthe recently advanced technique was successfullyused to evaluate the defensive function of lotus leaf,also exploring the prospective lotus leaf hep-atoprotective mechanisms. According to the data,lotus leaf actively defended the liver from damagebrought on by Genkwa Flos by controlling themetabolism of various amino acids, sphingosine,and LPC. In addition, lotus leaf's anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-regulating properties wereclosely linked to its hepatoprotective effects. Thisstudy may help to disclose the lotus leaf's defencemechanism and find several clinical applications forit with further studies.14. Anti-obesity:Ono et al., 2006 [30] researched the pharmaco-logical basis of Nelumbo nucifera leaf extract's (NNE)anti-obesity activity. Using mice that had been givena high-fat diet and NNE treatment for five weeks,the efficacy of NNE on the activity of digestive en-zymes, lipid metabolism, and theromogenesis wasobserved, along with efficacy in preventing obesity.Mice with high-fat diet induced obesity were givenNNE, which stopped the liver triacylglycerol levels,parametrial adipose tissue weight, and body weightfrom rising. When mice were given NNE andexercised, skeletal muscle UCP3 mRNA expressiontended to be higher. As a result, NNE hampereddigestion, increased energy expenditure, sped upthe metabolism of lipids, and prevented the ab-sorption of carbohydrates and lipids. NNE istherefore advantageous for the prevention ofobesity.Ahn et al., 2013 [31] investigated on anti-obesityactivity concentrated on two distinct pathways, i.e.fat absorption and fat storage. As the best methodof treating obesity, a combination of these pro-cesses is preferred. The varied components ofNelumbo nucifera leaves allow for a variety of ac-tions. The results showed that the benzoisoqui-noline alkaloids prevented the absorption andstorage of fat. While flavonoids were better atpreventing fat storage, other alkaloids and meta-stigmanes were better at preventing fat absorp-tion. As a result, Nelumbo nucifera leaves may havesynergistic effects in the management of obesity byjointly limiting fat absorption and fat formationand they may be used to treat obesity sincethey prevent pancreatic lipase and adipocytedifferentiation.15. Anti-neurodegenerative:Jung et al., 2015 [32] studied BACE1 and ChEsinhibition through bioactivity-guided fractionationand isolation study of Nelumbo nucifera embryoswhich revealed that the major compounds vitexin,liensinine, and neferine, along with the minorcompounds northalifoline and quercetin-3-O-glucoside, imparted significant BACE1 and ChEsinhibitory effects, and ONOO- scavenging effects,proposing their prospective role in treating Alz-heimer's Disease. For the first time, the extractedcompounds' AChE and BACE1 inhibitory actionswere compared. The results of this investigationshowed that by reducing oxidative stress, thesesubstances may have therapeutic or preventativeeffects on Alzheimer's Disease.62 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES 2023;12:58e6516. Anti-aging:Kim et al., 2011 [33] investigated the water extractsof flower, seed, leaf, stem, and root from Nelumbonucifera for their functional cosmetic effects. All ofthe Nelumbo nucifera extracts met the requirementsfor cosmetic use. The seed and flower extracts fromNelumbo nucifera displayed such strong anti-oxidantproperties that the concentration for each extractwas 5 mg/ml to show 50% inhibition. The seed,flower, and leaf extracts of Nelumbo nucifera dis-played DOPA-oxidase inhibitory effect of 57%, 59%,and 50%, respectively, compared to arbutin's 44%.At 200 mg/ml, The seed, flower, and leaf extracts ofNelumbo nucifera demonstrated 54%, 56%, and 49%elastase inhibition, respectively, whereas adenosinedisplayed 26% inhibition. Also, no skin irritationwas observed in the volunteers who were tested forskin irritation with water cream containing Nelumbonucifera's 1% leaf, stem, flower, and root extract and4% combined extracts. It was concluded that theseed and flower extracts of Nelumbo nucifera havesignificant anti-wrinkle potential for cosmeticproducts.Kim and Moon, 2015 [34] studied lotus seed tea'sskin protective property against UVB irradiation onhairless mouse model divided into two groups i.e.control group and lotus seed tea group for sixmonths. Both groups received UVB exposure for anadditional three months after the initial six monthsof treatment. The skin moisture content and biopsy-based morphological and histological investigationswere done both during and after the administration.There was no discernible change between the skinmoisture content of the control group and the lotusseed tea group before UVB irradiation (P < 0.05).However, following the UVB treatment, significantmodifications were seen. When compared to thecontrol group, the lotus seed tea group clearlydemonstrated skin protection. The consumption ofthe lotus seed tea boosted UVB exposure protection,as evidenced by various tests in the study. As aresult, drinking lotus seed tea regularly has theimpact of stopping the skin moisture loss, reducingthe abberant keratinocytes' development, andassisting in the inhibition of protein oxidation.17. Anti-oxidant:Chunyun Zhang et al., 2017 [35] did a studyNelumbo nucifera seed embryo and observed that theseed embryos had less overall flavonoid contentthan lotus leaves. Compared to lotus leaves' flavo-noid O-glycosides, lotus seed embryos’ flavonoid C-glycosides displayed stronger anti-oxidant effectssuggesting that lotus seed embryos may become apotential source for antioxidants.18. Immuomodulatory:D. Mukherjee et al., 2010 [36] studied the totalleukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, theneutrophil adhesion test, the phagocytic response,the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction and thenitroblue-tetrazolium reduction test on swiss albinomice to assess the immunomodulatory activity ofthe plant's seed and rhizome extracts and it wasobserved that both the extracts modulated variousimmunological parameters, thereby stimulating thedefense system.2. Toxicity StudiesP. Kunanusorn et al., 2011 performed a research toevaluate the safety of Nelumbo nucifera stamensextract an acute and subchronic oral toxicity studieswere performed on SpragueeDawley rats for 90days. Nelumbo nucifera stamens extract's oral fataldose for female and male rats was found to begreater than 5000 mg/kg, while the extract's no-.observed-.adverse-.effect level for rats' both sexeswas thought to be 200 mg/kg/day [37].3. ConclusionThe review focuses on geographical distribution,phytoconstituents, pharmacological activities, andtoxicology of the Nelumbo nucifera. There are variedPharmacological applications of the herb like anti-epileptic, anti-viral, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anthelmintic, anxiolytic & anti-depressant, anti-cariogenic, analgesic, anti-coagu-lant, anti-neurodegenerative, anti-aging, andimmunomodulatory, etc. It also exhibits musclerelaxant, anti-aging & anti-wrinkle applications dueto the plant having vasorelaxant & anti-oxidantproperties and can be utilized in some tonics orserum and facial creams. Other than the plant beinga source for treatment for various diseases, it is alsocooked as a curry and side dish with meals in Asiancountries. The plant Nelumbo nucifera needs morein-depth research for its use on scientific lines.Source of supportNone.Conflicts of interestNone.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND ALLIED SCIENCES 2023;12:58e65 63References[1] Sheikh SA.
