The aim of this study was to update a review publishedin 2016 by including the studies that were carried out in the period 2016–July 2021 on about 120Ecuadorian medicinal plants. Relevant data on raw extracts and isolated secondary metabolites wereretrieved from different databases, resulting in 104 references. They included phytochemical andpharmacological studies on several non-volatile compounds, as well as the chemical composition ofessential oils (EOs). The tested biological activities are also reported. The potential of Ecuadorianplants as sources of products for practical applications in different fields, as well the perspectives offuture investigations, are discussed in the last part of the review.Keywords: medicinal plants; Ecuador; traditional uses; phytochemistry; biological/pharmacologicalactivities; ethnobotany1. IntroductionThe geographic location of Ecuador, together with its geological features, makes thecountry’s biodiversity one of the richest in the world. Ecuador is, indeed, consideredamong the 17 megadiverse countries, accounting for about 10% of the entire world plantspecies, and every year new plants are discovered and added to the long list of the speciesalready known. This fact makes Ecuador an invaluable source of potentially new naturalproducts of biological and pharmaceutical interest, such as carnosol, tiliroside [1], anddehydroleucodine (DL) [2]. Moreover, most plants are considered to be medicinal, wherethey are a fundamental part of the health systems of several Ecuadorian ethnic groups [3].The knowledge of traditional healer practitioners has been maintained over hundreds oreven thousands of years [4]. Therefore, herbal remedies have gained acceptance thanks tothe apparent efficacy and safety of plants over the centuries [5]. As a result, several doctors,especially in government intercultural health districts, practice integrated forms of modernand traditional medicine nowadays.Scientific evidence of the therapeutic efficacy and absence of toxicity in Ecuadorianmedicinal plants and their products has started to be collected only in the last few decadesby the researchers of several groups in different Ecuadorian Universities. This scientificactivity has increased dramatically in recent years, thanks to the support of the Ecuadorianpeople and government authorities, who consider the sustainable use of biodiversityresources a possible source of economic wealth.This review gives a comprehensive analysis of recent phytochemical and biologicallyoriented studies that were carried out on Ecuadorian medicinal plants and is focused onthe potential relationships between traditional uses and pharmacological effects, assessingthe therapeutic potential of natural remedies. This review completes the information thatwas provided by our group in 2016 [3]. Since then, more than 100 scientific articles havePharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14111145 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticalsPharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 2 of 41been published concerning phytochemical and pharmacological studies of more than 120plants belonging to 42 different botanical families. In addition, a few naturally derivedproducts have been patented [6]. Moreover, traditional natural preparations, such as Coladamorada, which is consumed on the Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos) [7], and Horchatalojana, which is a typical beverage that is made of a mixture of medicinal and aromaticplants consumed by the people of southern Ecuador [8–10], have received great attention.Other typical preparations are an infusion of guaviduca from Piper carpunya Ruiz & Pav. [11],which is a traditional drink of the Amazonian people, and the infusion of Ilex guayusa Loes.,which is an emblematic tree of the Amazon Region of Ecuador that is widely used in folkmedicine, ritual ceremonies, and for making industrial beverages [12,13].Many of the scientific articles mentioned in this review refer to studies that werecarried out on plants and traditional preparations from southern Ecuador, especially fromthe province of Loja (Figure 1), which has a long tradition in exporting medicinal plantsof great importance for human health, such as quina (Cinchona spp.) and condurango(Marsdenia condurango Rchb.f.).Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 56   information that was provided by our group in 2016 [3].

MolleTo alleviate toothache and laborpain; as an anti-inflammatory,antiviral, antiseptic, antifungal,analgesic remedy; and to treat asupernatural ailment known bynative people as “bad air.”The essential oil (EO) was rich in p-cymene(40.0%), limonene (19.5%), myrcene (7.7%),and camphene (5.6%) [14].The EO exhibited an important acaricidal effect: at a concentrationof 2%, it was lethal to R. sanguineus larvae [14].AnnonaceaeAnnona montana M. Guanabana de monte orguanabana (false graviola)The plant is used to treat lice,influenza, and insomnia;immature fruits are used to treatdysentery.Organic extracts showed genotoxic damage to DNA and cellantiproliferative activity against several human tumor cell lines.The highest activity was observed for the ethyl acetate extract, withthe following percentages of inhibition: lung cancer A549 (97 ±1.7%), cerebral astrocytoma D384 (98 ± 3.2%), breast carcinomaMCF-7 (93 ± 4.5%), prostate cancer PC-3 (99 ± 6.8%), and coloncancer RKO (96 ± 5.7%). The IC50 values were 9.6, 7.9, 6.0, 13.1, and7.7 µg/mL, respectively, for each tumor cell line [15].AmarryllidaceaeCrinum × amabile DonnLirio de araña púrpura (purplespider lily) or lirio de arañagigante rosada (pink giant spiderlily) in the Ecuador continent andlirio de cinta in the GalapagosIslandsIt is used in the Esmeraldasprovince to treat hemorrhoids.Alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, andcarbohydrates were determined as the maincompounds in leaves and bulbs usingphytochemical screening [16].The anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities were evaluated usingisolated neutrophils and the tetrazolium salt method (WST-1),respectively [16].Phaendranassa brevifoliaMeerowPhaendranassa cinereaRavennaPhaendranassa cuencanaMinga, C.

Docking studies indicated that cantabricine (1)(Figure 2), which is an alkaloid present in most species underinvestigation, was active on both enzymes. However, thiscompound was not present in the extracts of the two plants thatexhibited the highest in vitro inhibitory activity, namely, P. cuencana(IC50 = 0.88 ± 0.11 µg/mL) against AChE and P. dubia (IC50 = 14.26± 2.71 µg/mL) against BuChE; instead, the two species were rich ingalanthamine-type alkaloids [17]. The alkaloid profiles of P. dubiaand P. brevifolia bulbs were investigated and significant inhibitoryactivities on both enzymes were determined [18]. The IC50 values ofthe activity against AChE were 25.48 ± 0.39 and 3.45 ± 0.29 µg/mL,respectively, whereas the IC50 values against BuChE were 96 ± 4.94and 58.89 ± 0.55 µg/mL, respectively. A high content oflycorine-type alkaloids was found in both species [18].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 10 of 41Table 1.

No activitywas reported on α-amylase, whereas the percentages ofα-glucosidase inhibition were significant only at the highconcentrations of 500 and 1000 µg/mL, with values of 73.02 ± 0.2and 91.0 ± 1.0%, respectively. The IC50 values (µg/mL) of theantiradical and antioxidant activities, as determined using2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), showed that the Trolox (awater-soluble derivative of vitamin E) equivalent antioxidantcapacity (TEAC) and the β-carotene-linoleic acid model system(β-CLAMS) assays were 31.6 ± 0.2, 23.0 ± 1.93, and 43.1 ± 0.81,respectively [19].ApocynaceaePrestonia mollis Kunth Bejuco de cancer Anticancer, wound healing, anddisinfectant remedy. The plant showed no significant antioxidant and antiradical effects [20].Prestonia spp. Chicle (gum) To treat skin affections. Alkaloids, saponins, and flavonoids wereidentified as the main phytochemicals [21].AquifoliaceaeIlex guayusa Loes. GuayusaWidely used in the Amazonregion of Ecuador in ritualceremonies; moreover, thetraditional use for treatingvarious ailments and diseaseswas well documented by severalrecent reviews [22].The content of polyphenols, alkaloids, andthe health benefits of a tea drink preparedwith guayusa leaves together with beveragesfrom other Ilex species was discussed [23].The optimization of the ultrasound-assistedextraction of phenolic antioxidants from theleaves using response surface methodologywas described [24].Strong inhibition of the enzyme hyaluronidase indicated aninteresting anti-inflammatory activity; however, no antibacterialeffects were observed from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli[25]. In an attempt to validate the traditional use of guayusa andalfalfa for the treatment of female infertility, the estradiol levels inblood samples were measured after administration of the plants torats, which showed high in vivo estrogenic effects [26]. Amethanolic extract of guayusa exerted a significant inhibitory effecton α-glucosidase (IC50 value = 176.5 ± 1.50 µg/mL), while it wasinactive against α-amylase. In antiradical and antioxidant assays,the IC50 values (µg/mL) were 14.2 ± 0.99, 11.8 ± 1.01, and13.0 ± 0.85 in DPPH, TEAC, and β-CLAMS assays, respectively.Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 11 of 41Table 1.

Thediterpene carnosol (30) (Figure 6) exhibited high activityagainst the “blast disease” that is caused by the fungusPyricularia oryzae [61]. The minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC)values of carnosol (30) against this fungus were very close tothose of the well-known pesticide flutriafol [61]. Moreover,carnosol (30) showed a promising selective inhibitory activityof the enzyme BuChE (5.15 M, in comparison with8.568 ± 0.570 M of the positive control donepezil) [1].Lepechinia paniculata(Kunth) Epling Yayllon or llanllum in KichwaThe buds are tied at theforehead for treating the“mal de aire”, a sort of evileye, and against headache,while flower infusions areused to treat nervousdiseases.Column chromatographic separation of the leaf EtOAcextract afforded ledol (28), (−)-caryophyllene oxide (29),(−)-carnosol (30), and guaiol (34) (Figure 6) [59]. Inanother work, 40 and 29 compounds were identified inthe EOs that were steam distilled from the leaves andthe flowers, respectively. The main components of theoils were 1,8-cineole, β-pinene, δ-3-carene, α-pinene,(E)-caryophyllene, guaiol (34), and β-phellandrene [62].The flower EO showed interesting inhibitory activity againstthe enzymes AChE (IC50 = 28.2 ± 1.8 2 µg/mL) and BuChE(IC50 = 28.8 ± 1.5 µg/mL). By contrast, the leaf EO showedmoderate inhibitory activity against the two enzymes, withIC50 values of 38.2 ± 2.9 µg/mL (AChE) and47.4 ± 2.3 µg/mL (BuChE) [62].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 21 of 41Table 1.

Thirty-four compounds were identified in the EO,accounting for 93.4% of the oil. The main constituentswere δ-3-carene (19.9%), β-pinene (17.0%),(E)-β-caryophyllene (9.7%), and (E,E)-α-farnesene (9.4%)[63].The EO exhibited strong antifungal activity againstTrichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes [63].Melissa officinalis L. Toronjil Relaxant, insomniaThe ethanol extract, which was obtained via macerationof the leaves, was a rich source of essential fatty acidsand derivatives, benzenoids, phytosterols, andpentacyclic triterpenes [64].On the basis of the literature, most constituents identifiedusing GC/MS showed interesting biological activities,including antimicrobial and antitumor properties [64].Ocimum campechianumMill.Albahaca (basil) or albahacablanca (white basil)This plant is used byindigenous population bothfor culinary and medicinalpurposesThe volatile fractions from the methanol and the 70%aqueous ethanol extracts of the aerial parts of the plantwere chemically characterized using GC/MS andHPLC-DAD-MS techniques [65].The EO, the raw extracts, and the main constituents, namely,eugenol and rosmarinic acid, showed significant IC50 valuesin the DPPH and ABTS assays. The EO and eugenol alsoshowed remarkable activity against Pseudomonas syringae pv.syringae and moderate effects against Candida spp. clinicalisolates, with a possible antimicrobial synergy in associationwith fluconazole. The extracts and isolated compounds wereweakly cytotoxic against a HaCaT cell line (keratinocytes) andnon-mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 andTA100 strains, indicating safety. The EO was weakly activeagainst human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells(A549 cell line). This evidence suggests a potential use of thecrude drug, extracts, and the EO as antioxidant agents incosmetic formulations and food supplements. In addition, theEO may also have potential applications in plant protectionand anti-Candida formulations [65].Salvia leucantha Cav. Salvia or salvia morada (Mexicanbush sage or velvet sage)The plant is used intraditional medicine as aremedy to relieve cough,chest, lung, and stomachpains, as well as a gardenplantSix main compounds, namely, 6,9-guaiadiene (19.14%),(E)-caryophyllene (16.80%), germacrene D (10.22%),(E)-β-farnesene (10.00%), bicyclogermacrene (7.52%),and bornyl acetate (14.74%), were identified usingGC/MS and GC/FID in the EO that was steam distilledfrom the aerial parts. Four pairs of enantiomers weredetermined using enantioselective GC/MS on the EO.(−)-Germacrene D and (+)-α-pinene showed the highestee [66].In an in vitro assay, the EO exhibited interesting inhibitoryactivity of the enzyme BuChE, with an IC50 = 32.60 µg/mL,which was the best value that was determined for an oil froma Salvia species. In contrast, the oil was weakly active againstAChE, with an IC50 > 250 µg/mL [66].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 22 of 41Table 1.

Salvia, salvia hoja de flechaTo treat inflammation anddifferent intestinal ailments,fever, influenza, gastritis,cuts, and bumpsThe effects of an ethanolic extract of S. sagittata (SSEE) onprimary cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells (pAECs)were investigated. The cells were cultured in the presence ofdifferent concentrations (1–200 µg/mL) of SSEE for 24 h, andthe cytotoxicity was evaluated using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.SSEE did not adversely affect the cellular viability at anytested concentration. No significant change was observed inthe cell cycle. The anti-inflammatory effects of SSEE onpAECs were analyzed using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as theinflammatory stimulus. Different markers that were involvedin the inflammatory process, such as cytokines and protectivecompounds, were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCRand Western blots. SSEE showed the ability to restore pAECphysiological conditions by reducing interleukin-6 andincreasing heme oxygenase-1 protein levels. Thephytochemical composition of SSEE was also evaluated viaHPLC/DAD and spectrophotometric assays. The presence ofdifferent phenolic acids and flavonoids was revealed,including rosmarinic acid as the most abundant component.SSEE possessed an interesting antioxidant activity, as assessedusing the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) andDPPH assays. In conclusion, SSEE was suggested to havein vitro anti-inflammatory effects. This finding represents theinitial step toward possible scientific support for thetraditional therapeutic use of the plant [68].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 23 of 41Table 1.

Another study demonstrated thevariability of the chemical composition of the EOisolated from Amazonian O. quixos. Forty-sevencompounds were identified using GC/MS and GC/FID,which represented between 97.17 and 99.89% of the oilcomposition. The constituents were grouped in aliphaticsesquiterpene hydrocarbons (33.03–55.89%), oxygenatedmonoterpenes (1.97–39.66%), and other compounds(8.94–47.83%). The main constituents were (E)-cinnamylacetate (5.96–41.65%), (E)-methyl cinnamate(0.38–37.91%), and (E)-caryophyllene (8.77–37.02%).Statistical analysis suggested the existence of two EOchemotypes and a direct correlation between theenvironmental conditions and the chemical compositionof the oils [70].The EO showed moderate antioxidant activity in the DPPHand the FRAP assays. Concerning the oil antimicrobialactivity, the MICs were 0.5 µL/L for Staphylococcus aureus,0.05 µL/L for Bacillus subtilis, 5 µL/L for Escherichia coli,0.05 µL/L for Salmonella enteritidis, 0.5 µL/L for Aspergillusniger, and 0.5 µL/L for Pennicillium citrinum [69]. In anotherinvestigation, the leaf EO was used to predict the termiticidaland repellent effects on termites Nasutitermes corniger using aone-factor response surface methodology design. Thevariable that was analyzed was the concentration of the EO inEtOH at an interval of 0.05–0.3% for the anti-termite activityand between 0.01 and 0.12% for the repellent action. A 100%mortality rate was found at oil concentrations > 0.12%, whilethe effect was 22.2% at the minimum concentration analyzed.Moreover, 100 and 48.9% of the termites were repelled by theoil at concentrations of 0.12 and 0.01%, respectively.Forty-two compounds, 39 of which were identified, weredetected in the leaf EO, which was analyzed using GC/MS.The main compounds were (E)-cinnamyl acetate (36.44%),(E)-cinnamaldehyde (27.03%), (E)-β-caryophyllene (5.21%),and (E)-methyl isoeugenol (4.18%) [71].LecythudaceaeGrias neuberthii J.F.Macbr.

In addition to nicotiflorin (40) from flowers,rutin (41) from flowers and leaves, and artabotryside A(42) from leaves, three novel quercetin glycosides wereisolated: hecpatrin (43) and gaiadendrin (44) from theleaves, and puchikrin (45) from the flowers (Figure 7)[73].The leaf hydroalcoholic extract exhibited antimicrobialactivity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, andEnterococcus faecalis, whereas the flower hydroalcoholicextract was only active against Micrococcus luteus. In strikingcontrast, flavonoid glycosides were weakly active againstbacteria. Moreover, the hydroalcoholic extracts and theflavonoids inhibited the activity of α-glucosidase in adose-dependent manner. Nicotiflorin (40) rutin (41) andgaiadendrin (44) were competitive α-glucosidase inhibitors,while hecpatrin (43) was a non-competitive inhibitor [73].LycopodiaceaeHuperzia brevifolia(Grev. & Hook.)

Mixedwith other plants, somespecies also induce a state oftrance or hallucinations inparticipants inmagical–religious rituals [4].GC/MS analysis of the volatile alkaloidal fractions ledto the identification of a few lycodine-type andlycopodine-type alkaloids (46–50) (Figure 8) in H.compacta, H. columnaris, and H. tetragona. The flavonesselgin (51) and tricin (52) (Figure 8) were isolated fromH. brevifolia and H. espinosana, and tricin (52) was alsodetected in the other five species. The rare serratenetriterpenes serratenediol (53), serratenediol-3-O-acetate(54), 21-episerratene-diol (55), and 21-episerratenediol3-O-acetate (56) (Figure 8) were isolated from H. crassa.In addition, the presence of unprecedentedhigh-molecular-weight alkaloids was determined. Ananalytical UHPLC-UV-MS method for the quantificationof tricin (52) in the extracts of Huperzia plants was alsodescribed [74].The significant AChE and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A)inhibitory activity of the alkaloidal fractions from H. brevifolia,H. compacta, H. espinosana, and H. tetragona may support theuse of these plants to prepare brews that induce psychoactiveeffects in participants in magical–religious ceremonies [4].The unusually high amount of tricin (52) in H. brevifolia and H.compacta is remarkable, where this flavone is considered apotent selective inhibitor of different cancer cell lines and apotential colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent [74].MalvaceaeMalva pseudolavateraWebb & Berthel.Malva sylvestris L.Malva (mallow),malva loca, malva alta, malva lisa,or malva mayorMucolyticThe hexane and the 80% hydroalcoholic extracts of theleaves were analyzed using GC/MS. The phytochemicalcontents of the two species were similar and includedfatty acids, diterpenes and triterpenes, phytosterols, andabundant amino acids [75].The leaf aqueous extracts of the two species showed animportant mucolytic effect, confirming the traditional use.Thus, the two Malva extracts are potential sources of vegetablematerial for research and development of phytotherapeuticproducts with mucolytic and gastroprotective activities [75].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 25 of 41Table 1.

A promisingselective and efficient activity was observed against theMCF-7 cell line (IC50 = 5.59 ± 0.13 g/mL at 48 h), which wasmainly due to the high content of α-bisabolol in the oil. Weakantibacterial effects against Gram-positive andGram-negative bacteria were observed using ahigh-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)bioautographic assay and the microdilution method;trans-nerolidol and β-cedren-9-one were mainly responsiblefor the activity. Equally negligible was the radical scavengingactivity, which was measured using the HPTLCbioautographic and spectrophotometric DPPH tests.

A total of 37, 46,and 38 compounds, accounting, respectively, for 96.5,96.2, and 95.6% of the Fo, Fl, and Fr oils, were identifiedusing GC/MS and GC/FID. Oxygenated monoterpeneswere the main components with percentages of 63.1 (Fo),49.4 (Fl), and 61.9% (Fr), respectively. The mainconstituents of the oils were the monoterpene aldehydesgeranial and neral, the content of which depended onthe phenological development stage of the plant,spanning from 31.1 and 23.6% (Fo), to 23.6 and 17.8%(Fl), and 29.7 and 24.3% (Fr), respectively. The highconcentration of the mixture of the two aldehydes (citral)makes the aroma of colada morada prepared in southernEcuador quite different from the aromas of the samebeverage made in other regions of the country [7].The pleasant aromatic properties and the good in vitroantimicrobial activity of arrayán suggest a plausible scientificexplanation for the use of the plant to aromatize a traditionalbeverage and as a natural anti-infective and anti-yeast agent.The EO may become a novel rich source of the importantindustrial chemical citral [7].Myrcianthes hallii (O.Berg) McVaugh Arrayán or arrayán de Quito As an antisepticThirty-eight compounds were identified in thehydro-methanol extract using ultra-high-performanceliquid chromatography (UHPLC) that was hyphenatedto heated electrospray ionization MS and UV detectors.They included polyphenols and organic acids [79].The hydro-methanol extract showed modest antibacterialactivity against methicillin-resistant andmethicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus andmultidrug-resistant and susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus pyogenes strains, with theexception of E. coli, which was found to be less sensitive.Interestingly, no relevant differences were observed betweenmethicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains.Considering the long-standing use of the plant in folkmedicine, suggesting the relative safety, the mixture of plantpolyphenols has potential interesting bio-medicalapplications as a natural antiseptic agent through theincorporation in new anti-infective biomaterials andnanomaterials [79].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 27 of 41Table 1.

In vivo studies with Saccharomycescerevisiae showed that the oil blocked the oxidation processesin yeast cells and significantly increased the antioxidantmarker enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase(CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in a dose-dependentmanner. In addition, at a concentration of 1.6 mg/mL, the EOincreased cellular viability under H2O2-induced oxidativestress. Thus, the antioxidant ability of ginger EOdemonstrated its potential as a food additive and aphytotherapeutic remedy [103].Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 35 of 414. Conclusions and PerspectivesThe criteria for investigating most of the 120 species cited in this review appeared tobe based mainly on an ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological approach. Indeed, scien-tific evidence has often confirmed traditional uses; however, not rarely, tested biologicalactivities were not strictly related to the traditional uses. On the other hand, plants werenot collected with the aim of including extracts or products in high throughput screeningprograms. This strategy should, instead, be involved in future research projects since itis the only investigational system that is available for discovery programs that addressesthe effects of natural products on selected enzymes and receptor targets emanating frommolecular biology.Essential oils (EOs) were the most frequently investigated products. In general, oilcompositions were fully determined using GC/MS and GC/FID analyses; in addition,the oil enantiomer composition and odorant characteristics were often established. Asregards the biological activities of the EOs, the activity of Renealmia thyrsoidea EO against Es-cherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [102], as well as the antifungal activity of Lepechiniaradula [63], Ocimum campechianum [65], Piper ecuadorense [88], and Piper pubinervulum [90]EOs against Candida and Trichophyton strains, which are common causes of severe formsof candidiasis and dermatophytosis, are of great interest. Moreover, it is important tounderline the strong acaricidal activity of a mixture of Bursera graveolens and Schinus molleEOs [44], the repellent effects of Dacryodes peruviana EO against mosquitoes [45], and theanti-termite properties of Ocotea quixos EO [70].Thus, many EOs have the potential to be used not only as components of new perfumesdue to the pleasing organoleptic properties but also as ingredients in the formulations ofphytocosmetics, as well as antiseptic and insect repellent products. Moreover, essential oilsshould be screened in the future against clinically important bacteria and strains that areresistant to common antibiotics.Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia affecting elderly peopleand it is associated with a loss of cholinergic neurons in parts of the brain. Cholinesteraseinhibitors (ChEIs) delay the breakdown of acylcholine that is released into synaptic cleftsand so enhance cholinergic neurotransmission; thanks to these effects, ChEIs are consideredefficacious at treating mild-to-moderate AD. In this context, the study of EO cholinesteraseinhibitory activity is a relatively new area of research; in particular, the oil mechanisms ofaction have been poorly investigated so far. It is, therefore, of great interest that several EOsdescribed in this review exhibited such inhibitory effects; in particular, the highly selectiveBuChE inhibitory activity exhibited by Clinopodium brownei [58], Coreopsis triloba [35],Myrcianthes myrsinoides [77], and Salvia leucantha [66] EOs is worthy of further studies.Equally interesting is the ChEI activity that was found for the flavonoid tiliroside, thediterpene carnosol (30) [1], and the alkaloids found in a few Phaedranassa species [17,18].Concerning the non-volatile fractions and isolated compounds, the studies were lesssystematic and the compounds that are responsible for many plants’ activities are stillunknown. Isolated compounds belonged to different biosynthetic families, including newones, such as the high-molecular-weight alkaloids occurring in some Huperzia species,whose complete structures are, however, still unknown [4]. Extracts and isolated metabo-lites were subjected, almost routinely, to antiradical, e.g., DPPH, ABTS, and antioxidant(e.g., β-CLAMS and FRAP) assays. These tests are expected and, therefore, of little scientificsignificance for extracts containing phenolic compounds, unless high antioxidant productsmay be developed as phytotherapeutic agents or food supplements with health-promotingactivities through the in vivo reduction of the oxidative stress. In this context, the highantioxidant activities of Baccharis obtusifolia [20], Oreocallis grandiflora [94], and Zingiberofficinale [103] are worthy of note.Oxidative stress induces the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequentinflammation; therefore, the in vitro antioxidant activity of a product is often consideredgood evidence of its anti-inflammatory property. However, a more scientifically soundapproach should require the study of the molecular mechanisms that underline anti-Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 36 of 41inflammatory activities. In this context, the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases(MAPKs) or the release of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, such as COX-2, theinducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukins IL-1β and IL-6, play a majorrole in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders and, thus, serve as significantbiomarkers for the assessment of the inflammatory process. The investigation of the anti-inflammatory effects of Salvia sagittata ethanolic extract [68] is a significant example of suchan approach.Several extracts and isolated compounds that were discussed in this review showedinteresting inhibitory activity of the enzymes α-glucosidase and/or α-amylase. Indeed,pancreatic and intestinal glucosidases are the key enzymes of dietary carbohydrate di-gestion, and inhibitors of these enzymes may be effective in slowing glucose absorptionto suppress postprandial hyperglycemia. In this context, it is significant to mention thatthe extracts and phenolic or flavonoid contents of Gaiadendron punctatum [73], Muehlen-beckia tamnifolia [93], Oreocallis grandiflora [19], and Otholobium mexicanum [56], as wellas trans-tiliroside (22) [53], prenyloxy eriodictyol (92), and rhamnetin (101) [96], showedenzymatic inhibitory activity that was comparable or superior to acarbose, which is a drugthat is currently used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, these results shouldpromote studies on determining whether these hypoglycemic products can become sourcesof new antidiabetic drugs.It is very well known that some of the most used drugs in cancer chemotherapyderive from natural products. In this context, the high antiproliferative effects shownby the extracts of some plants, such as Annona montana [15] and Grias neuberthii [72],against several human tumor cell lines are of great interest. Isolated compounds withpotent in vitro cytotoxic properties include the flavonoid tricin (52) from Huperzia spp. [74],the triterpene ursolic acid (11) from Bejaria resinosa [51], and the sesquiterpene lactonesonoseriolide (6) from Hedyosmum racemosus [48] and dehydroleucodine (5) from Gynoxisverrucosa [2]. The antileukemic properties of dehydroleucodine (5) and some derivativeswere the objects of patents [6]. These findings should stimulate more systematic screeningof the cytotoxic effects of Ecuadorian plants’ metabolites and the investigation of themechanisms of the cell antiproliferative effects.Considering the overall research activities that has been carried out so far in Ecuadoron natural products, it can be concluded that little or scarce attention has been dedicatedto the semi-synthesis of derivatives of isolated bioactive compounds with the aims toincrease their activity, to study the structure–bioactivity relationships, and to explorethe mechanisms of action and the signaling pathways that are involved in the biologicalactivities. Even fewer efforts have been put into the synthesis of new chemical entitiesusing computational approaches (in silico) to model the structures of natural products orto design completely new molecules. Indeed, research activities on these themes should beencouraged because they were demonstrated to be highly successful in the discovery ofnew bioactive compounds.Finally, further studies, including those in vivo, are required to understand the rele-vance and selectivity of biological effects that have only been demonstrated in vitro so far.It is also important for practical applications to know potential acute and chronic toxicities,risks, and side effects of the plant-derived products. In fact, even raw extracts can beused as food additives and therapeutic remedies once the absence of toxicity has beendemonstrated, the contents have been standardized, and the efficacy has been scientificallyshown.In conclusion, this review has clearly demonstrated the great potential of Ecuadorianplants as sources of products for different purposes and applications. Moreover, someguidelines for future research programs concerning possible sustainable uses of localtherapeutic resources were indicated.Ultimately, an important purpose of this paper is to stimulate more extensive studieson the rich medicinal flora of Ecuador.Pharmaceuticals 2021, 14, 1145 37 of 41Author Contributions: Conceptualization, C.A., A.I.S. and J.R.; writing—original draft preparation,J.R., A.I.S., M.S. and C.A.; literature retrieval, A.I.S., M.S., J.R. and C.A.; review supervision andediting, G.V.
