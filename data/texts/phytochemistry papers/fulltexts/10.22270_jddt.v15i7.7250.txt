Medicinal plants have long been used as a source of medicine in almost every society. Many modern medications are made from medicinal plants, which are considered to be abundant sources of traditional medicines. Medicinal herbs have been used for centuries to treat illnesses, preserve food, enhance flavor, and stop disease outbreaks. The biological traits of plant species used worldwide are typically caused by the secondary metabolites that the plants produce. Plant-derived compounds regulate microbial growth in a variety of settings. In this review, we presented a general overview of the therapeutic herbs. Healing with medicinal plants has been around since the dawn of humanity. The relationship between humans and their quest for natural remedies has roots in ancient history, which is well-documented through numerous sources: written records, enduring landmarks, and even ancient herbal medicines Crotalaria pallida, often referred to as the smooth crotalaria, is a type of flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. Crotalaria pallida Aiton. is a species with extensive medicinal characteristics. Traditionally, the plant has been utilized to alleviate joint swelling, reduce fever, serve as a vermifuge, and treat skin ailments. Additionally, the plant and its components are claimed to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. Fresh leaves and dried leaf powder were employed for examining macroscopy, microscopy, preliminary phytochemical screening, and fluorescence analysis of the powdered drug. Keywords: Crotalaria pallida action (Fabaceae), phytochemical constituent, pharmacological activity. medicinal uses  INTRODUCTION  The necessity of substituting some medications because of their adverse side effects is a prime example of the widespread use of plants to treat illness and preserve health. Since ancient times, people have used medicinal plants to cure various diseases; this approach is known as phytotherapy 1. Because medicinal plants include a variety of secondary metabolites, or phytochemicals, that nature can repeatedly manufacture, they have therapeutic benefits. Plants' seeds, bark, roots, leaves, and fruits are the best sources of active metabolites. Consequently, various plants have used these phytochemicals as a defensive mechanism against infections. Since ancient times, phytochemicals have been utilized to cure different illnesses, and they are typically considered safer than synthetic medications 2,4. In contrast to synthetic medications, which are seen to be harmful to both humans and the environment, these herbal products are now seen as a sign of safety. Even though herbs have long been valued for their therapeutic, flavorful, and aromatic properties, their significance was temporarily overshadowed by modern synthetic products. However, people are returning to naturals in the hopes of safety and security now that their naïve reliance on synthetics is over. It's time to market them internationally 5. For a variety of reasons, traditional medical systems are still frequently used. The use of plant materials as a source of medicines for a wide range of human ailments has gained more attention due to factors such as population growth, an inadequate supply of medications, the exorbitant cost of treatments, side effects from several synthetic drugs, and the emergence of resistance to currently used drugs for infectious diseases 5. The plant Crotalaria pallida Aciton, commonly known as “rattle box” in English, is an annual erect herb of about 1.50 m height belonging to the family Fabaceae, which grows gregariously in tropical and sub-tropical regions of India6. The stem produces fiber that is comparable to sunn-hemp. Coffee can be replaced with roasted nuts 6,7. The plant is used as green manure and as a good cover crop in tea, Patel et al.

The plant is used to treat urinary problems and fever, a poultice of the roots is applied to swelling of joints and fever, and its leaves are used as a vermifuge 13,14. The plant is grown as a ground cover and a green manure crop, especially in the inter-rows of rubber trees and coconut palms. Flowers are eaten as a vegetable in Cambodia, where the seeds are roasted and grounded for use as a sort of coffee beverage. The roots are sometimes chewed with betel nuts in Vietnam. In traditional medicine, the plant is used to treat urinary problems and fever, a poultice of the roots is applied to swelling of joints and an extract of the leaves is taken to expel intestinal worms 15. India is home to over 81 species of Crotalaria, with Crotalaria pallida Aiton being one of the more noteworthy ones 16. Most Crotalaria species are used as medicinal agents in India to treat various illnesses 17. The phytochemical constituents are also reported in Crotalaria pallida Aiton include:  Alkaloids, Flavonoids, Phenols, Carbohydrates, Proteins, Steroids, Tannins, Saponins, Gums, and Reducing sugars.

PHYTOCHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS Several classes of phytochemicals, including pterocarpanoids, alkanes, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenes, and fatty acids, have been shown to be present in C. pallida. Below is a discussion of each of these classes:  1 Pterocarpanoids Major pterocarpanoids namely, crotafurans A (5ʹ-(1-Methylethenyl)furo[2ʹ,3ʹ: 9,10]pterocarpan-3-ol=rel-(5bR,11bR)-5b,11b-Dihydro-2- (1-methylethenyl)-6H-furo[2ʹ,3ʹ: 6,7]benzofuro[3,2-c][1]benzopyran-9-ol); crotafurans B (1-(3-Hydroxyfuro[2ʹ,3ʹ: 9,10] pterocarpan-5ʹyl)ethanone=rel-1-[(5bR,11bR)-5b,11b-Dihydro-9-hydroxy-6H-furo[2ʹ,3ʹ:6,7]benzofuro[3,2-c][1]benzopyran-2-yl]ethanone); crotafurans C (5ʹ-(1-Methylethenyl)furo[2ʹ,3ʹ: 9,10]pterocarpan-3,6adiol= rel-(5bR,11bR)-5b,11b-Dihydro-2-(1-methylethenyl)-6H-furo[2ʹ,3ʹ: 6,7]benzofuro[3,2c][1]benzopyran-5b,9-diol); crotafurans D (1-(3,6a-Dihydroxyfuro[2ʹ,3ʹ: 9,10]pterocarpan-5ʹ-yl)ethanone rel-1-[(5bR,11bR)-5b,11b-Dihydro-5b,9-dihydroxy-6H-furo[2ʹ,3ʹ:6,7] benzofuro[3,2-c][1]benzopyran-2yl]ethanone), and Crotafurans E (5ʹ-(1-Methyl-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)-furo [2ʹ,3ʹ:9ʹ10]pterocarpan-3-ol) have been reported from the bark of C. pallida 23. 2 Alkane   Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and Gas liquid chromatography (GLC) studies characterize the n-alkane composition in C. pallida epicuticular wax of Patel et al.                                                                                                                                    Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2025; 15(7):126-133 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                           [129]                                                                                            CODEN (USA): JDDTAO leaves, flowers and seeds and identified twenty-one n- alkanes from C15 to C35. In the leaf wax long chain hydrocarbons, Heneicosane (C19), Tricosane (C23), Tertacosane (C24), Pentacosane (C25), Hexacosane (C26), Heptacosane (C27), Octacosane (C28) Nonacosane (C29) and Hentriacontane (C31) were predominant whereas flowers and seeds exhibited higher values of medium-chained n-alkanes (C17-C27) 24. 3 Fatty acids  Gas chromatography- Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of C. pallida oil revealed the presence of unsaturated fatty acid in greater amount than saturated fatty acids. Arachidic acid (37.99%) and palmitic acid (32.48%) are the most abundant saturated fatty acids whereas in linolaidic acid (10.47%) is reported to be predominant unsaturated fatty acid 25.  4 Flavonoids  isolated a new isoflavones 5,7,4ʹ-trihydroxy-2ʹ-methoxyisoflavone along with some other constituents namely b-sitosterol, lupeol, morin, weighteone, 2ʹ-hydroxygenistein, daidzein and 2ʹ-hydroxydaidzein, taxifolin, naringenin, quercetin-7-O-b-d-glucopyran-oside, and naringenin-7-O-b-dglucopyranoside from the barks of C. pallida.26. Three new flavonoids viz. cropalliflavones A, cropalliflavones B and cropalli-flavones C and two homoisoflavonoids along with six previously known flavonoids diosmetin, luteolin, acacetin-8-C-neohesperidoside, obovatachalone, 5,3ʹ,4ʹ-trihydroxy-2ʹʹ,2ʹʹdimethylpyrano(5ʹʹ,6ʹʹ:7,8) isoflavone and alpinumisoflavone, have been isolated from the seeds of C. pallida 27. 5 Alkaloids   Two more alkaloids, cropallin A, cropallin B have also been reported from C. pallida seeds 27 Usaramine-N-oxide and usaramine alkaloids isolated from the seeds of C. pallida using High Pressure liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) 28. 6 Miscellaneous compounds  Spectroscopic analysis of C. pallida  seeds showed one sesquiterpenoids, (-)-methyldihydrophosphate, six phenylpropanoids namely, ferulic acid, p-hydroxyl ethyl cinnamate, ethyl caffeate, phydroxycinnamic acid methyl ester, 4,4ʹ-bis(1-propenoic acid methyl ester)-3ʹ-methoxydiphenyl ether, and ethyl (E)-3-(4-(4-((E)-3-ethoxy-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)-2-methoxyphenoxy) phenyl) acrylate; one phenolic acid, sonchifolinin B; and one lignin, ethyl (E)-3-[(2R,3R)-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)- 7methoxy-3-ethoxy carbonyl-1-benzofuran-5yl] propenoate 27. MEDICINAL AND TRADITIONAL USES The plant is used as green manure, young seeds are used as food, roasted ripe seeds can be substituted for coffee, stem fiber is used as a material for thread, etc. C. pallida is used as a ground cover and a green manure crop throughout the humid tropics, through on a limited scale. In tea, rubber, and coconut plantations in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, and in cocoa plantations in West Africa, it is used as a green manure and planted in the interrows to reduce erosion. It is one of the oldest green manure crops in Indonesia, but lost popularity because of its susceptibility to diseases and pests 29,31. Up to the 1960s, C. pallida was widely cultivated for soil cleansing and as a green manure crop in the south-earth United States, replacing the more toxic Crotalaria spectabilis Roth. It's useful as a fodder crop as well. However, because the seed can occasionally become poisoned when blended with fodder grains, its usage is no longer advised. The seeds were once used to make a fermented food in west Java. To get rid of the toxic parts, the seeds were cooked for two hours, wrapped in banana leaves, and allowed to ferment for a few days. The blooms are used as a vegetable in Cambodia. In Indochina, roasted seeds are used to make a type of coffee. The roots are occasionally consumed with betel nut in Vietnam. In traditional medicine, C. pallida is used to treat urinary problems. A poultice made of the roots is applied to painful swelling of joints, and an extract of the leaves is taken as a vermifuge. In Laos the plant is used to reduce fever 29,31. CULTIVATION A plant of the lowland tropics and subtropics. Elevation- it has been successfully grown at elevations up to 1,800 miters 32. Rainfall- It grows in a wide range of annual rainfall conditions, from 850 mm to over 3,000 mm, and occurs occasionally in rather dry locations. Temperature- The average annual temperature varies from 16-26°c Succeeds on a wide range of soils, except on peat soils that developed under coarse grass. It is considered well suited to sandy soils and has succeeded in saline conditions in Thailand. It requires a sunny position, growing poorly in shade. Often grown as a green manure, the plant can escape from cultivation and become naturalized. It is reported to be invasive in many areas, where it grows in open and disturbed sites such as pastures, waste ground, roadsides and sand dunes at elevations up to 1,070 miters.   This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby. It is cultivated by seed and the seedling will emerge after 21-30 days after sowing. The germination rate of fresh seeds is higher compared to the stored ones. The 30 cm tall-plants must be topped in order to promote branching 32,34. REPORTED PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY  Here, the several significant pharmacological actions of C. pallida are examined. 1.

Pelegrinietal et al., 2009 reported A novel peptide Cp-AMP with molecular mass 5340Da was isolated from the seeds of C. pallida. The Cp-AMP inhibits the development of Fusarium oxysporum and Proteus sp. a gram-negative bacteria 39. Govindappa et al., 2011a evaluated Ethanol extract showed the maximum inhibition against bacteria and fungi. The minimum microbial concentration (MMC) of ethanol, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts ranged from 0.3-3.2mg/ml for bacteria and 0.6-4.0mg/ml for fungi respectively 36. Ukil et al., 2016 said The fatty acid of C. pallida leaf showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Acinetobacter junii and Escherichia coli with MIC value of 80 ± 0.58, 10 ± 0.25 and 10 ± 0.14 respectively 40. 3. Anti-inflammatory activity  Bulbul et al., 2017 evaluated anti-inflammatory activity by the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test in rats. At both 50 and 100mg/kg doses the carrageenan induced rat paw oedema was greatly reduced 41. Hu et al., 2017 said Cropalliflavone C isolated from C. pallida seeds showed moderate anti-inflammatory activity with IC50 value of 16.07µM. The Cropalliflavone A, Cropalliflavone B, Usaramine-N-oxide, Cropallin A and Cropallin B exhibited weak activity with IC50 value ranging from 45.44 to 78.50 µM while luteolin, usaramine and acacetin-8-C-neohesperidoside were ineffective 27. Weng et al., 2003 reported Thepterocarpanoids, crotafurans A and B isolated from C. pallida inhibited the NO2- accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells with IC50 value of 23.0±1.0 and 19.0±0.2µM, respectively 23. 4. Anthelmintic activity Panda et al (2015a) used ethanol, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and petroleum ether extract of leaves of C. pallida to evaluate anthelmintic activity on Indian earthworms Pheretimaposthuma. Among all the extracts, petroleum ether and ethanol exhibited significant and dose-dependent anthelmintic activity. Compared to standard drug albendazole petroleum ether showed better activity 42. Alam et al., 2014 used The ethanol leaves extract of C. pallida showed dose-dependent decrease in paralysis and death time of Paramphistomumcervicompared to reference drug albendazole 35.  5. Cytotoxic and Apoptotic activity  Hu et al., 2017 examined Flavonoids and alkaloids from the seeds of C. pallida were used to evaluate cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 and CaCo2 cell lines. Cropalli flavone B showed moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cell line with IC50 of 6.77µM while other compounds showed little or no cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and CaCo2 cell lines.27. Dinakar and Govindappa, 2017 studied Low molecular weight proteins (LMWPs) with a molecular weight of against Allium cepa root tips and MCF-7 cell lines respectively. The 14KDa protein exhibited antimitotic properties and apoptotic activity and can be used to prevent the progression of cancer in susceptible individuals 43. Umashanakr et al., 2015 evaluted The compound, coumarin isolated from the endophyte of C. pallida when tested against HeLa cancer cell lines. Coumarin significantly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cell lines with an IC50 value of 0.156µg/ml 44. Patel et al.                                                                                                                                    Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics. 2025; 15(7):126-133 ISSN: 2250-1177                                                                                           [131]                                                                                            CODEN (USA): JDDTAO 6 Anti-HIV properties  Govindappa et al. (2013 investigated Coumarins isolated from the flowers, stems, roots, and leaves of C. pallida by the microwave extraction method. The flower extract having coumarins greatly inhibited the HIV replicating enzymes such as βglucosidase, α-glucuronidase, α-glucosidase, pepsin, reverse transcriptase and protease. The C. pallida coumarins can be a potential drug to control HIV disease 45. Govindappa et al., 2011b examined HIV protease inhibitor activity was determined by pepsin assay using methanol and ethanol extract of different parts (leaf, stem, and flower) of C. pallida. The methanol and ethanol extracts of flower and stem exhibited significant inhibition of pepsin enzyme as compared to standard Pepstatin A 46. 7. Antidiabetic activity  Panda et al., 2015b used The ethanol, n-butanol, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extracts of C. pallida leaves were used to determine the antidiabetic activity in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The extract at 300mg/kg body weight exhibited greater antidiabetic activity on the first, third, fifth and seventh days. The ethanol extract showed highly significant antidiabetic activity while other extracts displayed mild effect compared to standard drug Glibenclamine. The ethanol leaves extract of C. pallida can be a potential antidiabetic drug 47. 8. Analgesic and antipyretic activity  Panda et al., 2015c said Substances that reduce pain sensation are called analgesics. The C. pallida is used extensively by tribal people for treatment of various diseases. Analgesic and antipyretic activity were evaluated on albino mice by hot plate and tail immersion methods and Brewer’s yeast-induced pyrexia, respectively. The ethanol, n-butanol, ethyl acetate, and petroleum ether extracts of C. pallida were used at 100 and 200mg/kg to determine analgesic and antipyretic activity. The ethyl acetate and n-butanol exhibited greater analgesic effect at 200mg/kg than the other two extracts compared to standard pentazocine (10mg/kg). On the other hand, petroleum ether and ethanol leaves extract at 200mg/kg showed significant antipyretic activity compared to standard drug paracetamol (100mg/kg) 48. 9. Anti-proliferative activity  Rumondor et al., 2017 evaluated the the Anti-proliferative activity of C. pallida leaves and seeds extracts by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Four different extracts (ethanol, ethyl acetate, n-hexane and aqueous) were used. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity with IC50 value of 29.67µg/ml. The ethyl acetate extract of C. pallida can be a potential anti-cancer drug 49. 10. Miscellaneous activity  Bulbul et al., 2017 reported Anti-nociceptive activity was evaluated using acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin-induced paw licking teat and tail immersion methods in mice. Acetic acid-induced test at 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg significantly reduced the pain by 37.50% and 47.70% respectively. The ethanol leaves extract of C. pallida greatly inhibited formalin-induced paw licking in mice. The extract at 100mg/kg and produced 40.44% and 27.94% inhibition in the first phase and 50mg/kg body weight produced 48.15%, and 20.37% inhibition in second phase. In the tail immersion test, the ethanol extract caused significant inhibition of pain 64.91% at a dose of 100 mg/kg  41. Kabir et al., 2015 examined In vitro thrombolytic activity of methanol extract of C. pallida exhibited clot lysis effect with 41.81±4.12% compared with standard streptokinase 75±0.09% while sterile distilled water showed negligible clot lysis with 4.8±0.12%. 50.
