Abstract
Plants provide a rich source of lead compounds for a variety of diseases. A novel approach combining phytochemistry and
chemotaxis assays was developed and used to identify and study the mechanisms of action of the active compounds in F.
japonica, a medicinal herb traditionally used to treat inflammation. Based on a bioactivity-guided purification strategy, two
anthranoids, emodin and physcion, were identified from F. japonica. Spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize its
crude extract, fractions and phytochemicals. The crude extract, chloroform fraction, and anthranoids of F. japonica
significantly inhibited CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. Mechanistic studies showed that emodin and physcion inhibited
chemotaxis via inactivating the MEK/ERK pathway. Moreover, the crude extract and emodin could prevent or treat type 1
diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. This study illustrates the applicability of a combinational approach for the study
of anti-inflammatory medicine and shows the potential of F. japonica and its anthranoids for anti-inflammatory therapy.

Introduction
A fundamental feature of inflammation is the migration of
leucocytes from blood vessels to inflamed sites. This leukocyte
migration, termed chemotaxis, is guided by chemokines and their
receptors [1]. Chemotaxis could thus reasonably be a potential
target of anti-inflammatory drugs [2]. CXCR4 (fusin) is a CXC
chemokine receptor which is expressed in all leukocytes,
blastocysts and a variety of cancer cells [3]. On binding to
stromal-derived-factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12, its natural ligand,
CXCR4 initiates a signaling cascade which includes the activation
of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Janus kinase
(JAK), tyrosine kinase (TYK), phosphatases, nuclear factor kappa
B (NFkB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT). Finally, CXCR4 signaling leads to chemotaxis, locomo-
tion, and adhesion [3].
CXCR4 is an essential gene and its deficiency causes embryonic
lethality in mice. It is also involved in the development of
autoimmune diseases, HIV infection, angiogenesis, and cancer
metastasis [4,5,6,7]. The first FDA approved CXCR4 antagonist,
plerixafor/AMD3100, is used to mobilize hematopoietic stem
cells, which are collected for use in stem cell graft in patients with
hematological cancers. Plerixafor was initially developed to
interfere with SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction and shows promise
for HIV infection, cancers and autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis [8]. However, this drug is expensive because
of the difficulty in its total synthesis. There is a demand for the
discovery of new CXCR4 antagonists that are at the same time
cost-effective and potent.
Phytochemicals and their derivatives have been an extraordi-
nary source of lead compounds and therapeutics in drug
development [9]. F. japonica (syn: Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et
Zucc. or Reynoutria japonica Houtt.) is a Polygonaceae plant, which
is widespread across Asia and North America. In recent years, this
plant has received increasing global attention due to its high
resveratrol content [10,11,12]. F. japonica, also known as Hu-
Zhang or Japanese knotweed, is used as Chinese herbal medicine
for inflammation, hepatitis, infection, tumors, hypertension,
bleeding and hyperlipidemia [13,14]. It has also been shown to
inhibit cholesterol ester synthesis [15] and protein kinases [16].
Stilbenes (resveratrol and piceid) [17] and their glycosides [18] and
anthranoids (emodin, physcion, anthraglycoside B, citreorosein,
emodin 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside) [17,19,20] and phenolic sac-
charides [21] have been found in F. japonica. Among these, emodin
has known cathartic, anti-inflammatory [22], anti-cancer, anti-
microbial, diuretic, DNA-binding, and vasorelaxant activities
[23,24,25]; emodin and physcion showed cytotoxicity against
cancer cells [24,26]; and emodin, citreorosein and emodin 8-O-b-
D-glucopyranoside showed phytoestrogen activity [20,27,28]. In
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e27480addition, emodin and physcion appeared to be kinase and
tyrosinase inhibitors [16,29,30]. Further, anthraglycoside B has
been used to treat acute hepatitis and leukocyte reduction [17];
resveratrol and piceid were reported to reduce inflammation,
cyclooxygenase and liver injury and have cancer-chemopreventive
activities [31]; and phenolic saccharides inhibited DNA primase
activity in bacteria [21].
In the present study, a novel approach involving phytochemistry
and chemotaxis, was developed to identify the active compounds
from medicinal herbs and study their mechanisms of action. The
crude extract of F. japonica, which has 2 active anthranoid
compounds, emodin and physcion, was used to illustrate proof of
concept. Based on a bioactivity-directed fractionation and isolation
procedure, we evaluated the anti-chemotactic and anti-diabetic
activities of the crude extract, chloroform fraction and emodin
and/or physcion from F. japonica. We further examined the
underlying mechanisms by which both anthranoids suppressed
chemotaxis. We further showed that F. japonica and emodin could
prevent or treat the development of type 1 diabetes, an
inflammatory disease, in a mouse model. This study demonstrates
the feasibility of this novel combinational approach and shows that
F. japonica and its anthranoids are potential anti-inflammatory
agents.

Preparation and HPLC analysis of crude extract, fractions
and anthranoids from F. japonica
The root of F. japonica was purchased from a local Chinese
herbalist and authenticated by one of our authors and a doctor of
Chinese medicine, Dr. Chih-Kang Chiang. An F. japonica sample
(20 g) was ground and extracted with methanol (200 ml 6 3) to
yield the crude extract. After evaporation, 3.6 g of the crude
extract was re-suspended in 540 ml water and partitioned with
chloroform (1080 ml 6 10), yielding a water fraction and
chloroform fraction (621 mg). The water fraction was partitioned
with ethyl acetate (720 ml 6 5), resulting in a water fraction
(1554 mg) and an ethyl acetate fraction (1225 mg). The high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile of the crude
extracts and fractions was constructed using a RP-18 column
[Phenomenex Luna 5 m C18 (2), 25064.6 mm] at a flow rate of
0.5 ml/min, detected at ultraviolet (UV) 254 nm. The solvents
used for HPLC were: (A) water with 0.05% TFA and (B)
acetonitrile with 0.05% TFA. The solvent gradients for HPLC
were set as follows: (1) 10% B to 50% B from 0 min to 50 min, (2)
50% B to 90% B from 50 min to 100 min, (3) 90% B to 100% B
from 100 min to 110 min, (4) 100% B to 100% B from 110 min to
135 min. Emodin (100 mg) and physcion (40 mg) from the active
chloroform fraction of F. japonica and resveratrol from the crude
extract were identified by comparing their nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), UV and/or mass spectrometry (MS) data with
previously reported data [17,33,34]. The purity of the three
compounds was over 95% as determined by
1H-NMR and HPLC
purification.
Chemotaxis and WST-1 assays
Jurkat cells were pre-treated with crude extract, fractions or
anthranoid compounds for the indicated time. The cells were then
transferred into transwell inserts with a pore size of 5 mm.
Transwell inserts containing the cells were put into a 24-well plate
where SDF-1b or vehicle (PBS) were added to the RPMI medium.
After 4 hours, the cells that migrated to the bottom of the 24-well
plate were quantified using hemocytometry. The migration index
(MI) was defined by the following formula: MI (%) = 100 6
(number of drug-treated cells migrating toward SDF-1b minus
number of drug-treated cells migrating toward PBS)/(number of
vehicle-treated cells migrating toward SDF-1b minus number of
vehicle-treated cells migrating toward PBS). For WST-1 assays,
Jurkat cells (5610
3) were incubated with crude extract, fractions
and anthranoid compounds for 24 hours. After extensive washing,
the cells were incubated with WST-1 for 1 hour and measured at
440 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader.
FACS analysis
Jurkat cells were pre-treated with DMSO vehicle, emodin
(1 mg/ml) or physcion (1 mg/ml) for 1 hour. After washing, the
cells were stained with isotype antibody or anti-CXCR4 antibody
plus FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were
subjected to FACS analysis and results were analyzed using FCS
Express software.
Western blot
Jurkat cells were pre-treated with DMSO vehicle, emodin
(1 mg/ml) and physcion (1 mg/ml) for 1 hour. The cells were
stimulated with SDF-1b for 0, 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Total lysates
of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with the
antibodies against ERK1/2 or their phosphorylated forms. After
stripping, the same membrane was re-blotted with MEK1/2 and
their phosphorylated forms. Proteins were visualized using ECL
kits and detected using ChemiGenius image analysis system
(Syngene, Cambridge, UK). The relative intensities of the protein
bands were quantitated using Syngene GeneTools software.
Drug administration, diabetes measurement and
histological examination
Female NOD mice were intraperitoneally administered with
0.2 ml of PBS, the crude extract (40 mg/kg body weight (BW)) or
emodin (4, 20 and 40 mg/kg BW) of F. japonica, three times per
week, from 4 to 30 weeks of age (prevention model), and the crude
extract (40 mg/kg) of F. japonica, three times per week, from 9 to
30 weeks of age (treatment model) unless indicated otherwise. The
above mice were monitored every week for glycosuria and
glycemia using a Clinistix strip (Bayer) and an Elite glucometer
(Bayer), respectively. Animals with 2 consecutive measurements of
Bioassay-Aided Natural Product Research
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e27480blood glucose over 250 mg/dl were considered diabetic. The
pancreata of NOD mice, aged 12 weeks (except when indicated
otherwise), were embedded in wax, cut into 5-mm sections and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Over 20 islets per pancreas
were examined to determine the severity of insulitis. The number
of islets in each category is presented as a percentage of total islets
observed. Scoring categories were: 0, no insulitis; 1, leukocyte
infiltration around the islets (peri-insulitis); 2, ,50% leukocyte
infiltration (moderate); and 3, .50% leukocyte infiltration (severe
insulitis) [35].
Statistical analysis
Data from three experiments or more are presented as mean 6
standard error (SE). For diabetic incidence, the log-rank test was
used to determine if a group was statistically significant from the
control group. For the other experiments, ANOVA was performed
to determine whether there was a significant difference between
treatment groups and control groups. P values of less than 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Extraction, partition, isolation and identification of two
anthranoid compounds from F. japonica by bioactivity-
guided fractionation and isolation
A novel combinational chemotaxis assay-guided fractionation
and isolation method was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
properties of the medicinal herb F. japonica (Figure 1) as a means to
test the general feasibility of the protocol for the evaluation of the
active compounds in medicinal herbs. Briefly, the root of F. japonica
was ground, and extracted with methanol to yield the crude
extract. The methanol crude extract was reconstituted with water
and sequentially partitioned with chloroform and ethyl acetate,
yielding chloroform, ethyl acetate and water fractions. Finally, two
active anthranoid compounds, emodin and physcion, and an index
compound, resveratrol, were isolated and identified using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and
ultraviolet (UV) methods. NMR spectra of the compounds are

were identical to those published elsewhere [17,33,34]. UV and
MS data also confirmed the identity of emodin, physcion and
resveratrol (Figures S1 and S2). The crude extract, water fraction,
ethyl acetate fraction, chloroform fractions, and compounds of F.
japonica were profiled using high performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) (Figure 2). The presence of emodin, physcion and/
or resveratrol in the crude extract and chloroform fraction was
then further confirmed using UV and MS analysis (Figures S1
and S2).
Effect of crude extract, fractions and anthranoid
compounds of F. japonica on CXCR4-mediated
chemotaxis
Since CXCR4 is expressed in all leukocytes, CXCR4 was
selected as the target molecule in chemotaxis assays. First, we set
up a chemotaxis assay in Jurkat cells, a human leukemia T-cell
line. We found that SDF-1b, the CXCR4 ligand, could induce a
20-fold increase in T-cell migration as compared to vehicle control
(lower panel, Figure 1B).
We then pre-treated Jurkat cells with the crude extract, fractions
and compounds of F. japonica for 24 hours and tested the
chemotactic response of cells to SDF-1b. We found that the
crude extract and chloroform fraction of F. japonica at 10 mg/ml
completely inhibited CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis in Jurkat cells
(Figure 3A). However, the ethyl acetate and water fractions did not
show any significant inhibition (Figure 3A). Based on bioactivity-
guided fractionation and isolation, two active compounds, emodin
and physcion, were isolated and identified from the most active
chloroform fraction (Figure 2, S1 and S2). Resveratrol present in
the crude extract of F. japonica was used as an index compound.
This index compound did not inhibit CXCR4-mediated chemo-
taxis (Figure 3C). In sharp contrast, for the first time, emodin and
physcion significantly suppressed CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). The half maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the crude extract, chloroform
fraction, emodin and physcion of F. japonica were 4.5, 3.8, 1.3 and
2.1 mg/ml, respectively. The viability of cells exposed to a dose of
methanol crude extract, the 3 fractions or the anthranoids of F.
japonica used in this study for 24 hours was over 90% based on
WST-1 assay (Figures 3B and 3D). The data suggest that the
suppression of chemotaxis by the crude extracts, 3 fractions and
anthranoids in this study was not due to cytotoxicity.
To assess whether emodin and physcion were, in fact, the main
active compounds in the crude extract of F. japonica, we compared
the anti-chemotactic activities of the crude extract of F. japonica
(10 mg/ml), the crude extract of F. japonica depleted of emodin and
physcion (9.62 mg/ml), a mixture of emodin (0.27 mg/ml) and
physcion (0.11 mg/ml) in the same ratio and quantity as both in
the crude extract, a mixture of emodin (0.14 mg/ml) and physcion
(0.06 mg/ml), and a mixture of emodin (0.03 mg/ml) and physcion
(0.01 mg/ml). We found that the crude extract of F. japonica
showed similar anti-chemotactic activity to the reconstituted
mixture of emodin and physcion (Figure 3E). Conversely, the
crude extract of F. japonica lacking both emodin and physcion lost
its anti-chemotactic activity (Figure 3E). Overall the data suggest
that emodin and physcion are the major active compounds in the
crude extract of F. japonica that result in inhibition of CXCR4-
mediated chemotaxis, although the existence of other minor active
compounds can not be ruled out.
Mechanistic study of emodin and physcion in CXCR4-
mediated chemotaxis
Inhibition of chemotaxis by emodin and physcion could result
from a decrease in the surface expression of CXCR4 receptors. To
rule out this possibility, both anthranoids were used to treat Jurkat
cells. After one hour, the CXCR4 expression level in Jurkat cells
Bioassay-Aided Natural Product Research
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e27480was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis. No difference was observed in the level of expression of
CXCR4 on the cell surface (Figure 4A) in treated and control cells,
suggesting that emodin and physcion do not act at the chemokine
receptor level.
We subsequently checked the signaling molecules downstream
of the CXCR4 receptor. Mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) are known to function downstream of chemokine
receptors [36]. Therefore, we checked whether emodin and
physcion affected ERK1/2 kinases in the CXCR4 pathway.
Immunoblot data showed that both compounds inhibited the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinase triggered by SDF-1b
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, we examined the effect of emodin and
physcion on MAPK kinase (MEK)1/2, an upstream activator of
Figure 1. Bioactivity-guided fractionation and isolation strategy involving extraction, fractionation, purification and chemotaxis
assays. A. F. japonica root was ground and then extracted with methanol. The crude extract (CE) was reconstituted with water and its bioactivity
tested using chemotaxis assay. The same crude extract was sequentially partitioned with chloroform (Chl), ethyl acetate (EA) and water (H2O). After
reconstitution, the bioactivity of the 3 fractions was further tested. Finally, active compounds, emodin and physcion, were purified from the active
chloroform fraction. The dry weights of the crude extract, fractions and phytochemicals of F. japonica are indicated as percentages of the dry weight
of the raw plant material. B. Chemotaxis assays were used to evaluate the bioactivity of the crude extract, fractions and phytochemicals of F. japonica.
Jurkat cells were used as a bioassay platform to test SDF-1b-mediated migration (upper panel). The cell number of Jurkat cells migrating in response
to PBS vehicle or SDF-1b was counted. Data from 3 independent experiments are presented as means 6 SE (lower panel). Representative pictures are
shown. Scale bar, 200 mm.

MEK1/2. These data suggest that emodin and physcion in F.
japonica suppress CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis and subsequently
inflammation, via inactivation of the MEK/ERK signaling
cascade (Figure 4C).
Effect of crude extract and emodin from F. japonica on
type 1 diabetes
NOD mice spontaneously develop insulitis at the age of 4 to 6
weeks and diabetes at the age of 9 weeks and beyond. To further
evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of the crude
extract of F. japonica on type 1 diabetes, we administered crude
extract of F. japonica to NOD mice from 4 to 30 weeks of age
(prevention model), and from 9 to 30 weeks of age (treatment
model). All NOD mice (100%) treated with vehicle developed
type 1 diabetes from the age of 26 weeks (left panel, Figure 5A).
In contrast, the crude extract of F. japonica had reduced diabetes
by 86% in the prevention model group, and by 75% in the
treatment model group at 30 weeks of age (left panel, Figure 5A).
We also examined the effect of the crude extract on insulitis in
12-week-old NOD mice, as measured by leukocyte infiltration
and islet architecture in pancreatic islets. Preventative-treatment
or treatment after disease onset with the crude extract of F.
japonica dramatically decreased leukocyte infiltration into the
islets and destruction of pancreatic islets (right panel, Figure 5A).
Next, we further tested the prophylactic effect of active
anthranoids on type 1 diabetes. Due to a limit in the quantity
of physcion available, we only tested the prophylactic effect of
emodin, the most active anthranoid in the study, on type 1
diabetes. Like the crude extract of F. japonica,e m o d i nd o s e -
dependently prevented type 1 diabetes in NOD mice as
measured by the reduction in incidence of diabetes (left panel,
Figure 5B), leukocyte infiltration into pancreatic islets and islet
destruction (right panel, Figure 5B).

Discussion
Spectroscopic methods and chemotaxis have been successfully
used individually in the pharmaceutical industry. However, to our
knowledge the feasibility of combining both methods has not been
evaluated, and realization and validation of such a combinational
approach has not been attempted. In this study, these methods were
combined and evaluated as a novel system for the identification and
mechanistic study of the active anthranoids from F. japonica
(Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4). The chemotaxis-aided approach proved to
be simple, straightforward, and highly sensitive. F. japonica has been
previously reported to contain emodin and physcion [34].
Moreover, emodin and F. japonica were shown to be the inhibitors
of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases [16,30,37,38]. We, for the
first time, showed that two active compounds, emodin and
physcion, present in F. japonica plant, could inhibit CXCR4-
mediated chemotaxis in a MEK/MAPK-dependent fashion. More
importantly, this proof-of-concept study suggests that this combi-
national approach could be broadly and efficiently applied for
research and development of anti-inflammatory agents mined from
natural sources and studies in medicinal chemistry.

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e27480Interference with chemokine function is a promising inflamma-
tory therapy [2]. The most well-known examples of chemokine
receptor antagonists are plerixafor, maraviroc and vicriviroc
[8,39]. Plerixafor is a CXCR4 receptor antagonist which assists
in the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells, whilst maraviroc
and vicriviroc are CCR5 receptor antagonists for the treatment of
HIV infection. These chemokine receptor antagonists have shown
potent anti-inflammatory effects on different immune disorders in
different models [8,40]. In addition to receptor antagonists, it is
imaginable that targeting cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules
downstream of the chemokine receptors is an alternative approach
to block the chemokine signaling.
Chemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. Upon
binding to chemokines, these receptors activate G proteins,
tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases and phospholipase
[36,41]. Emodin and F. japonica have previously been shown
to be inhibitors of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases
[16,30,37,38]. Consistent with these previous publications, our
results showed that emodin and physcion, isolated from F. japonica,
inhibited the activation of MEK/ERK kinases, a serine/threonine
kinase family, mediated by CXCR4 in T-cells (Figure 4B).
However, neither of the two anthranoid compounds affected the
expression level of CXCR4 receptor (Figure 4A). These findings
suggest that unlike the receptor antagonists, these anthranoids
target the intraceullar proteins downstream of the chemokine
receptors and may be used as alternative inhibitors of chemokine
signaling. MAPKs are known to modulate inflammatory responses
and are thought to be attractive molecular targets for anti-
inflammatory therapy [42]. The demonstration of inactivation
of MEK/ERK pathway by both these antharnoids makes
them extremely interesting potential natural anti-inflammatory
therapies.
Inflammation is a complex physiological process associated with
a variety of diseases. Research and development of effective anti-
inflammatory agents with distinct mechanisms of action is
important to cure these diseases. F. japonica is known as a
Figure 4. Effect of emodin and physcion on CXCR4 signaling. A. Jurkat cells were incubated with emodin (1 mg/ml), physcion (1 mg/ml) or
DMSO vehicle for 1 h at 37uC. After extensive washing, the cells were stained with anti-CXCR4 antibody or isotype antibody (control), followed by
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. The surface expression level of CXCR4 is shown as logarithmic fluorescence intensity. Data are representative
examples of three independent experiments. B. The cells, with the same pre-treatment as Figure 4A, were stimulated with SDF-1 (100 ng/ml) from 0
to 15 min. Total lysates were analyzed by Western blot with antibody against ERK1/2 (t-ERK1/2) and their phosphorylated proteins (p-ERK1/2) (upper
panel). After stripping, the same membrane was re-blotted with the antibody against MEK (t-MEK1/2) and their phosphorylated proteins (p-MEK1/2)
(lower panel). The ratio was obtained by normalizing the signal of the phosphorylated protein to that of the total protein. C. Working model showing
that the anthranoids, emodin and physcion, inhibit CXCR4-implicated chemotaxis and, in turn, inflammation.

PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e27480medicinal herb for inflammation. Two recent studies showed that
the extracts of F. japonica containing a relatively low dose of
resveratrol had anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in
human [43,44]. These observations raised a possibility that some
compounds rather than resveratrol in the extracts of F. japonica also
had anti-inflammatory activity. Here, we showed that anthranoids
present in the F. japonica extract had anti-inflammatory activity by
inhibiting leukocyte migration (Figure 3). Besides, anthranoids
exhibit a variety of bioactivities, some of which are used clinically.
Sennosides, anthranoids derived from the leaves of plants from the
Senna genus, are currently sold as over-the-counter laxatives for
constipation [45]. Emodin and physcion have been proposed as
anti-tumor agents [24,26] and emodin was used to treat hepatitis
via inhibition of NFkB activation [22]. The fact that F. japonica
crude extract, and its anthranoids suppress CXCR4-mediated
leukocyte migration further supports their traditional use as an
anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore, we showed, for the
first time, that F. japonica and its most active compound, emodin,
could prevent or treat the development of type 1 diabetes, an
inflammatory disease, in a mouse model (Figure 5).
In summary, we combined phytochemical and chemotaxis
techniques to into a platform suitable for the identification and
study of the mechanisms of action of active compounds in
medicinal herbs used to treat inflammation. We showed that F.
japonica and its active compounds, emodin and physcion, suppress
inflammation via inhibition of leukocyte chemotaxis. Therefore, F.
japonica and emodin prevent islet destruction and type 1 diabetes in
NOD mice. Mechanistic study showed that both the anthranoids
and F. japonica inhibit CXCR4-implicated leukocyte migration via
inactivation of MEK/ERK pathway downstream of the CXCR4
receptor. These findings support the claims of the benefits of F.
japonica in the traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and suggest
that F. japonica, may be of use in the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
In addition, the data on the active constituents, emodin and

extract of F. japonica at 40 mg/kg, 3 times per week, from 4 to 30 weeks (prevention), or the crude extract of F. japonica at 40 mg/kg, 3 times per
week, from 9 to 30 weeks (treatment). The cumulative incidence of diabetes in mice, from birth to 30 weeks of age, was monitored (left panel). Mouse
pancreata were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (right panel). The severity of insulitis in the NOD pancreata was scored as described in Materials
and Methods and plotted as stacked histograms (right panel). B. NOD mice underwent the same procedure as described for Figure 5A except that
they received PBS control or emodin (4, 20 and 40 mg/kg), 3 times per week, from 4 to 30 weeks (left panel). Mouse pancreata were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (right panel). The number of diabetic mice (numerator) and total number of mice (denominator) in each group is indicated in
