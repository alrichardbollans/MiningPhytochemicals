 -1- ABSTRACT Orchids are one of the largest and globally distributed plant families. Indone-sia has the most types of orchids, estimated around 20% from the total species across the world. Mainly orchids used as an ornamental plant. This research aimed to elucidate another potential of orchids as possibly for herbal medicine plant. The potential of orchids as herbal medicine has been known for a long time, but there is lack of well-documented research. The research method used in this research is exploration on predetermined research sites that were con-ducted in Mount Tilu, West Java on 2022. Observation data of orchids were collected on the sites and the analysis was carried out in a qualitative descrip-tive approach by describing the data from the research results and compari-sons were made through a literature review. Based on the research results, we found about 31 species from 28 genera consisting of 24 epiphytic orchids and 7 terrestrial orchids in the Mount Tilu Kuningan area, West Java. There are 4 endemic species categorised in Java; Chilochista javanica, Crepidium koordesii, Crepidium junghuhnii, and Taeniophyllum biocellatum.   Copyright: © 2024, J.

Or-chids are plants with a variety of shapes, colours and sizes so that these plants are very popular and are in great demand (Zhang et al. 2018; Ti-wari et al. 2024). Until now the number of orchids in the world is 29,199 species that have been accepted (Govaerts et al. 2017), with several hun-dred new species that have been published every year, for example as many as 370 in 2013 and if estimated, the total number of orchids is about 31,000 species (Joppa et al. 2010). In Indonesia, orchid plants have the most types, namely around one fifth from the total species when com-pared to other types of flowering plants (Kusmana & Hikmat 2015), spread across nations including lowland and upland orchids (Yudaputra et al. 2024).  Generally, the use of orchids is usually used as an ornamental plant. In addition, orchids can also be used as decoration in the form of dried flowers and herbal medicine (De et al. 2014). The potential of orchids as herbal medicine has been known for a long time, but it is not very popu-lar compared to ornamental plants (Sulistriarini 2008).

Chinese society is known for the first-time using orchids as medicine. Then there is India, several countries in the Ameri-cas (Aztecs), Africa (Zulu), Europe (Greece), and Australia (indigenous people and Australian aborigines) also use orchids as medicine (Hossain 2011). The Batak Ethnic Community of North Sumatra (Karo, Sima-lungun, Toba) is known to also use orchids for traditional medicine (Aswandi & Kholibrina 2021).   On the island of Java, it is not known that there are publications that use orchids other than for the cultivation of ornamental plants, even though Java has many types of orchids. In the notes of Chomber (1990), states that the island has about 731 species with 231 endemics with a to-tal spread in the West Java region of 642 species. Mount Tilu, Kuningan is an area in West Java which is known to have the potential to find or-chids. The types of orchids on Mount Tilu had previously been collected by the Kuningan District Environmental Management Agency and the Indonesian Tropical Nature Institute in 2006, but only 5 species of epi-phytic orchids were found (Eria multiflora, Eria junghuhnii, Dendrochilum sp., Pholidota ventriculosa, and Appendicula pendula).    MATERIALS AND METHODS Research Geographical Sites  The research was conducted in the Mount Tilu Region to be precise in Cimara Village, Kuningan Regency, West Java in January 2022. Admin-istratively, the Mount Tilu area is included in Karangkacana District and Cibingbin District. Located in the geographical position S 070 06' 12.2" Figure 1.

Mount Tilu is a group of mountains that has at least three highest peaks, namely Sukmana peak 1154 m, Mount Tilu peak 1076 m, and oth-er peaks that are not known name 1112 m (Figure 2). The area consists of production forest (pine and teak) and secondary natural forest which is still a protected forest. Orchid data collection was carried out in both for-est areas, which are production forest (Gagajahan Route) and secondary natural forest (Datarmuncang Route, Mungkal Bangkong Route, around Curug Manteng).   Figure 2. a). Mount Tilu have mountaintops; b). Secondary natural forest.   Materials The tools and materials used in this research were documentation tools (Sony HX350 pro-summer camera), morphological measuring tools (ruler), GPS Locus Map, environmental parameter measuring tools (soil tester, thermometer, hygrometer, lux meter). The research exploration of orchids species in Mount Tilu were also use any equipment for human safety while tracing the mountain, such as special shoes, hat, special cloths, bag, and stick (Figure 3).

Of all the species found, there are 4 species of orchids that fall into the endemic category of Java, namely Chilochista javanica, Crepidium koordesii, Crepidium junghuhnii, dan Taeniophyllum bicelatum (Table 1).   The results of a comparison of orchid finding data between a 2006 study by the Kuningan Regional Environmental Management Agency (BPLH) and the Indonesian Tropical Nature Institute (LATIN), the spe-cies found today are new species that have never been found before.

This may have occurred due to differences in sampling locations (the research locations conducted by BPLH and LATIN were not specified), the observation area was not wide enough, the length of the study, or the species no longer existed at the study site.   Based on figure 5, of the 32 species of orchids found, the species that had a total count of >50 individuals, Calanthe triplicata (56 individu-als), Crepidium junghuhnii (84 individuals), Dendrobium stuartii (67 individ-uals), Flickingeria angulata (343 individuals), Flickingeria sp. (64 individu-als), Pholidota sp. (60 individuals). In addition, there are also several spe-cies that are found quite a lot like Habenaria reflexa (45 individuals), Aer-ides odorata (43 individuals), Acriopsis liliifolia (32 individuals), and Zeux-ine sp (30 individuals). While the species with the least number of indi-viduals were found among them Ascocentrum miniatum, Chilochista javani-ca, Cleisostoma discolor, Coelogyne speciosa, Coelogyne trinervis, Crepidium koordesii, Geodorum densiflorum, Liparis barbata, Liparis sp, Schoenorcis juncifolia, and Spathoglotis plicata.   Figure 6 shows the plots of orchids found at the study site. The dis-tribution of orchids in the Mount Tilu area mostly tends to be well clus-tered epiphytic and terrestrial orchids, although some species are ran-domly distributed. There are three types of ecological distribution pat-terns of plants, namely clustered, random, and uniform (Borregaard et al. 2009). The distribution of clusters of orchids is caused by the environ-ment that forms a microclimate for orchids to grow and reproduce. Usu-ally at certain locations in an area, there are orchids found in large quan-tities and some are not. This is due to different environmental conditions within an area. The method of reproduction of orchids is also the cause of the clustered distribution pattern. Vegetative propagation of orchids uses  Figure 4. a). Orchids types in the Mount Tilu area; b).

Apart from that generatively, orchids also produce thousands to millions of seeds. The existence of a host tree can catch the distribution of orchid seeds, so they don't fall too far and live close together (Kurniawan & Mustika 2021).    Figure 5. Number of individual orchid species in the Mount Tilu area.   When viewed based on the type of habitat, the proportion of found epiphytic orchids is greater (77%) than terrestrial orchids (23%) (Figure 7). This is because the condition of the host trees in the area has a large diameter with a dense canopy cover. Most of the epiphytic orchids are found in tree crowns, especially in large tree branches and in groups, alt-hough some are found singly. In addition, there are also those found on the main stem such Coelogyne speciosa dan Dendrobium stuartii. For other parts such as the base of the tree or the outermost branches, no epiphytic orchids were found. This is because at the base of the tree the condition is upright 90º making it difficult for the orchid to stick and get a little sun-light because it is blocked by the surrounding vegetation. Whereas the outermost branches will be exposed to high intensity direct sunlight, small branches, and the risk of being exposed to wind is also large, so they are not very suitable for orchid growth (Marsusi et al. 2001). J. Tropical Biodiversity and Biotechnology, vol. 09 (2024), jtbb89174 -7-  Figure 7. Comparison of the types of orchids found based on their habitat type.    The following are the types of host trees used by epiphytic orchids to grow and develop. The host trees found in the study area consisted of 10 species from 9 families (Table 2).  Each of these host trees, most of them have the characteristics of rough skin, cracks, easy to peel, and not too hard. Such tree conditions favour epiphytic orchids to grow. Rough tree bark occurs because the tree is able to hold water and humus in the cracks of the tree bark so that it becomes moist, making it suitable for the growth of orchids because these plants like high humidity. However, the roughness of tree bark is not a reference for the growth of epiphytic orchids, this is because there are several types of orchids that are able to live on smooth tree bark Figure 6. Map of orchid distribution findings in the Mount Tilu area, Kuningan, West Java shown with the grey colour.  J. Tropical Biodiversity and Biotechnology, vol. 09 (2024), jtbb89174 -8- (Bergstrom & Carter 2008; Yulia & Budiharta 2010). Like Vanda tricolor that grows on kedondong, Acriopsis liliifolia on durian trees, and Pholidota imbricata on a banyan tree. The three types of hosts at the study site ap-peared to have fairly smooth tree bark compared to other hosts. Then, the host trees that were found also did not have very dense canopies, so that was in accordance with the statement of Seitske et al. (2001), that orchids like trees that do not have too dense canopies so that the need for light will be fulfilled. In addition, several types of epiphytic orchids were also found on different types of hosts, indicating that these species have a high tolerance for different environments so that they are easy to adapt and grow on several types of hosts.  Table 2. Host tree species of epiphytic orchid habitat.     Based on data on the composition of terrestrial orchids, the number found was very small, namely 8 species (Table 3). The condition of ter-restrial orchids that were flowering at the study site facilitated the identi-fication process at the species level. Although there are many orchids Calanthe triplicata found that are not flowering or in a state of fruiting. In addition to orchids Habenaria reflexa most of them are still in a state of budding, so you need to monitor them for a few days until the flowers bloom. The abundance of individual terrestrial orchids is very high and tends to cluster in one area in particular Calanthe triplicata, Crepidium junghuhnii, Habenaria reflexa, and Zeuxine sp (Figure 1). The clustering of terrestrial orchids in close proximity is due to the presence of stolons in the soil, so that new individuals grow not far from their parents No Family Host Tree Type Orchid Type 1 Anacardiaceae Spondias dulcis Vanda tricolor 2 Dilleniaceae Dillenia sp Aerides odorata       Polystachya concreta 3 Flacourtiaceae Pangium edule Aerides odorata 4 Malvaceae Durio zibenthinus Acriopsis liliifolia 5 Meliaceae Swietenia mahagoni Luisia antennifera       Taeniophyllum bicelatum 6 Moraceae Artocarpus heterophyllus Ceologyne speciosa       Polystachya concreta       Rhyncostilis retusa 7 Moraceae Ficus sp Bulbophyllum sp       Flickingeria angulate       Liparis sp       Pholidota sp 8 Phyllantaceae Bischofia javanica Flickingeria angulate       Luisia antennifera 9 Pinaceae Pinus merkusii Airides odorata       Chilocista javanica       Dendrobium stuartii       Rhyncostilis retusa 10 Verbenaceae Tectona grandis Pholidota imbricata J. Tropical Biodiversity and Biotechnology, vol. 09 (2024), jtbb89174 -9- (Puspitaningtyas et al. 2003). Even so, the spread of ground orchids in a wide scope can also be through seeds.  Table 3. Terrestrial orchid habitat in Mount Tilu area.     The types of terrestrial orchids that are found are mostly in the shade of trees. But there are also orchids Spathoglotis plicata which can live with full light or no shade (Sadili & Sundari 2017), and these orchids are found on river banks with open environmental conditions. If you look at the specific conditions of their habitat, almost all of the terrestrial or-chids that were found grew on soil litter except for Crepidium junghuhnii growing on large rocks (Table 3). The reason for terrestrial orchids be-ing found and growing in soil with weathered litter content is that the source of nutrition for terrestrial orchids completely comes from the soil or litter. Meanwhile, the stone used to grow terrestrial orchids has moss, which causes high humidity, because the water is stored in the moss. Hu-mid conditions will provide good water availability for terrestrial orchids or microorganisms associated with orchids (Tirta et al. 2010).  The richness of orchid species in the Tilu Mountain area cannot be separated from environmental influences such as humidity, temperature, pH, light intensity, and altitude. Measurement of environmental parame-ters was carried out in the time range 07.00-15.00 WIB. Based on the results of the average measurement of environmental parameters, this location is suitable for orchid growth (Table 4).   Table 4. Average measurement results of environmental parameters.   The average results of measuring soil moisture in the study area were 53% and 73% for air humidity. Orchids will grow optimally with 50-80% humidity (Purwanto 2016). The results of temperature measure-ments were 26oC. The ideal environmental temperature for orchid growth is 25-27oC, with a minimum temperature of 21-23oC. Daytime temperature 27-32oC and night temperature 21-24oC (Farokhah et al. 2018). Furthermore, for pH measurements of 5, where the ideal pH for orchids is 5-6 (Naik et al. 2014). For the measurement of light intensity No Types of Terrestrial Orchids Habitat 1 Calanthe triplicata Soil litter 2 Crepidium junghuhnii Soil litter and rocks 3 Crepidium koordesii Soil litter 4 Liparis barbata Soil litter 5 Habenaria reflexa Soil litter 5 Spathoglotis plicata Soil litter 6 Zeuxine gracilis Soil litter 7 Zeuxine sp Soil litter No Environmental Parameters Measurement Result (Average) 1 Soil moisture (%) 53 2 Humidity (%) 72 3 Temperature (OC) 26 4 pH 5 5 Light Intensity (Lux) 2477 6 Place Altitude (m) 330-777 J. Tropical Biodiversity and Biotechnology, vol. 09 (2024), jtbb89174 -10- of 2,477 lux. The light requirements for orchids vary depending on the type. Some require direct light around 5000 lux, light (3000-5000 lux), medium (2000-3000 lux), and under shade (1000 lux) (Jacquemyn et al. 2007).   Based on the altitude, all types of orchids found on Mount Tilu are found at an altitude of 330-777 meters above sea level. Orchid diversity in Java is found at an altitude of 500-2000 m as much as 90%, in the low-lands 9%, and upland 1% (Yudaputra et al. 2024). Although at the re-search location orchid species were found at an altitude of 300 meters above sea level, these conditions indicate that orchids are not only found at an altitude of 500 meters above sea level. This is in accordance with the statement of Steenis (1975), that orchids can be found at altitudes be-low 500 meters above sea level or more than 2000 masl, and the diversity of orchid species will decrease. If viewed based on the influence of envi-ronmental parameters, it is clear here that these factors greatly influence the diversity of orchids.  Potential Utilisation of Orchids in the Mount Tilu Area In Indonesia, the use of orchids is mostly for ornamental plants. Even internationally, orchids play an important role in the cut flower industry because of their attractiveness, long shelf life, high productivity, proper blooming season, easy packing and transportation. Orchids account for a large part of the global floricultural trade as cut flowers and as pot plants and are estimated to account for around 10% of the international trade in fresh cut flowers (De et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2022).  If we look at the use of orchids as ornamental plants, these plants play a very important role in supporting the community's economy. Un-fortunately, there are still many people who tend not to know the various types of natural orchids so that their use is very limited. As is the case with the local people on Mount Tilu, no one has used orchids either for economic needs, just for decoration, or for health. Communities tend to take advantage of more promising forest products such as wood, rubber latex, medicinal plants, or honey from bees. Public knowledge of natural orchids is also very minimal, this is evidenced by the fact that they do not know if there are terrestrial orchids. They know that orchids are plants that attach to host trees. But there was lack of public knowledge about orchids causes the utilization of orchids in the area is also still lacking.  Although all types of orchids in the Mount Tilu area have the po-tential to be ornamental plants, most of them have small flowers, the col-ours are not as attractive as Acriopsis liliifolia, Cleisostoma discolor, and Polystachya concreta. In fact, orchids must meet several criteria in order to sell well in the market to meet consumer tastes such as flower shape, size, color, resistance, number of flowers per stalk, and fragrance. Based on the results of the study, there are several types of orchids that have beautiful flowers, one of them Vanda tricolor (Figure 8). These orchids are very popular among lovers of ornamental plants, but now their number in na-ture is decreasing. While there are other types that have quite interesting flowers Ascocentrum miniatum popular enough to be commercialized, Coe-logyne speciosa, Coelogyne trinervis, Aerides odorata, Rhyncostilis retusa, and Calanthe triplicata. As for Chilochista javanica (ghost orchid), this orchid is very unique because it has no leaves and the flowers are quite beautiful even though they are small. With the beauty of the flowers from these types of orchids, it has the potential to be developed as a hybrid (hybrid) and cultivated to fulfil the demand for ornamental plants.  In fact, the use of orchids is not only limited as ornamental plants, some are used as herbal medicine. In Indonesia itself, the Batak Ethnic J.

Tropical Biodiversity and Biotechnology, vol. 09 (2024), jtbb89174 -12- community of North Sumatra also uses orchids as medicine. This is evi-denced by the discovery of types of orchids that are traded in the main markets of Karo Regency, namely the Kabanjahe and Berastagi markets such as Annoectochilus reindwardtii (for fever, stamina enhancer, cancer, aphrodisiac), Macodes petola (aphrodisiac fever), The nerves are folded (aphrodisiac stomach ache), Nervilia aragoana (boils, fever, stamina en-hancer), and Dendrobium salacense (stomach ache). The demand for these four orchids is high (except Dendrobium salacense), but its supply is low except Nervilia Aragoana moderate supply. In Kaban Tua Village (in Karo District) and Simbou Baro Village (Simalungan District) there are 5 spe-cies of orchids that are used as medicine, namely Annoectochilus reindward-tii (for fever medicine, stamina enhancer, aphrodisiac), Godyera rubicunda (diabetes mellitus, stamina enhancer), Nervilia Aragoana (fever, stamina enhancer), Nervilia plicata (fever, aphrodisiac), and Phaius callosus (diabetes mellitus). Whereas in Simbou Baro Village (Simalungan Regen-cy) there are 2 species of orchids that are used as medicine namely Den-drobium salacense (abdominal pain) and Macodes petola (cancer, fever). The same thing happened to the people of Toba, North Sumatra, who used orchids as traditional medicine (Silalahi & Nisyawati 2015; Aswandi & Kholibrina 2021). Meanwhile in Sanggau Regency, West Kalimantan, it is known that Plocoglottis lowii it is also used as a medicine to detoxify various poisons in the body including psychotropic poisons (Normagiat et al. 2018).   Based on the explanation above, the potential for exploiting the wealth of orchids in the Mount Tilu area is actually unlimited. Utilisation for ornamental plants also has great potential to improve the communi-ty's economy. Although most types of orchids do not meet the criteria to meet consumer tastes, advances in hybridization technology, domestica-tion and genetic engineering can increase the number and quality of or-chids (Sadili & Sundari 2017). In addition, the potential for orchids on Mount Tilu to be used as medicine needs to be taken into account even though only a few types of orchids have been proven as medicines.  Seeing the potential utilisation of orchids in Mount Tilu, conserva-tion activities should be carried out. Although all orchid species found are not included in the IUCN, CITES, and Indonesian Law No. P. 106 on protected plants and animals. With more than 28,000 species in the world, orchids are the second largest family after the most threatened Asteraceae (Chase et al. 2003; Chase et al. 2015). To date, there are 1098 orchid species listed on the IUCN Red List, and 48.7% of these are cate-gorised as threatened (endangered 456 species, critically endangered 259 species, extinct 6 species, and vulnerable 240 species) by IUCN. So, the threat of orchid orchids does not only occur in Indonesia but also global-ly.   The threat is greatest due to habitat damage and climate change, but many orchids are also threatened due to wild harvesting for horticul-tural, food and medicinal purposes. Therefore, we need to take a possible approach to address threats on a broad scale. According to Fay (2018), orchid conservation efforts can be done by understanding orchid biology such as: 1. Systematics and genetics studies to identify and determine conservation priorities; 2. Conservation of habitat, e.g., host trees and physical conditions of the environment; 3. Understand pollinators and orchid pollination; 4. Understand the association with mycorrhiza, for the growth of orchid seeds. In addition, it can also control illegal harvesting for trade and carry out tissue culture propagation or conventional culti-vation. Documenting and collecting orchids also help in contributing da-tabases to conservation plans. Some of these efforts can be realized well if J. Tropical Biodiversity and Biotechnology, vol. 09 (2024), jtbb89174 -13- elements of society and government support each other to make conser-vation efforts so that the orchid will not become extinct in the future.    CONCLUSION Based on this research, we found 31 species from 28 genera consisting of 24 epiphytic orchids and 7 terrestrial orchids in the Mount Tilu Kuningan area, West Java. Furthermore, regarding the potential use of orchids on Mount Tilu, conservation activities should be carried out, alt-hough all types of orchids found are not included in the red list of IUCN, CITES, and Indonesian Law No. P. 106 concerning protected plants and animals. The use of orchids should be done wisely by carrying out con-servation efforts so that these orchids will not become extinct in the fu-ture.
