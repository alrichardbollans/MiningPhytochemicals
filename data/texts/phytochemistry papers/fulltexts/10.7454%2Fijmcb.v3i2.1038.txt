This cancer is caused by uncontrolled growth of breast cells. Treatments for this ma-lignancy are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy however those methods can cause adverse effects and quite expensive. Complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) are also used to support those main treatments, one of them is herbal medicine. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis is known to have various phytochemical components with antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, and analgesic activities. This study is aimed to determine the phytochemical composition, antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extract towards MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Method: Dried Hi-biscus rosa-sinensis was milled to a powder, subsequently extracted by multilevel maceration method using n-hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol as solvents. Phytochemical components were an-alyzed by phytochemistry test and thin layer chromatography (TLC). Antioxidant activity was de-termined using DPPH method, whereas cytotoxic activity towards MCF-7 breast cancer cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Results: Hibiscus rosa-sinensis were proved to contain triterpenoids in all extracts, alkaloids in n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts, flavonoids and tannins in ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts, and steroids in n-hexane extract. TLC analysis showed n-hexane extract con-tains 8 phytochemical compounds, ethyl acetate contains 6 compounds, and ethanol extract contains 2 phytochemical compounds. Antioxidant activity of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extracts towards DPPH free radicals were highly active with IC50 value of 1.56 µg/mL for ethyl acetate extract and 42.30 µg/mL for ethanol extract. Cytotoxicity of ethyl acetate extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis towards MCF-7 breast cancer cells was moderately active with IC50 value of 79.37 µg/mL. IC50 value of n-hexane and ethanol extracts were 125.23 µg/mL and 210.77 µg/mL, respectively, in which both were categorized in weakly active. Conclusion: Hibiscus rosa-sinensis contains several phytochemical components which showed highly active antioxidant activity towards DPPH free radicals and mod-erate-to-weak cytotoxic activity towards MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Based on data from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, cancer was responsible for roughly 8.2 million fatalities in 2012. The predominant forms of cancer that significantly contribute to death include breast cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer. In 2013, breast cancer had a high incidence in Indonesia, with a prevalence rate of 0.5%, resulting in 61,682 cases [1]. Incidence of breast cancer in Indonesia has increased year by year. According to the Global Cancer Project (GLO-BOCAN) data in 2020, breast cancer accounted for 16.6% of all cancer cases and was the most prevalent kind of cancer among women. The study documented a total of 68,858 newly diagnosed instances of breast cancer and 22,430 fatalities globally as a result of the disease [2]. The global survival rate for this illness exhibits significant variation, with over 80% survival in rich nations and fewer than 40% in underdeveloped countries for a five-year survival rate [3]. These figures establish breast cancer as one of the most feared forms of cancer among women, especially in Indonesia [4]. Breast cancer is the malignant growth of epithelial cells that line the ducts or lobules of the breast. Breast cancer is a neoplasm resulting from the unrestrained proliferation and maturation of breast cells, with the potential to metastasize to adjacent tissues or distant organs, including the bones, liver, lungs, and brain [4,5]. MCF-7 cells are a cell line ob-tained from breast adenocarcinoma. MCF-7 is categorized as a luminal A molecular sub-type owing to its estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive attributes. As a result, MCF-7 cells exhibit estrogen sensitivity, and their proliferation is contingent upon estrogen exposure [6]. Efficient care of breast cancer is crucial in order to avoid the advancement of the ill-ness and death. The treatment strategy is contingent upon the level of severity or stage of the malignancy. Typical treatment options consist of surgical procedures, systemic ther-apy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy [7]. These therapies frequently result in toxic consequences on healthy bodily tissues, such as vasomotor syndrome, nau-sea, vomiting, edema, and arthralgia. Moreover, a significant number of individuals fre-quently develop resistance to anticancer drugs. Hence, it is imperative to explore alternate therapies that might mitigate the adverse effects and drug resistance commonly associ-ated with chemotherapy or radiation. Based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of individuals diagnosed with cancer choose to utilize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as part of their treatment. CAM encompasses many practices such as acupuncture, vitamin supplementation, herbal remedies, and other similar ap-proaches [8]. Herbal medications have demonstrated efficacy in treating breast cancer, such as Echinacea sp., Allium sativum, Curcuma longa, Arctium lappa, and others [9]. Hibiscus, particularly the species of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, generally referred to as the hibiscus flower (Figure 1) [10,11], has considerable promise in the treatment of many ail-ments. This species has been documented to possess antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidia-betic, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antifertility, antifungal, anticancer, antihyper-lipidemic, antidepressant, antipyretic, and several other actions [12]. Prior studies have demonstrated that the Hibiscus extract (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) has anti-cancer properties against HeLa cells, a kind of cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, with IC50 value of 86.86 µg/mL [13]. Further investigation is required to fully explore the potential of Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) in combating cancer. Thus, this research aims to perform a phytochemical investigation to determine the specific secondary metabolite chemicals found in the Hi-biscus extract, as well as its antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. MCF-7 is categorized as a luminal A molecular subtype owing to its estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive attributes. As a result, MCF-7 cells exhibit estrogen sensitivity, and their proliferation is contingent upon estrogen exposure. MCF-7 cells have reduced aggressive-ness, non-invasiveness, and a low likelihood for metastasis [14]. Nonetheless, research on the cytotoxic effects of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flower originated from Indonesia against 2Indonesian Journal of Medical Chemistry and Bioinformatics, Vol. 3 [2024], No. 2, Art. 3https://scholarhub.ui.ac.id/ijmcb/vol3/iss2/3DOI: 10.7454/ijmcb.v3i2.1038 3 of 13  Ind.

Therefore, in this work, cytotoxicity of the Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extract will be evaluated against MCF-7 breast cancer cells.  Figure 1. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis [10,11] 2. Results 2.1 Phytochemical Analysis The extracts used in this research are Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extracts in n-hexane (EHH), ethyl acetate (EHA), and ethanol (EHE) solvents.

TLC Chromatogram of H. rosa-sinensis Extract 2.2 DPPH Antioxidant Activity Test of H. rosa-sinensis extract The results of the antioxidant activity analysis using the DPPH assay (IC50 values) can be seen in Table 3. The DPPH test was not conducted on EHH (n-hexane extract) because it is non-polar and could not fully dissolve in the ethanol solvent used in the DPPH test. The test was performed in triplicate, and the IC50 value for EHA (ethyl acetate extract) was found to be 1.558 µg/mL, while the IC50 value for EHE (ethanol extract) was 42.303 µg/mL. The IC50 value for ascorbic acid, used as a positive control, was found to be 0.690 µg/mL. Table 3.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.7454/ijmcb.v3i2.1038 E-ISSN : 2963-3818 The regression equation between ethyl acetate extract (EHA) and MCF-7 cells may be represented by the equations y = 42.054x - 18.33 (R2 = 0.7973), y = 51.144x - 57.815 (R2 = 0.983), and y = 12.241x + 27.592 (R2 = 0.8306), as shown in Figure 6. Whereas, the linear equations representing the effect of ethanol extract (EHE) on MCF-7 cells were derived as follows: y = 40.184x - 52.105 (R² = 0.978), y = 35.718x - 21.375 (R² = 0.9989), and y = 34.419x - 28.05 (R² = 0.972). These equations are illustrated in Figure 7. 3. Discussion 3.1 Phytochemicals in Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Extracts Phytochemical analyses performed on Hibiscus rosa-sinensis demonstrated the exist-ence of different secondary metabolites in each extract, as indicated in Table 3. The Hibis-cus rosa-sinensis contain triterpenoids in all three extracts (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and eth-anol), alkaloids in non-polar extract of n-hexane and semipolar extract of ethyl acetate, flavonoids and tannins in semipolar extract of ethyl acetate and polar extract of ethanol, and steroids in only non-polar extract of n-hexane. However, no glycosides or saponins were found in any of the extracts. The three extracts include triterpenoids, which are a kind of secondary metabolite often seen in several plant species. Prior in vitro and in vivo research has shown that triterpenoids have immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, proapoptotic, antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, and hepatoprotective properties. Triterpenoids exert their effects via modulating transcription factors, growth factors, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, and tumour angiogenesis [15-17]. The second-ary metabolite alkaloid was detected in two extracts of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, specifically n-hexane and ethyl acetate. Alkaloids possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer, analgesic, local anaesthetic, neuropharmacological, antimitotic, and antifungal properties. Alkaloids frequently employed in medicine include morphine, which serves as an analgesic [18]. Flavonoids and tannins are additional secondary metabolites present in the ethyl ac-etate and ethanol extracts. Flavonoids are extensively utilized in diverse pharmaceuticals owing to their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic properties. Flavonoids function as anti-inflammatory agents by impeding the production of inflammatory medi-ators and hindering the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Flavonoids, acting as antioxi-dants, serve as inhibitors of several enzymes including cyclooxygenase (COX), xanthine oxidase (XO), and lipoxygenase. Flavonoids, which are used as anticancer drugs, control the expression of genes in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, hinder cell growth, and trigger apoptosis [19]. Tannins possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antivi-ral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Empirical inves-tigations have demonstrated that tannins can augment the antioxidant efficacy in the bloodstream of sheep and calves, as well as in the muscles, liver, and plasma of goats [20]. Furthermore, the n-hexane extract has a distinct secondary metabolite, namely ster-oids, which are absent in the other extracts. Steroids possess anti-inflammatory, antibac-terial, anesthetic, and anticancer properties. Phytochemical steroids have the ability to control the activation of genes, trigger programmed cell death, and reduce cholesterol lev-els by as much as 15%. This component is frequently promoted as a dietary supplement and has been utilized for the purpose of preventing cancer [21]. The findings of the TLC experiment are presented in Table 2 and Figure 2. The results suggest that the n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts have multiple compounds with same retention factor values, such as 0.24, 0.34, 0.45, 0.59, and 0.66. However, the ethanol extract does not have any compounds with the same retention factor values as the other extracts. This implies that the n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts have comparable chemical constituents. The selection of mobile phase can also have an impact on this. The n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts utilized hexane and ethyl acetate as the mobile phase, with a ratio of 10:1. On the other hand, the ethanol extract employed chloroform and methanol as the mobile phase, with a ratio of 1:10. The ethanol extract's mobile phase was rendered more polar than its phytochemical components, resulting in the phytochemical 7Arsianti et al.: Phytochemistry, Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Activities of HibiscusPublished by UI Scholars Hub, 2024 8 of 13  Ind. J. Med. Chem. Bio. 2024, 3, 2. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7454/ijmcb.v3i2.1038 E-ISSN : 2963-3818 components migrating farther up the TLC plate. Consequently, the retention factor values were elevated, measuring 0.71 and 0.87 [22]. 3.2 Evaluation of the Antioxidant Properties of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Extract The DPPH test was employed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the extracts by measuring their efficacy in neutralizing DPPH free radicals. The results were presented as IC50 values, indicating the concentration of the extract necessary to block 50% of the DPPH free radicals. The assay was performed on the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts, excluding the n-hexane extract due to its non-polar characteristics, rendering it insoluble in the polar ethanol solvent utilized for the test. The IC50 values of the two extracts were juxtaposed with the IC50 value of ascorbic acid, which acted as a reference standard [23]. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited superior antioxidant activity, with an IC50 of 1.558 µg/mL, compared to the ethanol extract, which had an IC50 of 42.303 µg/mL. Both extracts exhibited dose-dependent activity. In comparison to ascorbic acid (IC50: 0.69 µg/mL), the ethyl acetate extract exhibited a marginal decrease in efficacy, while the ethanol extract shown much lower effectiveness, necessitating a substantially greater concentration to achieve 50% inhibition of free radicals. Marjoni et al. classify both extracts as highly active antioxidants (IC50 < 50 µg/mL), with the ethyl acetate extract exhibiting superior antioxi-dant efficacy compared to the ethanol extract [24]. The antioxidant efficacy of the extracts is determined by their phytochemical content. Table 2 illustrates that both the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts include similar compo-nents, including flavonoids, tannins, and triterpenoids. The ethyl acetate extract includes alkaloids, which are not present in the ethanol extract. Flavonoids, tannins, and triterpe-noids are recognized for their antioxidant characteristics, whilst alkaloids offer anti-in-flammatory and analgesic benefits. The ethyl acetate extract has better antioxidant activity relative to the ethanol extract, possibly attributable to its elevated content of secondary metabolites, enabling it to neutralize 50% of DPPH free radicals at a reduced concentration [25]. 3.3 Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Effects of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Extract on MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells The MTT test was employed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis preparations. Analogous to the DPPH experiment, the outcomes were represented as IC50 values, denoting the dose necessary to inhibit 50% of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The IC50 results were compared to the IC50 of doxorubicin, a typical positive control. The ethyl ac-etate extract exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, with an IC50 of 79.37 µg/mL, succeeded by the n-hexane extract at 125.23 µg/mL, while the ethanol extract shown the least impact, with an IC50 of 210.77 µg/mL. All extracts shown a dose-dependent effect. All three ex-tracts of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis significantly weaker than the positive control of doxorubi-cin, which exhibited an IC50 of 14.69 µg/mL. The cytotoxic activity categorization by Atja-nasuppat et al. indicates that the ethyl acetate extract exhibited moderate cytotoxicity, with an IC50 ranging from 20 to 100 µg/mL [26]. On the other hand, the n-hexane and ethanol extracts were categorized as having less cytotoxicity, with IC50 values between 100 and 1000 µg/mL. The cytotoxic action of these extracts may be affected by their phytochemical content of secondary metabolites. The ethyl acetate extract, which has the greatest diversity of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and triterpenoids, exhibited the most significant cytotoxic action against MCF-7 cells. Alkaloids, flavonoids, and triterpenoids possess cytotoxic characteristics, potentially explaining the high effective-ness of the ethyl acetate extract. The n-hexane extract, which includes alkaloids, triterpe-noids, and steroids, exhibited superior cytotoxicity compared to the ethanol extract, pre-sumably owing to these active components. The ethanol extract, exhibiting the lowest cy-totoxicity, comprises flavonoids, tannins, and triterpenoids; however, only flavonoids and triterpenoids possess cytotoxic properties, resulting in its diminished efficacy.

Vutukuri et al. conducted a study to evaluate the cytotoxicity of plant extracts on MCF-7 cells. The non-polar chloroform extract exhibited an IC50 of 124.10 µg/mL, whereas the aqueous extract had an IC50 of 129.33 µg/mL [28]. Nguyen et al. conducted research examining the apoptotic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent, taxol, on MCF-7 cells. The extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis was observed to cause apoptosis only in MCF-7 cells, leav-ing other cells unaffected. The extract, when coupled with taxol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, enhanced the apoptotic impact, facilitating a decrease in the dose of the chemo-therapeutic drug. This indicates that the use of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extract in breast can-cer chemotherapy may mitigate the usual toxicity linked to the treatment [29]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1 Extraction and Maceration of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Samples The specimens utilized in this work are hibiscus blossoms obtained from Depok city, West Java, Indonesia, that were gathered, purified, and desiccated. Subsequently, the desiccated samples were pulverized into a fine particulate form. The powdered materials (200 g) were extracted by maceration for 24 hours using the non-polar solvent of n-hexane, followed by the semi-polar solvent of ethyl acetate, and finally the polar solvent of ethanol. The maceration procedure was repeated three times, utilizing 500 mL of each solvent. The liquids acquired from the maceration process were condensed using a vacuum-drying technique to create concentrated extracts of hibiscus in hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol. These extracts were then utilized for subsequent investigations. 4.2 Procedure of Phytochemistry Tests 4.2.1 Saponin Test [30] Amount of 1 gram of plant extract was put into a test tube. Then, 10 mL of distilled water was added. The test tube was shaken vertically for a duration of 10 seconds, fol-lowed by a resting period of 10 seconds. If the extract includes saponins, it will produce a consistent foam that is 1-10 cm in height and will remain stable for around 10 minutes. To verify, introduce a single droplet of 2N hydrochloric acid into the test tube. A persistent presence of foam suggests a favorable outcome. 4.2.2 Flavonoid Test [30] One mL of the extract was transferred into a test tube. Amount of 0.5 mL of concen-trated hydrochloric acid was mixed with a four cm piece of magnesium metal. Allow the solution to rest and carefully examine. The presence of red, orange, or green hues indicates a favorable outcome. 4.2.3 Tannin Test [30] One mL of the plant extract was mixed with 1 ml of a solution containing 10% FeCl₃ in a test tube. Any alterations or modifications was carefully observed. The presence of a favourable outcome is shown by the formation of a deep green or deep blue solid that settles out of the solution. 4.2.4 Glycoside Test [30] Into a test tube, 0.1 mL of the extract was added and then evaporated it using hot water. Five mL of anhydrous acetic acid was mixed with 10 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. The presence of blue or green hues indicates a favorable outcome. 4.2.5 Steroid and Triterpenoid Test [30] 9Arsianti et al.: Phytochemistry, Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Activities of HibiscusPublished by UI Scholars Hub, 2024 10 of 13  Ind. J. Med. Chem. Bio. 2024, 3, 2. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7454/ijmcb.v3i2.1038 E-ISSN : 2963-3818 Plant extract (2 mL) was transferred to a porcelain dish and subjected it to evapora-tion. The remaining substance was transferred to a test tube, and combined it with 0.5 mL of chloroform and 0.5 mL of anhydrous acetic acid, then carefully added 2 mL of concen-trated sulfuric acid around the edge of the test tube. If a violet or brown ring is present at the border, it indicates the presence of triterpenoids. On the other hand, a bluish-green ring indicates the presence of steroids.  4.2.6 Alkaloid Test [30] Two mL of the extract was taken and evaporated it in a porcelain dish. Subsequently, 2 mL of a 2N of hydrochloric acid solution was dispended onto the remaining substance, then the resulting mixture was distributed evenly into three separate test tubes. The initial test tube was utilized as a reference sample. Three drops of Dragendorff reagent was placed in the second test tube and 3 drops of Mayer reagent in the third test tube. A posi-tive outcome is shown by the presence of an orange precipitate in the second test tube and a yellow precipitate in the third test tube. 4.2.7 Procedure of Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) Analysis [31] Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) is a method utilized to isolate and analyze the distinct constituents of a mixture. The procedure starts by depositing a minimal amount of the mixture onto a thin stratum of adsorbent material, usually silica gel or alumina, followed by permitting a solvent to ascend through the layer. The initial phase of TLC entails the preparation of plant samples using several solvents. The TLC plate, functioning as the stationary phase, is trimmed, purified, and activated. The mobile phase, or eluent, is formulated by populating an elution chamber. The extract is put to the plate, about 1 cm from the edge. The plate is thereafter positioned in the elution chamber, ensuring that the eluent does not directly contact the sample. Upon the mobile phase ascending to the apex of the plate, the plate is extracted, dried, and the resultant spots are seen under ul-traviolet light at a wavelength of 366 nm. The Rf value is determined by dividing the dis-tance traversed by the sample by the distance traversed by the solvent. 4.2.8 Evaluation of Antioxidant Activity of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis Extract by DPPH Method [32] Prepare solutions using ethyl acetate and ethanol solvents with concentrations of 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 250 µg/mL Transfer 750 µL of each solution into individual test tubes. Dispense 750 µL of DPPH solution, which has a concentration of 10 µg/mL in ethanol, into the test tubes. Perform the same procedure for the blank and positive control, which is composed of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) dissolved in water. Place the test tubes in a dark environment at the ambient temperature and allow them to incubate for a duration of 30 minutes. Utilize a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to quantify the absorbance of the solu-tion at a specific wavelength of 517 nm. Quantify the extent of DPPH inhibition in order to ascertain the IC50 value and evaluate the antioxidant efficacy of the examined extracts. Inhibition of extract (in percentage) against DPPH was calculated using the formula:  Inhibition (%) = ((control absorbance – sample absorbance)/control absorbance) x 100 % The IC50 value was obtained from the linear regression equation of log concentration versus percentage of inhibition, in which, by substituting “y” with 50% (inhibition) to get x value in log concentration, antilog or inverse log of x value gave IC50 value. 4.2.9 Assessment of Cytotoxic Activity of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extract on MCF-7 Cells using the MTT assay [33] MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured, then quantify the number of cells, and di-lute them using culture media. Dispense 100 µL of cell-containing culture media into des-ignated wells on a plate, while reserving 3 wells as empty controls. Examine the arrange-ment of cells with a microscope. Allow the cells to incubate for a period of 24 hours in 10Indonesian Journal of Medical Chemistry and Bioinformatics, Vol. 3 [2024], No. 2, Art. 3https://scholarhub.ui.ac.id/ijmcb/vol3/iss2/3DOI: 10.7454/ijmcb.v3i2.1038 11 of 13  Ind. J. Med. Chem. Bio. 2024, 3, 2. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7454/ijmcb.v3i2.1038 E-ISSN : 2963-3818 order to achieve normalization. Prepare solutions in hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol solvents at 8 different concentrations: 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL. Retrieve the plate containing cultivated cells from the incubator, turn it upside down to eliminate the culture media, and absorb any remaining liquid using tissue paper. Dis-pense 100 µL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) into the wells containing cells, then invert the plate once more to eliminate the buffer. Perform this procedure thrice for all samples at different concentrations. Transfer the plate to a carbon dioxide incubator and leave it there for a duration of 24 hours in order to evaluate the cytotoxic effects. Following the incubation period, introduce 100 µL of MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) into both the test and control wells. Allow the plate to undergo incubation for a duration of 4 hours, followed by microscopic examination to detect the presence of purple formazan crystals. Inject 100 µL of a solution containing 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate(SDS) in 0.1N HCl into each well to halt the reaction. Place aluminium foil over the plate and keep it in a dark location for 24 hours to incubate. Lastly, position the plate in a spectrophotometer set to a wavelength of 630 nm in order to quantify the absorbance of the solution in the wells. Determine the proportion of viable cells and the IC50 value against MCF-7 cells. The IC50 of the extracts were compared to the IC50 of doxorubicin as a positive control. IC50 value was obtained from the linear regression equation of log concentration versus percentage of inhibition by substituting “y” with 50% (inhibition) to get x value in log concentration, antilog or inverse log of x value gave IC50 value. 5. Conclusion Hibiscus rosa-sinensis extracts demonstrated the presence of various phytochemical components which showed antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The ethyl acetate extract of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis has the highest antioxidant activity on DPPH, and moderate cyto-toxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a natural source for developing alternative therapies in breast cancer treatment.
