ABSTRACT: The Caryocaraceae family is constituted of 25 species distributed in two genera 
(Caryocar and Anthodiscus). Plants of this family have been used in several phytochemical 
studies for isolation and characterization of chemical compounds. Some of these studies 
evaluated in vitro and in vivo biological activities of extracts and pure substances isolated 
from plants of this family. Nine species of Anthodiscus genus have been described, while no 
phytochemical study related to them has been reported. On the other hand, Caryocar genus 
presents 16 species with several medicinal uses like for the treatment of colds and bronchitis, in 
the prevention of tumours, as a regulating agent of the menstrual flow, to treat ophthalmological 
problems and for the cure of hematomas and bruises. Some species of this genus were targeted 
by phytochemical studies and presented, in their composition, the following classes of secondary 
metabolites: triterpenes, fatty acids, tannins, carotenoids, triterpenic saponins, phenolic 
coumarins, phenolic glycosides, and others. The fruits of Caryocar species are very nutritive, 
containing in their composition fibers, proteins, carbohydrates and minerals. Seeds have been 
widely used as oil source with nutritional and cosmetic value. The biological evaluation of some 
species was carried out by using relevant biological assays such as: antioxidant, allelopathic 
and antifungal activities against Biomphalaria glabrata and toxicity on Artemia salina. 
Key words: Caryocaraceae, Caryocar, Anthodiscus, phytochemical constituents, biological 
activities, medicinal uses.

INTRODUCTION
Caryocaraceae is a small botanic family, 
widely distributed in Central and South America, 
composed by 25 species, distributed in two genera, 
Caryocar and Anthodiscus. Plants from Caryocar 
genus are very well studied especially because 
they are good sources of oils and wood, this latter 
294

being of good quality due its hardness, resistance 
to humidity and to attacks by  insects (Prance, 
1990). Caryocar genus presents sixteen species 
some of which possess economical potential since 
their fruits are often used as a source of edible oil. 
Among Caryocar species, Caryocar brasiliense is 
far the most studied species, because of the wide 
use of its fruit, called pequi, in central Brazil. C. 
brasiliense fruits are highly nutritious and very used 
in the preparation of juices and liquors; both the fruits 
and the leaves are used for therapeutic purposes, 
e.g. in the treatment of colds, coughs and bronchitis; 
the seeds are used in the manufacture of soaps and 
as aphrodisiac, and the wood, sturdy and durable, is 
employed in construction and shipbuilding (Prance, 
1990; Araujo, 1995). C. brasiliense wood is also used 
in the manufacture of fences, due to its durability and 
resistance to deterioration (Araújo, 1995).
Prance (1990) reported the flowering of 
C. brasiliense occuring between September and 
January. The fruits develop quickly after flowering, 
being often ripe between the months of January and 
March (Barradas, 1972). The fruit of C. brasiliense is 
round, green, drupoid, possess diameter of about 10 
cm, a persistent calyx with one to four pirenes. The 
mesocarp is subdivided into external and internal 
(edible yellow part), involving the endocarp thorny 
(fine and rigid spines, with 2 to 5 mm long) with a white 
almond or seed. The inner mesocarp and endocarp 
thorny seed constitute the pyrenes (Almeida et al., 
1998). The fruit of Caryocar villosum resembles 
C. brasiliense one, being irregularly shaped with 
a round, oblong shape with approximately 7-9 cm 
diameter. C. villosum fruit has external and internal 
(edible part), mesocarp, and a thorny endocarp. 
The seeds are also widely used in cooking for the 
preparation of dishes and occasionally its oil is 
extracted from the internal mesocarp (Marx, 1997) 
for culinary appilcations.
Anthodiscus genus comprises nine species, 
mainly used as source of wood. No chemical 
description of compounds from Anthodiscus genus 
has been found in the literature so far (SciFinder®, 
CAS, August, 2012). Morphological and anatomical 
studies have been reported for this species, like the 
description of buds. In relation to the peduncle and 
to the receptacle, the richomes are unicellular in 
Anthodiscus. The calyx consists of five sepals close to 
each other in a cupuliform calyx. The corolla consists 
of four or five petals that are basally adnate with the 
adjoining androecial ring. The petals are narrow at 
the base and thick at the ends, and the whole corolla 
is circumscissile at the base and fused at the apex to 
form caducous calyptra (Dickison, 1990). The androceu 
is composed of numerous stamens, around 100-280 
(Prance & Silva, 1973). In general the filaments are 
long, upper petals, and varied in length, presenting 
bright yellow color and are short and bent on the button. 
Anatomically, the carpels are modified leaves, forming 
the ovaries of flowers. In the genus Anthodiscus, 
numerous carpels are opened in the central cavity of an 
ovary. Each carpel contains a single ovule attached to 
the placenta (Dickison, 1990). Polinization is mediated 
by insects (Prance & Silva, 1973).

Species belonging to Caryocar and 
Anthodiscus genera are listed in Table 1.
Chemical constituents 
The fruits of Caryocar species are primarily 
a source of vegetal oils. These oils are used in the 
cosmetic industry, for illumination and lubrication 
(Araújo, 1995). Both the pulp of the fruit and the oil 
obtained from the pulp present high concentration 
of lipids. 
Several studies were conducted to evaluate 
the lipid composition of the oils and high incidence of 
unsaturated fatty acids has been found. Pulp of C. 
brasiliense (pequi) fruit presents an intensive aroma, 
being rich in vitamins, lipids and proteins. This part of 
the fruit is generally cooked with rice and chicken and 
also used in the manufacture of sweets and liqueurs. 
The lipid content of pequi fruit was found to be high 
(51.51%). This fruit also contains proteins (25.27%), 
carbohydrates (8.33%), fibers (2.2%), low water 
contents and high amounts of minerals. Contents 
of dietary fiber in the pulp is higher (10.02%) in 
comparison with the almond, showing also lipids 
(33.40%), carbohydrates (11.45%), and proteins 
(3.00%) besides a high water content (41.50%) 
(Lima et al., 2007).
Both pulp and almonds of C. brasiliense 
have high quantities of oil that reaches approximately 
30% of the composition of each of these parts. This 
high amount of oil places C. brasiliense fruit as a 
potential raw material for the production of esters 
and acids to be used in biodiesel production. The 
flour obtained from external mesocarp of pequi 
presents high amount of starch that can be used as 
feedstock in the production of ethanol. The chemical 
characterization of flour from pequi pulp showed the 
following levels: starch 27.70%, proteins 21.38%, 
fibers 19.70%, ashes 3.82%, lipides 3.60%; moisture 
in this part reaches 16.97%. The almond contains 
mainly proteins (64.41%) and moisture (16.50%). 
As minor components, there were detected 9.88% 
of starch, 8.76% of ashes, 6.72 of fibers, and 6.01% 
of lipids (Macedo et al., 2011).
Fatty acids of C. brasiliense pulp (Figure 
1) were quantified by high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography 
coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid 
chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation 
mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) being found 
oleic (1, 48.71%), palmitic (2, 44.28%), linoleic (3, 
4.43%) and stearic (4, 2.58%) acids (Segall et al., 
2006). Lima et al. (2007) reported a prevalence 
of unsaturated fatty acids in the pulp of the fruit 
(61.35%) and in the almond (52.17%). Compound 1 
is the major component present in the pulp, reaching 
a concentration of 55.87%, followed by 2 (35.17%). 
In the almond of pequi there is predominance of 1 
and 2 acids (43.59% and 43.76% respectively) and, 
in minor amounts, compound 3 (5.51%), 4 (2.04%), 
palmitoleic (5, 1.23%) acids are also present. Fatty 
acids from pequi pulp oil were also evaluated by 
gas chromatography (GC). The major fatty acids 
found were acids 1 (54.28%) and 2 (41.78%), while 
minor amounts of 3 (1.36%), 5 (0.67%), linolenic 
(6, 0.51%), stearic (7, 1.28%), and araquidic (8, 
0.12%) acids were also detected (Miranda-Vilela et 
al., 2009a).
In another study, C brasiliense (pequi) 
oil was analyzed by GC to determine fatty acids 
composition. The fatty acids found were 1 (53.9%), 
FIGURE 1. Structures of some fatty acids found in C. brasiliense.
296

2 (40.2%), 7 (2.3%), 5 (1.4 %), 3 (1%), 6 (0.7%), and 
8 (0.2%) (Facioli & Gonçalvez, 1998).
Fatty acids profile in C. brasiliense has been 
widely studied and, despite of some deviations, 
possible caused by seasonal variations, acids 1 
and 2 were consistently detected as the very major 
components of the oil in most studies. The presence 
of high amounts of oleic acid (1), known as an 
essential omega-9 fatty acid, is very interesting. Oleic 
acid participates of the human metabolism, playing 
a key role in the synthesis of hormones, being one 
of the predominant fatty acids recommended in diets 
aiming at prevention of heart diseases (Lorgeril & 
Salen, 2006; Berry et al., 1991). Oleic acid (1) is also 
reported to possess several biological activities like 
prevention of cardiac diseases, lowering of blood 
pressure and cholesterol reduction (Navarro-Tito et 
al., 2010; Pontes-Arruda, 2009; Hanna et al., 2009; 
Stein et al., 2008, Terés et al., 2008). One of these 
studies demonstrated that the hypothensive effect of 
olive oil is caused by high levels of oleic acid present 
in this oil (70 – 80%), indicating that the intake of olive 
oil increases levels of compound 1 in the membrane, 
lowering blood pressure (Terés et al., 2008).
 In C. coriaceum fruit, the fatty acids 1 
(56.34%), 2 (27.63%), 3 (5.20%) and 6 (4.42%) were 
detected by GC analysis (Lima et al., 1981). 
Among the fatty acids detected in the pulp 
of fruit of C. villosum, 1 (33.50%), 2 (9.50%), 4 
(0.59%), 3 (0.52%), and 5 (0.10%) were the major 
components (Marx et al., 1997).
Qualitative and quantitative comparison of 
fatty acids found in C. brasiliense, C. villosum and 
C. coriaceum can be found in Table 2.
While fatty acids have been reported for 
three species of the genus Caryocar, the composition 
of triglycerides has been reported only for C. 
brasiliense in two different studies. In the first one, 
triglycerides contents in C. brasiliense pulp were 
quantified by HPLC, GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS, 
indicating the presence of POO (palmitoyl dioleoyl 
glycerol, 9, 46.6%), POP (dipalmitoyl oleoyl glycerol, 
10, 45.2%), OOO (trioleoyl glycerol, 11, 5.6%) and 
OOS (dioleoyl stearoyl glycerol, 12, 0.52%) (Segall 
et al., 2006). In another study, C. brasiliense oil 
was analyzed by GC to determine triglycerides 
composition indicating the presence of POP (10, 
27.6%), POO (9, 22.9%), POS (palmitoyl oleoyl 
glycerol, 13, 18.2%), SOO (stearoyl dioleoyl, 14, 
9.1%), SOS (distearoyl oleoyl glycerol, 15, 8.7%) 
OOO (11, 5.4%), LOO (linoleoyl dioleoyl glycerol, 
16, 3.8%), POL (palmitoyl oleoyl linoleoyl glicerol, 
17, 2.7%) and PPS (dipalmitoyl stearoyl, 18, 0.3 %) 
(Facioli & Gonçalvez, 1998). Some of the differences 
found can be related to the different procedures 
used in the oils extraction. Facioli and Gonçalvez 
(1998) cooked the fruits in water and evaluated the 
oil obtained while Segal et al. (2006) extracted the 
oil directly from the dried fruits. 
For two species, C. brasiliense and C. 
villosum, phytochemical studies reported the 
presence of carotenoids in fruit pulps, an interesting 
fact since these fruits are edible and carotenoids are 
precursors of vitamin A, possess antioxidant activity, 
and are associated with reduction of cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases risk (Bender, 2005).
Ramos et al. (2001) carried out an evaluation 
of pro-vitamin A capacity of pequi fruit. Carotenoids 
were characterized in order to evaluate losses of 
nutritional factors under conventional cooking of 
pequi pulp with rice. The carotenoids extracted 
from pequi pulp, raw or cooked, were identified as 
ζ-carotene (19), β-carotene (20), β-cryptoxanthin 
(21), cryptoflavin (22), anteraxanthin (23), zeaxanthin 
(24) and mutatoxantin (25). The contents of 
carotenoids found were 231.09 and 154.5 µg/g for 
raw and cooked pulp, respectively.
It was noticed that, from the carotenoids 
found in the raw pulp of C. brasiliense, 23 was present 
in higher concentration (40.54%), followed by 24

(34.24%), 22 (7.70%), 20 (6.35%), β-cryptoxanthin 
(26, 5.25%), 19 (4.05%), and 25 (1.87%). After the 
conventional cooking it was observed a different 
concentration of these carotenoids: 24 (51.75%), 
23 (20.30%), 22 (8.22%), 20 (7.90%), 19 (5.30%), 
21 (5.18%), and 25 (1.35%). The carotenoids 20, 22 
and 26 presented activities as vitamin “A” precursors 
and 20 was found to be the principal responsible for 
pro-vitamin “A” activity in all samples analyzed. It 
was noticed that after conventional cooking, loss of 
carotenoids in pequi pulp occurred on approximately 
30.25%, corresponding to the average loss of 
12.12% in vitamin “A” level (Ramos et al., 2001). 
Structure of the major carotenoids isoladed from C. 
brasiliense are shown in Figure 2.
The carotenoids contents of C. brasiliense 
pulp were also characterized by diodo array detector 
- high performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
mass spectrometry(HPLC-DAD-MS) and ultraviolet-
visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry technique as  24, 
violaxanthin (27), lutein (28), together with small 
quantities of 20, 21 and neoxanthin (29) (Azevedo-
Meleiro et al., 2004).
C. villosum has shown to be a good source 
of the carotenoids 20, and 21, besides presenting small 
quantities of 19, cis-β-cryptoxanthin (30), and α-carotene 
(31) (Godoy, 1993). In other study, C. villosum pulp 
showed presence pro-vitamins in its composition, such 
as trans-α-carotene (32), 13-cis-β-carotene (33), trans-
β-carotene (34), neocryptoxanthin (35) and trans-
β-cryptoxanthin (36) (Godoy & Rodriguez-Amaya, 
1994).
Analysis by GC-MS of C. brasiliense seeds 
oil presented ethyl hexanoate (37) ester as the major 
compound (70.9 – 91.0%) (Passos et al., 2003). 
GC-MS was also used to identify several volatile 
constituents of C. brasiliense fruit pulp. The major 
compound found was 37 (52.9%) followed by minor 
quantities of 3-methylvaleric acid (38, 6.0%), ethyl 
octanoate (39, 4.6%), tetrahydrofurfuralcohol (40, 
4.3%), ethyl butanoate (41, 4.1%), butyl palmitate 
(42, 3.7%) and isobutyl stearate (43, 2.6%) (Maia 
et al., 2008) (Figure 3).
Ethanol extract from the leaves of C. 
brasiliense showed presence of friedelin (44), 
friedelanol (45), and oleanolic acid (46) in its 
composition, as well as β-amyrin (47), β-sitosterol 
(48), stigmasterol (49) and ellagic acid (50) after 
FIGURE 2. Structures of carotenoids found in C. brasiliense fruit pulp.

hydrolysis of the extract (Oliveira et al., 1968). Also 
in the ethanolic extract, quinic (51) and gallic (52) 
acids, quercetin (53) and quercetin 3-O-arabinose 
(54) were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS (Roesler et 
al., 2008). 
Phytochemical study of the epicarp and 
external mesocarp of C. brasiliense fruit (ethanolic 
extract) led to the isolation of several compounds: 
2, 48, 49, 52, ethyl gallate (55), 5-hydroxyfurfural 
(56), methyl shikimate (57), and mixtures of β-D-
fructopyranose (58) and β-D-fructofuranose (59), 
α- (60) and β-D-glucose (61), and lupeol (62) 
(Figure 4). Compound 55 was found to be the major 
constituent, being present as 14% of the crude 
ethanolic extract, but this compound is the reaction 
product of esterification of 52 during extraction, 
which means gallic acid is the major component of 
this extract (Ascari et al., 2010).
C. brasiliense fruit presents 209 mg of total 
phenolics in 100 g of the pulp; this value is higher 
than those found in the majority of pulp of fruits 
consumed in Brazil, such as açaí (136.8 mg/100 g), 
soursop (84.3 mg/100 g) and guava (83.1 mg/100 g). 
The levels of phenolics and carotenoids are reduced 
in pequi kernel in relation to contents found in the 
pulp (Lima et al., 2007). 
A study to assess the composition of C. 
villosum fruit pulp showed the presence of several 
compounds that were quantified in relation to 
the pulp. In this way, there were quantified the 
carbohydrates glucose (63, 0.92%), sucrose (64, 
0.79%), and fructose (65, 0.26%) and the minerals 
Ca (83.0%), Mg (52.0%), P (41.0), Se (0.70%), 
Fe (0.64), Zn (0.52%) and Mn (0.32%). Steroids 
present in C. villosum fruit pulp were 49 (80.20%) 
and 48 (29.70%); free amino acids found were 
aspargine (66, 18.4%), alanine (67, 17.8%), leucine 
(68, 14.62%), valine (69, 11.80%), glutamine (70, 
10.36%), γ-aminobutyric acid (71, 5.84%); biogenic 
minerals amines o-phosphoethanolamine (72, 
3.04%) and taurine (73, 2.52%) were also detected. 
In the same study, the major volatile compounds 
identified were the (e)-nerolidol (74, 19.75%), 
2-heptanone (75, 19.30%), β-bisabolene (76, 18.7%) 
and furfural (77, 14.62%) (Marx et al., 1997). 
In the leaves of C. microcarpum there were 
found large quantities of gallotannin, 50, 52 and 
methyl gallate (78) along with glycosides of 46 and 
its hydroxylated derivatives 2β-hydroxyoleanolic 
acid (79), hederagenin (80) and bayogenin (81) 
(Kawanishi et al., 1986) (Figure 5). 
Studies carried on with fruits, stem barks and 
skin of the species C. villosum and C. glabrum led to 
the isolation, by the first time, of triterpene saponins, 
phenolic glucosides and polar dihydroisocoumarin 
compounds in those species. The isolated saponins 
showed amphiphilic behavior and ability to form 
complexes with steroids, membrane proteins and 
phospholipids. This behavior determined a number 
of biological properties for these substances, such 
as hemolytic activity, cytotoxic and molluscide 
(Schenkel, 2003). 
A combination of silica gel, reversed phase 
column chromatography and semi-preparative 
HPLC of a fraction from the methanolic extract of 
C. villosum stem barks also led to the isolation of 
triterpene saponins, five of them being reported for 
the first time:

identified as the aglicon of saponins 109, 111, 
112, 114 and 115; compound 79 showed to be the 
aglicon present in 116 – 121 (Magid et al., 2006b).

identified as bearing oleanolic acid as aglicon: 
arvenoside B (143), glycoside F (144), glycoside 
D (145), 3-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(13)-β-D-
methylglucopyranosiduronate oleanolic acid 
(146) and glycoside C (147). The other saponins 
isolated in that study were identified and presented 
other types of aglicones, such as colchiside 4 
(148), 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranosylhederagenin 
FIGURE 9. Structure of some triterpene saponins isolated from C. villosum peel fruits.

(149), 3-O-β-D-methylglucopyranosiduronatehede
ragenin (150) e 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosylbayogenin 
(151). The saponins 130, 132, 133, 136, 137 and 
141 showed 2-β-hydroxyoleanolic acid as aglicon 
while, in saponin 122, aglicon showed to be 
gypsogenic acid (Magid et al., 2006c).
From methanolic extract of  C. glabrum 
stem barks, two dihydroisocoumarin glucosides, 
(3S,4S) 3-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxymethyl)-3,4-
dihydro-5,6,7-trihydroxy-4-(4´-hydroxy-3´-methoxy-

isolated by column chromatography in Sephadex 
LH-20 and RP-18 semipreparative HPLC (Magid 
et al., 2007). 
Biological activities
The oil of C. brasiliense fruits was tested 
as an antifungal agent against strains of C. 
albicans but it was inactive (Passos et al., 2003). 
The crude ethanolic extract from barks and 
leaves of C. brasiliense presented toxic activity 
against Biomphalaria glabrata, intermediate host 
of Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of 
schistosomiasis. At the concentration of 100 ppm, 
both ethanolic extracts of barks and leaves showed 
high toxicity against B. glabrata, reaching 90% of 
mortality after 48 hours. At a lower concentration (50 
ppm) a drastic decrease of toxicity was observed, 
leaves presenting 20% of mortality rate; barks extract 
killed 10% of the parasites after 48 hours (Bezerra 
et al., 2002).
The ethanolic extract of C. brasiliense barks 
presented a significant effect on the parasitemia 
caused by Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain, at the 
concentration of 400 ppm, reducing the number of 
circulating parasites in the blood. However, total 
mortality was not achieved (Herzog-Soares et al., 
2002). 
By the other hand, parasitemia of ethanolic 
extract from C. brasiliense barks was evaluated 
on mice inoculated with T. cruzi Y strain, in the 
acute phase of infection. A significant reduction of 
parasitemia was observed at the concentration of 
400 ppm and only eigh days after infection. The 
percentage of growth inhibition corresponded to 
52.9% when compared with the control (Herzog-
Soares et al., 2006).
The effect of methanolic and ethanolic 
extracts, obtained from leaves and floral buds, 
external and internal mesocarps of C. brasiliense 
fruits was tested against phytopathogenic fungi 
species Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum truncatum 
and Fusarium oxysporum. It was observed a stimulus 
in the fungal growth caused by the extracts (Marques 
et al., 2002). 
Hydroalcoholic extract from C. brasiliense 
leaves inhibited the proliferation of promastigota form 
of L. amazonensis, an effect significantly superior 
to the effect shown by glucantime, a drug used for 
leismaniasis treatment. This extract inhibited growth 
of several bacteria tested in the same study. The 
best antibacterial activity was observed against 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.5 x 103 µg/mL) and 
Staphylococcus aureus (2.0 x 103 µg/mL) (Paula-
Junior et al., 2006). 
The antioxidant activity of hydroalcoholic 
extract of C. brasiliense leaves was evaluated by 
DPPH method showing a potent antioxidant activity 
of extract. It was noticed that, at the concentration 
of 1 x 103 µg/mL, the extract showed activity similar 
to that presented by vitamin C and rutin. However, 
no differences between their EC50 values were found 
(Paula-Junior et al., 2006). 
The crude extract and fractions obtained 
from the epicarp and mesocarp of C. brasiliense 
were tested for their antioxidant activity using the 
DPPH method. A high IC50 value was found, which 
may be linked to the presence of gallic acid and 
ethyl gallate (Ascari et al., 2010). Aqueous and 
ethanolic extracts of pulp, seeds and barks from 
C. brasiliense (pequi) and other fruits, known to be 
consumed mainly by the native population of Cerrado 
region in Brazil, were evaluated for their free radicals 
scavenging activity, by using DPPH assay. Aqueous 
FIGURE 10. The new dihydroisocoumarin glucosides from the stem barks of C. glabrum.

305
and ethanolic extracts of pequi peels presented 
IC50 = 9.4 and 17.9 µg/mL, respectively. Gallic acid 
(52), used as a reference compound, presented 
IC50 = 1.4 µg/mL. Determination of total phenols for 
these extracts has been accomplished by the Folin-
Ciocalteau assay. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
the pequi fruit peels presented values of 209.37 and 
208.42 g GAE/kg, respectively in this assay. Both 
extracts showed to be rich in phenolic compounds 
by using the same method having, in consequence, 
high scaveneging activity (Roesler et al., 2007). 
Antioxidant activity of pequi fruit ethanolic extract 
was also assessed using lipid peroxidation in vitro 
model, using rats liver microsomes as an oxidative 
system. The extract showed high antioxidant activity; 
the respective IC50 has not exceeded 0.8 µg/mL 
(Roesler et al., 2008).
Alelophatic activity in the growth of L. sativa 
(lettuce) was evaluated for crude ethanolic extract 
and compounds isolated from the epicarp and 
mesocarp of C. brasiliense. Among the samples 
tested, gallic acid presented greater inhibitory effect 
on root and high stimulatory effect on the stem. The 
same extract and fractions were also evaluated for 
antimicrobial activity on microorganisms S. aureus, 
Salmonella typhymurium, E. coli, Citrobacter freundi, 
Bacillus cereus, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa 
and C. albicans, demonstrating activity for all 
bacteria tested but not against the yeast C. albicans 
(Ascari et al., 2010).
Crude ethanolic extract, ethyl acetate 
fraction and epicuticular wax of leafes (collected 
in March and October), in addition to the oils from 
seed and almonds of C. brasiliense were tested 
for the inhibition of 23 isolates of Cryptococcus 
neoformans, being 19 isolates of C. neoformans 
var. neoformans and 4 of C. neoformans var. 
gattii. Crude ethanolic extract presented antifungal 
activity (89% inhibition) against C. neoformans 
var. neoformans. The epicuticular wax collected in 
October presented greater antifungal activity than 
the wax collected in March and presented growth 
inhibition of 73% of C. neoformans var. neoformans. 
Fixed oils from both, seeds and almonds, as well as 
the ethyl acetate fraction, presented high fungistatic 
activity on C. neoformans. In respect of the two 
varieties of Cryptococcus tested, the analysis of the 
in vitro susceptibility showed that C. neoformans 
var gatii possessed lower sensitivity to extracts of 
C. brasiliense than C. neoformans var. neoformans 
(Passos et al., 2002). 
In another study, the aqueous extract of C. 
brasiliense pulp showed anticlastogenic activity and 
was able to inhibit damage on bleomycin-induced DNA 
in mice. The extract also presented antiproliferative 
activity when tested in vitro in Chinese hamster cells. 
Through this study it was seen that the clastogens 
bleomycin and cyclophosphamide were effective as 
positive controls in DNA damage to be used in the 
CHO-K1 bioassay (Chinese hamster ovary cells). 
The antioxidant property of aqueous extract was 
assessed using the degradation of 2-deoxyribose 
in the Fenton reaction. It was noticed that the 
extract inhibited the Fenton reaction, decreasing the 
formation of hydroxyl radical and reducing oxidative 
degradation of 2-deoxyribose (Khouri et al., 2007). 
 The toxicity of C. brasiliense was evaluated 
to analyze changes in mitotic index of Guaru 
gills (Poecilia vivipara) epithelial cells exposed to 
fractions obtained from leaves and stem barks of 
pequi extracted with ethyl acetate. There were not 
detected significant changes in mitotic index, in 
comparison with control group (Motter et al., 2004).
C. brasiliense extracts were assayed for 
molluscicidal activity against B. glabrata, toxicity 
to Artemia salina, antifungal activity against 
Cladosporium sphaerosperum by autobiography and 
antibacterial activity by agar diffusion test against S. 
aureus, E. coli, B. cereus and P. aeruginosa. The 
leaves extract showed high cytotoxic activity against 
larvae of A. salina and also antibacterial activity 
against microorganisms S. aureus, B. cereus and 
P. aeruginosa (Alves et al., 2000). 
The potential of C. brasiliense fruit oil as 
promoter of in vitro sodium diclofenac penetration 
through human skin was tested. It was noticed that 
the combination of pequi oil and papain showed a 
better performance in formulations than pequi oil 
alone (Lopes et al., 2008). Intersterification of pequi 
oil with stearic acid catalyzed by specific sn 1.3-1.3 
lipase Lipozyme, showed efficient incorporation of 
stearic acid into pequi oil triglycerides (Facioli et 
al., 1998).
The ability of chloroform and aqueous 
extracts of C. brasiliense pulp to protect cells against 
genotoxicity induced by two antineoplasic drugs, 
cyclophosphamide injection (CP) and bleomycin 
(BLM) was evaluated. The pulp fruit extracts did 
not present clastogenic or genotoxic effect in the 
studied cells. Both extracts showed protective 
effects against oxidation damage in DNA caused 
by CP and BLM, indicating ability to inhibit in vivo 
chemical mutagenesis. There was a differentiation 
on the results in relation to the gender of the mice 
tested. The antioxidant activity of extracts was also 
evaluated by measurement of lipid peroxidation 
by TBARS in mice plasmas. Chloroform extracts 
enhanced lipid peroxidation only in male animals 
with no significant effect on females. These 
results suggest that, with appropriate adjustment 
in the dosis, the organic extract can be used as a 
supplement in the diet (Miranda-Vilela et al., 2008). 
The same group has evaluated the protective 
antioxidant effects of pequi oil in runners. This study

was carried with athletes divided in two groups. Both 
groups run the same distance in a race, at the same 
time and under the same environmental conditions 
(before and after taking pequi oil as a supplement). It 
was noted that the pequi oil was effective in reducing 
tissue injuries, based on the values of proteins 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), especially in women. Pequi 
oil also caused reduction of DNA damage in athletes, 
regardless the gender. Protein creatine kinase (CK) 
levels were influenced by the MnSOD genotypes; 
heterozygotes individuals had less damage in 
DNA and smaller tissue injuries and a decrease 
in the levels of lipid peroxidation. These proteins 
presented better response to the pequi oil against 
damage induced by exercise. Therefore, pequi 
oil showed to be a good antioxidant supplement 
besides possessing many other nutritional properties 
(Miranda-Vilela et al., 2009b).
The anti- inf lammatory power of C. 
brasiliense (pequi) oil and its effects on management 
of postprandial lipidemia and on the blood pressure 
of female and male athletes was also evaluated 
by Miranda-Vilela group. Athletes participating 
of this study were evaluated after racing (under 
the same conditions) before and after ingestion 
of capsules containing 400 mg of pequi oil for 14 
days. Pequi oil presented anti-inflammatory effect 
and reduced total cholesterol, HLD and low-density 
lipoprotein in participants aged above 45 years, 
mostly the male ones. There was a decrease in 
blood pressure, suggesting that pequi oil, when used 
as a supplement for athletes, have a hypotensive 
effect (Miranda-Vilela et al., 2009c). The study 
followed to evaluate the effects of pequi oil on 
oxidative exercise-induced damage in plasma and 
erythrocytes. The athletes were subjected to weekly 
training under the same conditions. The assessment 
was made before and after the ingestion of capsules 
containing 400 mg of pequi oil for 14 days. Blood 
samples were analyzed after they raced and were 
subjected to TBARS test and to an erithrogram 
analysis. To verify if the antioxidant effect of pequi 
oil was influenced by antioxidant enzyme genotypes, 
polymorphisms MnSOD (Val9Ala), CAT (21A/T) 
and GPX1 (Pro198Leu) genes were analyzed. 
It was observed that the pequi oil assists in the 
improvement of exercising in athletes because of its 
ability to carry oxygen through the blood. The best 
result in treatment using the pequi oil was presented 
by individuals that have proalell genotypes MnSOD 
Val / Val, CAT AA or AT and GPX1 (Miranda-Vilela 
et al., 2010).  
Dermocosmetic activity of the saponins 
82 and 134, isolated from methanolic extract of C. 
villosum stem barks, was evaluated. Ex vivo lipolitic 
activity was not observed using a human adipose 
tissue explant in the concentration of 100 µg/mL and 
no inhibition of DOPA oxidase activity was observed 
at a concentration of 50 µg/mL. A moderate in vitro 
cytotoxic activity was noticed against keratinocyte 
cells for 134 and for 82 (Magid et al., 2006a).
Methanolic extracts of both, pulp and peels 
of C. villosum fruit, as well as the fraction rich in 
saponins from the peels were evaluated for toxicity 
by brine shrimp (A. salina) assay. All samples tested 
showed good larvicidal activity. Methanolic extract 
from the pulp presented LC50 100 µg/mL being 
more toxic to the methanolic extract of the peels 
(500 µg/mL). The fraction rich in saponins from the 
fruit peels showed a LC50 value of 100 µg/mL, and 
a mortality rate of 17% at 10 µg/mL, being more 
active than the methanolic extracts. The antimicrobial 
activity of saponins 121, 123, 124, 137 and 3-O-β-
D-glucopyranosyl-(12)-β-D-galactopyranosyl 
hederagenin-28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester 
(154) was evaluated  against E. coli, S. aureus, 
P. aeruginosa, Mycobacterium smegmatis and 
Enterococcus faecalis. However, at the used doses, 
none of these compounds were active against these 
micro-organisms (Magid et al., 2006b).
The hemolytic activity of metahanol extracts 
from peels and skin of C. glabrum fruit, as well as 
of ten saponins isolated from the fruit pulp (123, 
124, 126, 133, 134, 135, 136, 138, 145 and 154) 
were evaluated, showing to be less active that the 
reference saponin mixture used in the bioassay. 
The monodesmosidic saponin, 124 and 134 showed 
greater hemolytic activity than bidesmosidic saponins 
126 and 138. The disaccharide saponin 134 was 
more active than the monosaccharide saponin 
154. These results demonstrate that bidesmosidic 
saponins are generally less haemolytic than the 
monodesmosidic ones and that hemolytic activity 
increases with the number of sugar units attached 
in position 3 of the aglicon (Magid et al., 2006c).
Leaves of C. microcarpum presented 
repellent activity/toxicity against cutting leaves ants. 
These leaves are used by the indians of Northwestern 
Amazonia as well as the pulp of C. glabrum, C. 
gracile and C. microcarpum fruits as fish poison. This 
application is related to the presence of saponins in 
this part of the plant (Kawanishi et al., 1986).
CONCLUSION
Caryocaraceae family, distributed in 
Central and South America, presents two genera, 
Anthodiscus and Caryocar. Plants from Anthodiscus 
genus have not been targeted by phytochemical 
studies so far, and its use has been restricted as a 
wooden source. By the other hand, there are several 
reports on the phytochemical constituents and 
biological studies of species from Caryocar genus.

The fruits of many Caryocar species are used to 
produce oil and in the culinary, in the elaboration of 
several foods due to their high contents of vitamins, 
lipids and proteins. The oil, also very used in the 
cosmetic and food industries, possesses high 
amounts of unsaturated fatty acids like palmitic and 
oleic acids. Amongst the species of Caryocar genus, 
oils from the fruit pulp of C. brasiliense, C. villosum 
and C. glabrum were chemically and biologically 
studied, as well as the almond of C. brasiliense. 
Levels of carotenoids in the C. brasiliense and 
C. villosum fruit pulp were determined. In C. 
brasiliense, the major found was anteraxantin and, 
in C. villosum, b-cryptoxanthin and b-carotene were 
the predominat ones. The composition of volatile 
compounds present in fruits pulp and in the seeds 
of C. brasiliense and C. villosum was studied and C. 
brasiliense presented ethyl hexanoate as the major 
constituent in the pulp and in the seed. C. brasiliense 
presents several phenol compounds confirming the 
antioxidant activity reported for its fruit. C. glabrum 
and C. villosum are rich in saponins. Caryocar 
species demonstrated great biological potential. C. 
brasiliense was active against B. glabrata, T. cruzi, L. 
amazonensis and inhibited the growth of the bacteria 
S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Several pre-clinical 
and toxicological studies confirm the antioxidant 
activity of C. brasiliense. C. brasiliense did not 
present clastogenic or genotoxic effects in mice cells 
but instead, protected them against DNA damages 
induced by bleomycin or ciclosphosfamide. The oil 
of C. brasiliense also has cardiovascular protective 
effect, and can be used as a dietary supplement. In 
this way, this review brings about the great potential 
of plants from Caryocar genus.
