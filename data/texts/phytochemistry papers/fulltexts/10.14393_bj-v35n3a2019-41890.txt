ABSTRACT: The revival of non-conventional edible plants enables important gains in nutritional, 
social, cultural, economic, and environmental points of view. Among them, sorrel — Rumex acetosa L. — has 
been deemed pleasant by consumers due to its acid taste. As we do not have a lot of phytotechnical and 
nutritional information about this plant, the objective was to assess the influence of different spacing sets and 
cattle manure dosages on their physical-chemical characteristics and bioactive compounds content with 
antioxidant action. Randomized blocks with four repetitions was chosen as experimental design, using a 
scheme of subdivided plots, with five dosages of weather-beaten cattle manure in the plots and two sets of 
spacing in the subplots. Data was submitted to a variance analysis with two factors (two-way ANOVA). It was 
not verified any significant effect (P>0.05) in the interaction Dosage x Spacing. Fertilization dosages and 
spacing sets did not have any effect on color and total soluble solids average contents, humidity, titratable 
acidity, and phenolic compounds. Increasing dosages of organic fertilizer, up to 75 kg ha-1, reduced the plant’s 
pH; above that amount, pH rose. Presence of anthocyanins and vitamin C was not detected. The total 
carotenoids average content was not influenced by the manure factor, and the plant presented greater total 
carotenoids content in the smallest spacing. Antioxidant activity [1.0 mg mL-1], although inferior to the 
standards that were used (BHT, vitamin C and quercetin), was quite representative. A conclusion was reached 
that fertilizing with weather-beaten cattle manure had an effect only on pH, and cropping spacing had an 
influence only on carotenoids content. Other phytochemicals and physical-chemical characteristics were not 
influenced in sorrel plants with different levels of fertilization and sets of spacing.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Preservation of local species and varieties, 
as well as knowledge about neglected edible plants, 
in addition to contributing to maintain resilience of 
small-scale agricultural systems, they also help to 
stabilize production, minimize risks, as well as 
profit from available micro-environments with 
varieties of more suitable crops (PILLA; 
AMOROSO, 2009). There are several vegetable 
species that are not used or are underused with high 
nutritional qualities that often are greater than those 
of plants usually cropped (LADIO, 2005). Non-
conventional vegetables such as purslane (Portulaca 
oleracea), Malabar speech (Basella rubra), green 
amaranth (Amaranthus viridis), lamb’s ear (Stachis 
lanata), and sorrel (Rumex acetosa) present 
considerable contents of minerals and natural 
antioxidants such as carotenoids and phenolic 
compounds in their constitution, and its regular 
consumption is associated with benefits for human 
health (VIANA et. al, 2015).  
Sorrel (Rumex acetosa L.), having 
characteristic rusticity and flavor, has been found 
pleasant by consumers, presents good marketing 
potential and can contribute to enrich human diet,

because it presents relevant amounts of macro and 
micronutrients in its constitution (SILVA et al., 
2013), besides natural antioxidant compounds such 
as phenolic and carotenoid compounds (VIANA et 
al., 2015). Sorrel belongs to the Poligonaceae family 
and is herbaceous, perennial, about 20 cm (8 in) 
high, forming clumps with several propagules. It is 
usually found in the wilds in regions with mild 
climate in Europe and Asia; in Brazil, it is cropped 
from the State of Rio Grande do Sul to the State of 
Minas Gerais. However, it rarely blossoms in 
Brazilian climate conditions (PEDROSA et al. 
2012; SILVEIRA et al., 2013; MADEIRA et al., 
2013).  
In recent years, a greater conscience about 
the influence of food in health and its direct reflexes 
in quality of life has been generating an increase on 
the demand for healthier food. It is also possible to 
see that farmers are adopting a more conscious 
attitude about their products’ nutrient content 
(RODRIGUES-AMAYA et al., 2008). However, 
according to Miliauskas et al. (2004), there is few 
scientific information about the nutritional 
composition and the bioactive substances with 
health-promoting proprieties content, especially 
regarding plants less used in medicine and culinary. 
Food’s healing and preventive power have 
been emphatically associated with the presence of 
antioxidants, and sometimes correlated to bioactive 
substances concentrations, even if the antioxidant 
effect in a piece of food is clearly differentiated 
from its effect in health (RODRIGUEZ-AMAYA et 
al., 2008). According to Bernardes et al. (2011), the 
ingestion of food containing bioactive compounds 
such as carotenoids, phenolic compounds and 
vitamins constitutes the main form for the organism 
to obtain antioxidants. 
Therefore, the determination of bioactive 
compounds in vegetables is essential to assess the 
source food of those compounds, add scientific 
knowledge about food nutritional composition and 
the benefits in preventing diseases and reinforcing 
the importance of daily consuming these products 
(FALLER; FIALHO, 2009). 
However, it is worth highlighting that 
environmental conditions, fertilization, genetic 
factors, plant variety, among others, widely 
influence phytochemical content in vegetables 
(RAMOS et al. 2011). In addition, studies that 
correlate cropping practices with phytochemicals 
production are rare (ARBOS et al., 2010).  
The development of non-conventional 
vegetables organic cropping technologies can 
increase the diversity of quality food products, 
contribute to population’s food and nutritional 
safety, provide technical assistance to the producer, 
favor environmental conservation, encourage 
production and consumption of those plants.  
Thus, this present study aimed to assess 
physical-chemical characteristics and bioactive 
compounds content in sorrel cropped in different 
sets of spacing and with different dosages of 
fertilization with weather-beaten cattle manure. 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
The experiment was carried out in 
EPAMIG’s Fazenda Experimental Santa Rita, in the 
City of Prudente de Morais, State of Minas Gerais 
(19°27'15"S and 44°09'11"W and altitude of 732 m 
[0.45 miles]). The region is classified as Aw 
according to Köppen (Tropical Wet and Dry or 
Savanna), with a dry season from May to October 
and a wet one from November to April. Soil was 
classified as Red-Yellow Latosol, is clayey in 
texture and presented the following characteristics 
in the layer from 0 a 20 cm (0 to 8 in) deep: pH 
(water) = 6.5; Ca2+ = 5.0; Mg2+ = 0.8; Na = 0.1; Al3+ 
= 0.0; H+Al = 2.0, SB = 6.5; t = 6.5; T = 8.5 
expressed in cmolcdm
-³, V = 76; m = 0 expressed in 
%; P = 8.1 mg dm-³ (Mehlich 1); K = 225 mg dm-³, 
organic matter = 2.7 dag kg-1; B= 0.4; Cu = 1.0; Fe 
= 18.9; Mn = 31.6; Zn = 2.5 expressed in mg.dm-3; 
Prem = 15.5 mg.L-1 and CE = 0.3 dS m-1. 
Weather-beaten cattle samples, dried in a 
greenhouse at 75º C (167º F), presented the 
following chemical characteristics: pH (water) = 
6.9; N = 1.72; P = 0.84; K = 1.44; Ca = 2.03; Mg = 
0.52; S = 0.69, organic carbon = 10.61 and Na = 
0.036 expressed in %; Fe = 29,514; Cu = 43; Zn = 
204; B = 8.2 and Mn = 517, expressed in ppm; C/N 
= 6.16; air humidity contents = 12.22 %, in a 
greenhouse at 75º C (167° F) = 21.52 % and density 
= 0.719 g cm-3.  
This study assessed sorrel (Rumex acetosa 
L.) type I, according to Silva et al. (2013), whose 
exsiccated sample is deposited in EPAMIG’s 
herbarium with the following registration: PAMG 
57029. Matrixes that were cropped in the non-
conventional vegetables center in EPAMIG’s 
Fazenda Experimental Santa Rita in the City of 
Prudente de Morais were used to produce seedlings. 
Plastic bags measuring approximately 20 cm x 10 
cm (8 in x 4 in) were used, with a substrate 
composed by the mixture of ravine soil and weather-
beaten cattle manure in a 1:1 proportion and placed 
in a vegetation housing. 
Randomized blocks with four repetitions 
was chosen as experimental design, with a scheme 
of subdivided plots. The plots consisted of five

levels of weather-beaten cattle manure fertilization 
factor translated into dosages of weather-beaten 
cattle manure (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 t ha-1), and 
subplots were two levels of spacing factor (2 cm x 
25 cm and 30 cm x 30 cm/0.8 in x 9.4 in and 11.8 in 
x 11.8 in).  
In the plots, which consisted of seedbeds of 
1.20 m x 4.00 m (3.9 ft x 13.1 ft) and 0.20 m (0.6 ft) 
high, weather-beaten cattle manure dosages were 
distributed, being 2/3 of the dosage applied five 
days before transplantation and 1/3 of it applied in 
coverage, 20 days after planting the seedlings. In the 
subplots, with an area of 2.4 m2 (25.8 ft²), 24 
seedlings were planted, distributed in four lines of 
six plants, in the respective sets of spacing. The 
eight central plants were considered for the 
composition of the useful plot.  
Periodical hoeing was used as a farming 
practice, and it was not necessary to perform plague 
and disease control. Sprinkling irrigation was 
performed using a SANTENO I – 09 / 1 Kgf cm-2 
hose. Plants were cut at 3 cm (1.1 in) from soil 
level, on the 57th day after transplanting, when they 
reached a point of harvesting. 
Leaves were harvested by chance and 
transported under refrigeration to Federal University 
of São João del-Rei’s (UFSJ) Sete Lagoas Campus, 
where analysis was carried out. 
After verifying the assumptions of 
normality and homogeneity through Shapiro-Wilk 
and Levene tests, dada collected was submitted to a 
variance analysis with two factors (two-way 
ANOVA), according to the statistical model for 
randomized blocks with a scheme of subdivided 
plots.   
Facing the statistical significance of the 
fertilization factor, a regression study was 
performed on tendency analysis between dosages of 
organic fertilizer. For the spacing factor, the amount 
of statistic F was considered; and to compare 
treatment averages against control groups, Tukey 
test was used. In every analysis, a nominal level of 
5% of significance was adopted. The statistical 
analysis was carried out using R Software (R CORE 
TEAM, 2014). 
These were assessed during the experiment: 
physical-chemical characteristics, bioactive 
compounds and antioxidant activity, which will be 
described as it follows. 
 
Physical-chemical assessment  
The instrumental color was measured in 
three different points of full leaves’ abaxial surfaces, 
with the aid of a Konica Minolta colorimeter, model 
CR 410with D65/10 illumination pattern, to read 
parameters L*, a*, and b*. 
Total soluble solids content was determined 
through a direct reading from the filtered portion, 
obtained from grounded leaves, placed on digital 
Reichert model R2mini refractometer prism, with 
automatic temperature compensation (AOAC, 
2012). Results were expressed in °Brix.  
Humidity was obtained from the difference 
between initial and final mass of the sample dried in 
a sterilization greenhouse and drying process at 105º 
C (221º F) until constant weight (AOAC, 2012).  
pH was determined by potentiometry 
(AOAC, 2012), with the aid of a digital pH meter, 
through direct immersion of the electrode in the 
homogenized in natura samples that were added 5 
mL (0.18 oz) of deionized water. 
Titratable acidity was determined by 
titulometry using NaOH 0.01 N as solution and 
phenolphthalein as indicator, according to the 
methodology described in AOAC (2012). Results 
were expressed in percentage of citric acid. 
 
Assessment of bioactive compounds 
Total carotenoids were extracted with 
acetone p.a. and quantified by spectophotometry at 
450 nm (RODRIGUEZ-AMAYA, 1999). Results 
were expressed in µg of carotenoids by 100 grams 
(0.22 lb) of fresh mass. 
Total phenolic compounds content in 
methanolic extracts of the plants was determined by 
Folin-Denis method, according to AOAC (2012). 
Results were expressed in mg of gallic acid 
equivalents (GAE) by 100 grams (0.22 lb) of dry 
mass.  
Anthocyanins were assessed through 
differential pH method, as described by Giusti & 
Wrolstad, (2001). Absorbance was calculated from 
the 
equation
, where Aλ510 = absorbance in wavelength of 510 
nm, Aλ700 = absorbance in wavelength of 700 nm, 
(Aλ510 – Aλ700) pH 1 = difference of absorbance 
amounts read in the solution pH 1.0 and (Aλ510 – 
Aλ700) pH 4.5 = difference of absorbance amounts 
read in the solution pH 4.5. 
Concentration of monomeric pigments in 
the extract was represented in cyanidin-3-glycoside 
and calculated using the equation MA= 
(AxMWxDFx102) / (ε x L), where MA = 
Monomeric anthocyanin (mg 100 g-1), A = 
absorbance difference calculated by previous 
equation, MW = molecular weight of cyanidin-3-
glycoside (= 449.2), DF = dilution factor, ε = molar

absorptivity = 269,000, L = optical path = 1 cm 
(0.03 ft). 
Ascorbic acid content was assessed by high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), in a 
SHIMADZU chromatographer equipped with UV-
VIS detector, involving the following conditions: C 
18 column (ID 4.6 mm x 150 mm/0.02 ft x 0.49 ft), 
loop of 20 microliters, wavelength of 254 nm, flow 
of 1mL min-1. The mobile phase was prepared from 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (5mmol L-1) and 
monobasic potassium phosphate (50 mmol L-1) 1:1, 
according to the technique described by Benlloch et 
al. (1993).  
 
Assessment of antioxidant activity  
Methanolic extract’s antioxidant activity 
was determined by the DPPH method, using as 
positive control BHT, vitamin C and quercetin. This 
technique consists of adding 1 mL (0.04 oz) of the 
extract in concentrations which vary from 0.1–1,000 
µg mL-1 to 1 mL (0.04 oz) of a DPPH methanolic 
solution (0.1 mM). This reaction was processed 
within 1 hour at room temperature. DPPH 
absorption was immediately verifiedat 515 nm in a 
FEMTO® 700S spectophotometer. All of the 
experiments were carried out in triplicate. The 
capacity to kidnap free radicals was expressed as 
radical oxidation percentage of inhibition and 
calculated by the equation %Inhibition=100x 
[(ADPPH –Aextr)/ADPPH], where ADPPH is the 
absorbance of DPPH solution and AExtr is the 
absorbance of the sample in solution (ROESLER, et 
al., 2007). The results were expressed in % and 
compared to reference patterns. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The variance analysis did not reveal any 
significant effect (p>0.05) in the interaction 
Fertilization x Spacing, which indicates that these 
factors act independently on every assessed 
characteristic. Thus, the effects of the main 
(Fertilization) and secondary (Spacing) factors were 
separately studied.  
The dosages of fertilization and sets of 
spacing that were used did not have any effect on 
sorrel’s coloration, whose averages of the amounts 
were equivalent to: L* = 48.50, a* = -16.91 and b* 
= 28.43 (Table 1). It was verified that the amounts 
obtained were very close to those found by other 
authors for sorrel type I, such as those observed by 
Silva et al. (2013): L* = 47.12; a*= -17.67 and b*= 
30.95, even though plants were cropped in different 
time, place and system. Viana et al. (2014) obtained 
the amounts L* = 43.13, a*= -16.45, b*= 25.95 
immediately after harvest in a refrigerate storage 
study.

The average content of total soluble solids, 
humidity and titratable acidity did not present 
significant differences (p>0.05), according to what 
was presented in Table 1, which indicates that 
fertilization and spacing factors, in the assessed 
conditions, did not interfere on those characteristics 
of the plant. Sorrel leaves’ acidity, which is an 
important characteristic of this non-conventional 
vegetable, in this study presented an average of 1.22 
g (0.04 ounce) of citric acid/100 g of fresh matter 
(Table 1), an amount greatly lot superior to that 
reported by Silva et al. (2013) for sorrel from 
EPAMIG-Prudente de Morais-MG’s non-
conventional vegetables center (0.11 g of citric 
acid/100 g of fresh matter) and by Viana et al. 
(2014) for sorrel from Sete Lagoas (0.81 g of citric 
acid/100 g of fresh matter). Acidity in vegetables is 
attributed especially to organic acids that are found 
dissolved in cells vacuoles and it is a quality 
attribute that is related to aroma and taste of food 
(CHITARRA; CHITARRA, 2005).  
It was verified a significant effect (P = 0.05) 
in the fertilization factor for the variable pH, 
indicating that this sorrel characteristic responds to 
the application of different fertilization dosages. An 
average amount of 3.11 for pH was observed, but a 
decrease on the pH of the plant was verified with the 
input of weather-beaten cattle manure up to the 
779 
Profile of phytochemistry  TORRES, M. P. et al. 
Biosci. J., Uberlândia, v. 35, n. 3, p. 775-783, May/June 2019 
dosage of 75 kg ha-1 when compared to the witness. 
Above that dosage, there was an increase on the pH 
amount (Figure 1).  
 
 
Figure 1. Regression model adjusted for pH of the plant, according to the application of weather-beaten cattle 
manure dosages (t ha-1).  
 
The increasing application of weather-
beaten cattle manure probably had an influence on 
the quantity and quality of the nutrients absorbed by 
the plant, which interfered in its pH. The tendency 
of the pH of the plant to increase in dosages above 
75 t ha-1 may be related to soil reactions, considering 
that, in the soil, the increase or reduction of pH, due 
to application of organic matter, depends on the 
predominance of the processes that consume or 
release H+ (SILVA; MENDONÇA, 2007). That 
interferes in the availability of the nutrients to 
plants, such as those of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn cations, 
which are converted into insoluble forms with the 
elevation of the pH of the soil (RESENDE, 2009). 
PH amounts observed in this study are in 
accordance with those detected in sorrel leaves in 
other studies — 2.98 and 3.22 (SILVA et al., 2013 
and VIANA et al., 2014), respectively.  
The factors of fertilization and spacing did 
not present any significant effect (p>0.05) on 
phenolic compounds. The average content of total 
phenols found was equivalent to 840.03 or 870.03 
mg. GAE 100 g-1 dry mass (Table 1), an amount 
inferior to that related by Vieira et al. (2010) to 
Barbados gooseberry (1,693.33 mg GAE 100g-1 dry 
mass), a species that also integrates the list of non-
conventional vegetables, and to contents quantified 
by Asolini et al. (2006) in yerba mate (14,500 mg 
GAE g-1 dry leaf), rosemary (8,000 mg GAE 100 g-1 
dry leaf) and broadleaf plantain (6,500 mg GAE 100 
g-1 dry leaf), species considered sources of phenolic 
compounds. It is worth highlighting that those 
authors used Folin-Ciocalteau spectophotometric 
method.  The average content of total phenols found 
in sorrel becomes a lot more expressive when 
compared to the amounts that Arbos et al. (2010), 
who also used Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, obtained in 
vegetables, such as organic arugula (126.84 mg 
GAE.100 g-1), organic lettuce (108.72 mg GAE.100 
g-1) and organic common chicory (92.15 mg 
GAE.100 g-1).  
The presence of anthocyanins and vitamin C 
was not detected in sorrel leaves assessed in this 
present study. Viana et al. (2015) also reported the 
absence of vitamin C in sorrel type I cropped in the 
Non-Conventional Vegetables Center (EPAMIG-
Prudente de Morais-MG). However, they reported 
the presence of the same in leaves of sorrel type II at 
the concentration of 72.45 mg of vitamin C/g of leaf 
in dry basis. Ascorbic acid or vitamin C is present in 
several fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli, 
cauliflower, spinach, pepper, bell pepper, cabbage, 
among others; and many pre- and post-harvest 
factors — cultivar used, climate conditions, planting 
practices, etc.—have an influence on its 
concentration (CARVALHO et al., 2006).  
The average content of total carotenoids was 
equivalent to 5,200 µg 100 g-1 fresh mass (Table 1), 
an amount inferior to those found by Vieira et al. 
(2015) for sorrel type I (9,464.00 µg 100 g-1 fresh 
mass) and for sorrel type II (8,385.00 µg 100 g-1 
fresh mass). These amounts are comparable to those 
detected on other non-conventional vegetables such 
as sow thistle (5,440 µg 100g-1), Barbados 
780

gooseberry (4,830 µg 100g-1) and arrow leaf 
elephant year (3,170 µg 100g-1), which stand out as 
promising sources of lutein, and on conventional 
vegetables like cauliflower (7,890 µg 100g-1), 
arugula (7,180 µg 100g-1), mustard plant (4,300 µg 
100g-1), chard (4,150 µg 100g-1), and spinach (3,530 
µg 100g-1), considering fresh mass (NACHTIGALL 
et al., 2007). 
Green vegetables have a defined qualitative 
profile, having lutein, β-carotene, violaxanthin and 
neoxanthin as main carotenoids (RODRIGUEZ-
AMAYA et al., 2008). These authors consider to be 
sources rich in carotenoid food that contains 
important-for-health carotenoids greater than 2,000 
µg 100g-1. In a previous study, despite carotenoid 
content being expressive, it was detected the 
presence of 781.00 µg of β-carotene. 100g-1 fresh 
matter (VIANA et al., 2015). 
A significant difference was revealed about 
total carotenoids content (P = 0.0057) according to 
the spacing factor, presenting greater average 
content (5,294.23 µg of carotenoids. 100 g-1 fresh 
mass) in the smallest spacing (25 cm/9.8 in).  
Regarding the capacity to kidnap DPPH free 
radical from sorrel methanolic extracts, it was 
verified that antioxidant action was detected only 
when assessed on the greatest concentration (1.0 
mg.mL-1); this was not observed on the smallest 
concentrations (0.1 mg.mL-1 and 0.01 mg.mL-1), and 
there was a significant difference (P<0.05) in 
relation to fertilization dosages (P<0.0001). 
The average amount of antioxidant activity 
in the dosages of 25 and 50 t ha-1 of weather-beaten 
cattle manure was equal to 73.0% (Table 2), and it 
was the one closest to the average amounts 
presented by BHT (butylhydroxytoluene) patterns, 
vitamin C and quercetin equal to 83.85, 91.72 and 
86.61%, respectively.

There was a significant variation between 
the amounts of antioxidant activity in relation to the 
fertilization dosages and reference patterns that were 
assessed. There was not a significant difference 
between the dosages of 25 and 50, and they showed 
an antioxidant capacity superior to that of the 
control group (without application of weather-
beaten cattle manure) and to those of the plants that 
received dosages of 100 and 75 (t ha-1) of weather-
beaten cattle manure.  
Similar results were described by Arbos and 
assistants (2010), who detected an antioxidant 
capacity of 72.3, 77.2 and 77.3% at a 1.0 mg mL-1 
concentration for organic-produced lettuce, common 
chicory and arugula, respectively. These amounts 
were superior to those obtained in conventional 
cropping — 62.7, 66.6 and 70.1% for lettuce, 
common chicory and arugula, respectively. 
Therefore, results of organic lettuce produced with 
cattle-manure-based bio-fertilizers were the closest 
ones to sorrel samples when cropped with 25 and 50 
t ha-1 of weather-beaten cattle manure. 
Antioxidants have several modes of action, 
and the different methods used to determine these 
activities are performed under different conditions 
(RODRIGUES-AMAYA et al., 2008). There was no 
correlation between carotenoids (correlation 
coefficient: -0.0737; P=0.604) nor between phenolic 
compounds (correlation coefficient: 0.1661; 
P=0.3056) and sorrel’s antioxidant capacity. The 
correlation between total phenolic compounds 
content and antioxidant capacity is still very 
controversial, given that it is possible to stablish a 
good correlation between those two variables in 
several fruits and vegetables, but in some cases that 
correlation is low (VIZZOTTO et al., 2012). These 
authors attribute it to the presence of several other 
phytochemicals, such as carotenoids or vitamins (C 
and E) that may influence on the antioxidant 
activity. Thus, the detected antioxidant activity can

be attributed to other compounds that were not 
assessed. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The fertilization with weather-beaten cattle 
manure and cropping spacing have an influence on 
carotenoids content, antioxidant activity and pH. 
The other sorrel phytochemicals and 
physical-chemical characteristics were not altered 
by fertilization variations with weather-beaten cattle 
manure and spacing, which allows us to consider 
that growing sorrel is viable when smaller spacing is 
used, with the application of small dosages of 
manure.

RESUMO: O resgate das plantas comestíveis não convencionais possibilita ganhos importantes do 
ponto de vista nutricional, social, cultural, econômico e ambiental. Dentre estas, a azedinha, Rumex acetosa L. 
tem agradado o consumidor por seu sabor ácido. Como são poucas as informações fitotécnicas e nutricionais 
sobre esta planta objetivou-se avaliar a influência de diferentes espaçamentos e doses de esterco bovino em 
suas características físico-químicas e no teor de compostos bioativos com função antioxidante. O delineamento 
experimental foi em blocos casualizados com quatro repetições, no esquema de parcelas subdivididas, sendo 
cinco doses de esterco curtido de gado nas parcelas e dois espaçamentos nas subparcelas. Os dados foram 
submetidos à análise de variância com dois fatores (two-way ANOVA). Não foi constatado efeito significativo 
(P>0,05) da interação Dose x Espaçamento. As doses de adubação e espaçamentos não afetaram a cor e os 
teores médios de sólidos solúveis totais, umidade, acidez titulável e compostos fenólicos. Doses crescentes de 
adubo orgânico, até 75 kg ha-1, reduziram o pH da planta, acima deste valor o pH elevou-se. Não foi detectada a 
presença de antocianinas e vitamina C. O teor médio de carotenoides totais não foi influenciado pelo fator 
esterco e no menor espaçamento a planta apresentou maior teor de carotenoides totais. A atividade antioxidante 
[1,0 mg mL-1], apesar de inferior aos padrões utilizados (BHT, vitamina C e quercetina), foi bastante 
representativa. Concluiu-se que a adubação com esterco de gado curtido afetou apenas o pH e que o 
espaçamento de cultivo exerceu influência apenas teor de carotenoides. Os demais fitoquímicos e 
características físico-químicas não foram influenciadas em plantas de azedinha com diferentes níveis de 
adubação e de espaçamento.
