It has six main species which areused as herbal remedies, such as Hyssopus officinalis which is used as a condiment and flavoring agent in food industry. Theother five species are H. ambiguus, H. cuspidatus, H. latilabiatus, H. macranthus, and H. seravschanicus. Its species are used inthe treatment of various ailments such as cold, cough, loss of appetite, fungal infection, and spasmodic condition. Itsconstituents especially essential oils are popularly used as an additive in beverages, foods, and cosmetics. The volatileconstituents are used for aroma in the food industry, cosmetic industry, and household products. The important activeconstituents in its essential oils are β-pinene, pinocamphone, isopinocamphone, and other terpenoids. Hyssopus genus is alsobundled with other secondary metabolites including flavonoids luteolin, quercetin, apigenin, and their glucosides, as well asphenolic compounds including ferulic, p-hydroxy-benzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic, and caffeic acid. Combinedly,the extracts of Hyssopus are reported to have potential antiviral and antifungal activities proven using in vitro studies, whereasin vivo investigations have reported the crucial role of Hyssopus extracts in plasma membrane relaxation, cytotoxic, andsedative effects. This plant is believed to be relatively safe at levels commonly used in foods; nevertheless, more studies areneeded to determine the safety profile.1. IntroductionHyssopus (Lamiaceae) is a genus of herbaceous or semi-woody plants that includes about 10 to 15 species, distrib-uted mainly in the East Mediterranean to central Asia andMongolia [1, 2]. The name Hyssopus is derived from Hebrewezob which means “sacred herb.”Hyssopus is linked to several folk medicinal uses, provid-ing several biologically active constituents especially themain compounds from essential oils. The essential oil is pri-marily consumed for flavoring, preservation of food, andother therapeutic uses [3].Essential oils from the plants are generally recognized assafe for consumption if consumed in limited or recom-mended doses. Hence, the safety profile of the hyssopextracts is important in various diseases. Hyssopus spp. pos-sessed curative properties against cough, cold, loss of appe-tite, fungal infection, and spasmodic condition. Essentialoil constituents also exhibited antimicrobial, antifungal,and muscle relaxant properties [4]. To the best of our knowl-edge, there is no literature review considering the essentialoils and their health-promoting effects and safety profile ofHyssopus genus.This comprehensive review provides insights into thechemical composition, method of extraction, pharmacologi-cal properties, adverse effects, and toxicological data ofessential oils extracted from Hyssopus officinalis.2.

The taxonomy of plants has been validated usingThe Plant List database (http://www.theplantlist.org/) [5, 6].3. Botanical Description and DistributionAmong the medicinal and aromatic plants, Hyssopus spp.have not been studied extensively. The known accepted spe-cies and subspecies are H. ambiguus, H. cuspidatus, H. latila-biatus, H. macranthus, H. officinalis, H. officinalis subsp.aristatus (Godr.) Nyman, H. officinalis subsp. canescens(DC.) Nyman, H. officinalis subsp. montanus (Jord. &Fourr.) Briq., H. seravschanicus, and H. subulifolius (Rech.f.)Rech.f. [7–11].The genus Hyssopus had six species that were used asherbal remedy like H. officinalis which is utilized as a condi-ment in a food factory and as a flavoring agent [12]. Theother five species were Hyssopus ambiguus (Trautv.) Iljinex Prochorov. & Lebel, Hyssopus cuspidatus Boriss, Hyssopuslatilabiatus C.Y.Wu & H.W.Li, Hyssopus macranthusBoriss., and Hyssopus seravschanicus (Dubj.) Pazij.The geographical distribution of Hyssopus spp. is shownin Table 1.Hyssopus officinalis is widespread in the Mediterraneancountries [14] and central Asia and north-west India [15].Traditionally, hyssop seedlings are transplanted into thefield with the first harvest occurring two years later, immedi-ately after bloom [16]. Several subspecies have been recordedespecially for Europe and northern Africa [17]. Nevertheless,several authors do not formally recognize any intraspecificranks within this taxon, stating that variations displayed bythe species are linked to local ecological conditions [18].The flowering tops and leaves are used as flavors in foodand beverages and cosmetic product preparations [19].Flowers are useful in attracting bees for pollination andmake them an important ornamental plant. Several types,differing in flower color, flowering time, and leaf shape are2 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevityavailable commercially: “alba” (white flowers), “grandiflora”(large flowers), “rosea” (rose flowers), and “rubia” (redflowers) [16].The essential oil from the herb is commonly used in cos-metics, perfumes, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, andfood additives. Dry leaves of hyssop are consumed as spicesand herbal tea [14]. The seeds are often mixed, and it is quitedifficult to obtain uniform plant populations for specificrequirements, such as decorative flower production, honeybee forage production, high volatile oil yield, and uniformquantitative oil composition.The reproduction is made by dividing clumps in latespring, towards April-May, or at the beginning of autumn.Seeds may be sown in March-April in calcareous light soil.The essential oil productivity ranges between 10 and20 kg/ha [20]. The productivity of essential oil varies greatlydepending on the variation in plant species. In fact, compar-ing 13 European sources of hyssop, the yield of fresh leavesranged from 5 to 32 tons/ha, and that of dry leaves from0.67 to 3.26 tons/ha [19].The inflorescence is 20-25 cm long, false spikelike, com-posed of 4 to 10 flowered pseudoverticils in the terminal[21]. Due to the high content of essential oils (0.3–1.0%),one of the most important species among Hyssopus is Hysso-pus officinalis L. H. (hyssop), frequently used as a drug in thepharma industry and as a functional ingredient in the foodindustry [1, 22].The root of H. officinalis is densely branched with a mul-tiheaded tap root. The stems are 0.5–0.7m in height, erect,or decumbent, dividing into many woody stems.The leaves are opposite, shiny dark-green, entire-edged,and lanceolate or oblong, obtuse to acuminate that are 2–4 cm long and 0.5–1 cm wide.The morphological and genetic hyssop complexitydescribes its high variability and the existence of numerousgeographically different subspecies [23, 24]. H. officinalis islargely cultivated but also found in the wild conditions, char-acterized by a high heterogeneity. The high intraspecificdiversity of hyssop is due to morphological differences (leaf,inflorescence, colour of flower, position, and form) and,especially, to biochemical traits (essential oils).4. Phytochemistry and Bioactive PrinciplesHyssop oil from different phenotypes or different areasshows great variability in chemical composition [25–28].The chemical composition can be related to many factors,such as the origin, geography, climate and technologicalinfluence, stages of development, parts used, and harvestingtime, as well as the presence of chemotypes [29].The characteristics of genus Hyssopus essential oil wereanalyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and GC analysis, and 21 compounds were identified,comprising 95.6% of oil. The compounds included six ses-quiterpenes (60.5%), one phenol (0.2%), seven monoterpenehydrocarbons (32.3%), and five oxygenated monoterpenes(60.5%) [30]. Pinocamphone (49.1%), isopinocamphone(9.7%), and β-pinene (18.4%) were the major monoterpeneconstituents [30, 31]. Joulain [32] for the first time identifiedthe constituents of genus Hyssopus that were cis-pinonic,hydroxyisopinocamphone, pinic acid, cis-pinic acid, myrte-nic acid, methyl myrtenate, and myrtenol methyl ether.The essential oil’s major components were β-pinene (10.5and 10.8%), pinocamphone (34 and 18.5%), camphor (0.3and 5.3%), linalool (0.2 and 7.9%), and isopinocamphone(3.2 and 29%).GC and GC-MS analysis of H. officinalis volatile oil fromSpain showed 1,8-cineole (52.89%) and β-pinene (16.82%)[26]. Özer et al. [9] performed GC analysis of H. officinalisfrom Turkey, with 34 components found, and they were91% of the total detected components. The major compo-nents were isopinocamphone (5.3%), pinocamphone(19.6%), pinocarvone (36.3%), β-pinene (10.6%), and 1,8-cineole (7.2%) [9, 33]. Hyssopus officinalis from the Alps inBanon, France, was analyzed for its essential oil components,its major components were α-pinene (2.4%), β-pinene(3.0%), limonene (5.4%), linalool (49.6%), 1,8-cineole(13.3%), and β-caryophyllene (2.8%), and minor compo-nents were pinocamphone and isopinocamphone [34].The Romanian’s H. officinalis oil contains mainly ali-phatic fatty acids like eicosadienoic acid (0.68%), linolenicacid (63.98%), arachidic acid (2.64%), stearic acid(10.73%), and palmitic acid (15.60%) [35]. But the plantsof genus Hyssopus of Iran possessed different constituentsand their concentration was found as bornyl acetate(1.42%), β-caryophyllene (2.10%), β-bourbonene (1.47%),camphor (6.76%), caryophyllene oxide (2.13%), spathulenol(2.14%), germacrene (3.39%), and myrtenyl acetate(74.08%) [36].Chemical analysis of the H. officinalis endemic in formerYugoslavia shows that the essential oils are composedmainly of cis- and trans-pinocamphone and pinocarvone,together with lesser amounts of germacrene D, bicycloger-macrene, elemol, and spathulenol [11].Table 1: Species and distribution area of Hyssopus spp. [13].Species Distribution areaHyssopus ambiguus (Trautv.)

Europe, Algeria, Morocco, IranHyssopus seravschanicus (Dub.) Pazij Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan3Oxidative Medicine and Cellular LongevityEssential oils isolated from plants of hyssop grown intwo different localities near Urbino (Italy) that showedmajor components were pinocamphone (34% and 18.5%),isopinocamphone (3.2% and 29%), and β-pinene (10.5%and 10.8%). The major differences in the composition ofthe oils were detectable in the ratio of pinocamphone/isopi-nocamphone, in the percentage of linalool (0.2% and 7.9%)and camphor (0.3% and 5.3%) [11].Oil from hyssop found in Poland contained 52 com-pounds, including 1 unidentified. The main components ofhyssop essential oil were isopinocamphone (22.53–28.74%),pinocamphone (11.41–17.99%), β-pinene (6.69–12.01%),elemol (5.02–7.57%), germacrene D (3.14–6.98%), and bicy-clogermacrene (2.55–4.36%) [37]. Garg et al. [30] found thatthe main volatile constituents of H. officinalis essential oilfrom a variety of locations included β-pinene, limonene, β-phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, pinocamphone, isopinocam-phone, pinocarvone, germacrene-D, and methyleugenol.They also found that the oils extracted from different sub-species or plant populations of varying origin or morphologydiffered in percentage composition of the major volatileconstituents.Said-Al Ahl et al. [38] from Egypt found that the majorconstituents of H. officinalis oil were cis-pinocamphone(26.85%), β-pinene (20.43%), trans-pinocamphone (15.97%),α-elemol (7.96%), durenol (3.11%), β-phellandrene (2.41%),caryophyllene (2.34%), (E)-2,6-dimethyl-1,3,5,7-octatetraene(2.27%), 3(10)-caren-4-ol, acetoacetic acid ester (2.14%),bicyclogermacrene (1.83%), myrtenol (1.73%), germacreneD (1.68%), limonene (1.56%), γ-eudesmol (1.36%), andlinalool (1.08%).Ahmadi et al. [39] conducted a study on improving theyield of essential oil from H. officinalis after first and secondharvest. It was concluded that citrulline application at therate of 2mM resulted in 15 and 30% of improvement inthe yield after the first and second harvest, respectively.The authors found that the application of 2mM of citrullineyielded 47% isopinocamphone as the dominant essential oilcomponent under severe drought from H. officinalis. Theprincipal components present in Hyssopus essential oil arepresented in Table 2.The main constituents of Hyssopus essential oils andtheir chemical structures are shown in Figure 1.5. Extraction Methods of Essential Oil fromHyssopus GenusHyssopus essential oils are usually extracted using traditionalmethod such as Soxhlet extraction and hydrodistillationwhereas nonconventional methods such as supercriticalfluid extraction (SFE), ultrasound-assisted extraction(UAE), and instant controlled pressure drop process (DIC)have been utilized recently to improve the yield of essentialoils from Hyssopus aerial plant parts [23].In a recent study, the essential oil components wereextracted using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2)extraction and Soxhlet extraction from 4 species of genusHyssopus (differentiated by the corolla color). The extractionshowed that the major components of genus Hyssopus spe-cies were pinocarvone, pinocamphone, and isopinocam-phone. SC-CO2 results showed a lesser presence ofmonoterpene hydrocarbons and a high amount of oxygen-ated hydrocarbons [44].In a recent study, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) wasused for the extraction of essential oil components from hys-sop and yielded pinocamphone in the concentration of 0.7 to13.6%, sabinene (4.2 to 17.1%), and iso-pinocamphone (0.9to 16.5%). For the highest extraction of isopinocamphoneand pinocamphone, the optimized conditions were 45°Ctemperature; 100 atmospheric pressure, with methanol4.5μL (0.14% w/w); 25min static extraction time; and20min dynamic extraction time [45]. The authors concludedthat input factors such as pressure, temperature, static anddynamic time, and modifier affect the extraction of essentialoil components from Hyssopus.Kazazi and Rezaei [46] collected hyssop from Iran whichafter analysis showed the presence of a high concentration ofsabinene (11.04%). The major compounds of both extractionsSFE and Soxhlet extraction in comparison were β-pinene (1 to6%), terpinene-4-ol (4 to 10%), and 1, 8-cineol (eucalyptol)(60 to 75%) [47, 48]. The extraction methods, agrotechnicalfactors, climatic parameters, and from one growing season toTable 2: Principal bioactive compounds of Hyssopus essential oil.Plant materialEssentialoil yieldPrincipal component of essential oil Region ReferenceAir-dried aerial parts 1.2%Cis-pinocamphone (21.59%), trans-pinocamphone (7.93%),elemol (7.12%), bicyclogermacrene (6.58%), germacrene D (6.52%),limonene (6.36%), β-pinene (5.20%), trans-caryophyllene (4.65%)Iran [40]Aerial parts 0.18%Myrtenyl acetate (74.08%), camphor (6.76%), germacrene (3.39%),spathulenol (2.14%), caryophyllene oxide (2.13%), β-caryophyllene (2.10%),cis- sabinol (1.75%), β-bourbonene (1.47%), bornyl acetate (1.42%)Iran [39]Fresh aerial part(stem with inflorescence)0.47% Pinocamphone 19.8%, β − pinene ≤ 20:5%, iso-pinocamphone 24.6% Spain [3, 41]Aerial part (blue flowers) 0.36%Hedycaryol ≤ 9:1%, germacreneD ≤ 5:5%, β − pinene ≤ 11:4%,isopinocamphone ≤ 33:6%, pinocarvone ≤ 28:1%EastLithuania[41, 42]Aerial parts 0.4%Limonene ≤ 9:8%, germacreneD ≤ 11:3%, 1, 8 − cineole ≤ 11:9%,pinocamphone ≤ 64:9%, β − pinene ≤ 32:4% India [41, 43]4 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevityanother were the factors that vary the essential oil content ofextract [27, 49–51].In another study, essential oil from H. officinalis wasextracted using an instant controlled pressure drop process(DIC). GC-MS analysis showed that 65% of total constitu-ents of chromatogram were cis-pinocamphone (21.59%),trans-pinocamphone (7.93%), elemol (7.12%), bicyclogerma-crene (6.58%), germacrene D (6.52%), limonene (6.36%), β-pinene (5.20%), and trans-caryophyllene (4.65%). Essentialoil components such as linalool, 3-octanone, α-pinene, andα-thujene were detected in abundance in DIC compared tothe hydrodistillation and ultrasound-assisted extraction.6. Biological ActivitiesThe essential oil and the extracts isolated from plants dem-onstrated average in vitro antibacterial activity, antimycoticinsect killing, and antiviral properties [52, 53]. Hyssopessential oil extracts showed excellent antioxidant and anti-cancer activities [28, 54], although there is significant poten-tial that has yet to be investigated [55, 56].6.1. Antimicrobial, Antifungal, and Antiviral. The essentialoil of Hyssopus contains β-pinene, iso pinocamphone, terpi-nene-4-ol, carvacrol, pinocarvone, pinocamphone, and p-cymene compounds with antimicrobial properties, whichcould be used to new drug development for therapy or pro-phylaxis against human infectious diseases [57]. In a recentstudy, hyssop essential oil demonstrated activity againstpathogenic microbes against Staphylococcus aureus, Escheri-chia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus hauseri, Listeria monocyto-genes, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria ivanovii, Salmonellaenteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Bacil-lus spizizenii [58].Hyssopus officinalis essential oil holds antifungal activitywhich is particularly efficient in the reduction of the expan-sion of fungal species such as Candida krusei, Candida albi-cans, and Candida tropicalis [10, 58]. The MIC of H.officinalis essential oil in a liquid medium for yeast wasbetween 0.15 and 0.3%. The essential oil also exhibited anti-mycotic activity against 10 yeast and fungi and C. albicans inthe range of 15.625 to 250μL/mL [59]. In Serbia, the mush-room Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach was destroyed bythe fungus Mycogone perniciosa (Mang); in 2005, theresearch was conducted to find out the antifungal agent toinhibit its growth.Then, the essential oil of H. officinalis was tested for itsantiperniciosa activity; the results showed minimal fungi-cidal activity of about 15 to 20μL/mL and MIC about5μL/mL [60]. Then, aromatic plants were tested for theirantifungal activity, to enhance the growth of mushroom[60, 61]. Then, from the aromatic plants of Mediterraneanarea, 12 essential oils were tested against four fungi, whichwere Penicillium Italicum, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizopus stoloni-fer, and Phytophthora citrophthora. The conclusion revealedthat the hyssop oil exhibited weak to moderate fungicideactivity but they could act as a food product preservative[4]. By using the agar diffusion method, H. officinalis essen-tial oil showed complete growth inhibition of Aspergillusniger in concentrations between 0.5 and 1.5% [62].Hyssopus officinalis dried leaf extract also showed effi-cacy in the replication inhibition of HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) [63].6.2. Antioxidant. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid(ABTS) assays are generally used for measuring the antioxi-dant activity of the plant extracts. Hyssop essential oilreported lower antioxidant activity against DPPH (1.21μmolTrolox equivalent (TE)/g) and reported approximately tentimes higher scavenging activity towards ABTS (10.6μmolTE/g) [15].In another study, the hyssop extracts from Serbia andTurkey showed an IC50 value of 156.60mg/mL and16.37mg/mL [8, 57]. The differences in the antioxidantproperties are due to genetic factors, environmental condi-tions, and geographic origin [28]. Antioxidant activity ofthe hyssop essential oil attributed towards the chelatingpower of transition metals.

Anticancer/Cytotoxic. Natural products are a rich sourceof compounds with many applications in cancer chemother-apy [65–67]. Moreover, the broad spectrum of natural com-pounds provides important compounds for therapeuticrefinement through molecular modifications [68, 69].Hyssop extracts were evaluated for anticancer activityagainst human cancer cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay[15]. Authors utilized human breast cancer (MDA-MB 231),malignant melanoma (A375), and human colon cancer(HCT116 lines) cell lines for their investigation. The essen-tial oil extracts from hyssop showed a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect against cancer cell lines. Theyreported IC50 values of 62.66, 35.16, and 29.91μg/mLMDS-MB 231, A375, and HCT116 cell lines, respectively.High antioxidant activity was suggested to be due to thecomponents of hyssop essential oil such as linalool andmethyl eugenol. In another study, Hyssopus essential oilsshowed antitumor activity against tumor cells lines (HeLa,MRC-5, and MDA-MB231) [28]. On the same way, H. offi-cinalis subsp. aristatus shows slight cytotoxicity towards theA549 cell line (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epi-thelial cells) [70].The cytotoxicity of marrubiin was studied in 66 cancercell lines without showing toxic activity; however, in vivo,an LD50 of 370mg/kg body weight for marrubiin hadbeen documented [71]. Recent studies have shown a safetylimit of up to 100mg/kg body weight when injected intomice [72].6.4. Mosquito Larvicidal Activity. Mosquitoes are one of theemerging causes of death in developing and underdevelopedcountries. Control of mosquito vectors is a challenging taskdue to environmental concerns and the development of pes-ticide resistance. Hence, researchers are in search of newbotanicals for the control of mosquito-related diseases suchas malaria, chikungunya, Zika virus, and dengue [73].Essential oil of H. officinalis demonstrated lethal concen-tration (LC50) values more than 90μL/L in an acute toxicityresearch study against double blends of Culex quinquefascia-tus agent, a vector of lymphatic filariasis, maintaining it asenvironment-friendly, efficient, and inexpensive mosquitolarva killer [74]. The study is crucial for the developmentof newer and safer mosquitocidal biopesticides for the con-trol of mosquito-borne diseases.6.5. Miorelaxation Activity. An experiment was carried outfor testing the sedative and simulative effect of essential oilby inhaling in mouse forced swimming test [75]. The hyssopessential oil inhalation increased the sessile state, and thiscondition was artificially overagitated by caffeine parenteralinjection. The result showed that hyssop essential oil couldproduce a sedative effect [75].Lu et al. [76] designed an experiment for evaluation ofthe myorelaxant effect of H. officinalis essential oil on theintestinal muscle sample of rabbit and guinea pigs. Themyorelaxing effect of essential oil was due to its componentisopinocamphone. BaCl2 was involved in myocontraction inthe ileum (IC50 = 48:3 and 70.4μg/mL), and isopinocam-phone did myorelaxation by the inhibition of acetylcholineon ileum muscles (IC50 42.4 and 61.9μg/mL).H. officinalis oil contains limonene and β-pinene whichproduced no effect on muscle contraction, but the synergiceffect of components could not be excluded. The researchersbelieved that hyssop oil could induce myorelaxation after thealteration of ion channels and interaction with plasma mem-brane. The synergic activity of components of essential oildepended upon chemical structure, lipophilic nature, andsubcomponents of essential oil such as interaction of β-pinene and limonene [76].A recent study of extract of H. officinalis on seizuresinduced by pentylenetetrazole and hippocampus mRNAlevel of iNOS in rats found that 100mg/kg dose of hyssopextract might have anticonvulsant effects. However, theseanticonvulsant effects might not occur through the iNOSgene expression [77].The biological activities of Hyssopus spp. essential oilsare summarized in Figure 2.7. Safety Data and Adverse EffectsA survey of the literature documented essential oils of hys-sop and other 10 plants: eucalyptus, fennel, hyssop, penny-royal, rosemary, sage, savin, tansy, thuja, turpentine, andwormwood, to be powerful convulsants due to their contentof highly reactive monoterpene ketones, such as camphor,pinocamphone, thujone, cineole, pulegone, sabinyl acetate,and fenchone. The hyssop essential oil contains one or moreoxygenated monoterpenes, such as pinocamphone.The epileptogenic properties of these convulsants havebeen well established and studied in animals [78]. Theymay interact with and exert pharmacological action on cen-tral nervous system targets involved in epilepsy [79, 80]. Itwas shown by electrocorticographic records that Wistarrats, after injection of 80mg/kg hyssop essential oil, developsubclinical generalized sustained high-voltage spikes.Increasing the dose to 1.25 g/kg leads to rhythmic myoclo-nus, subsequently to one or several tonics, clonic, ortonic-clonic seizures, and eventually lethal convulsive status. Sim-ilar results were obtained with half these doses of pinocam-phone that produced seizures when used both internallyand topically [81]. Also, a carvone derivative, hydroxydihydrocarvone that increases seizure latency at high doses,may come with negative side effects, including palpebralptosis, decreased response to touch, and decreased motoractivity [82].Hyssop essential oil modulates structures involved in neu-rotransmitter release and metabolism such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA), gamma-aminobutyric acid typeA (GABAA) and type B (GABAB), glycine, and acetylcholinereceptors, as well as the acetylcholine esterase and GABAtransaminase enzymes. Hyssop essential oils also modulatevoltage-gated sodium and calcium channels and affect neuro-nal excitability and action potential dynamics. Another key6 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevityproperty is the inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)of hyssop essential oil [79].Other possible side effects of hyssop include allergicreactions. It can irritate the respiratory tract due to vexationof mucous and bronchospasm by marrubiin—another com-ponent of hyssop essential oil.Hyssop oils are often used in medical aromatherapy, likeother plant oils from the Lamiaceae: basil, lavender, pepper-mint, rosemary, or thyme. However, the side effects of aro-matherapy have been suppressed or refuted by manyinexpert aromatherapists to date. According to Yoo [83],the most common complication among 3000 aromatherapypatients recorded was a cutaneous adverse reaction, occur-ring in 0.99% of all participants. Most of these cases aredeemed contact dermatitis caused by an essential oil. Thesecond most common complication was asthmatic symp-toms, early menstruation, arrhythmia, and oliguria.No clinical trials have been conducted on hyssop essen-tial oil adverse effects in humans. Reports are only from clin-ical research data obtained from hospitals [79]. Themetabolites of principal active ingredients of hyssop: cis-and trans-3-pinanones, were examined from mouse andhuman liver microsomes by Höld et al. [33]. The majormetabolites of cis-3-pinanone were 2-hydroxy-cis-3-pina-none and two minor metabolites. These compounds exhib-ited reduced toxicity but also acted as GABAA receptorantagonists. The urine from oral cis-3-pinanone treatmentcontained conjugates of metabolites and 2,10-dehydro-3-pinanone. Trans-3-pinanone has slower metabolization thancis-isomer and produces different hydroxy derivatives.8. LimitationsIn general, at the right dose, hyssop does not have adverseeffects and toxicity. However, most of the herbs are safewhen used in moderation, but excessive consumption canproduce unknown effects [84]. For this fact, hyssop is noexception. This herb is believed to be relatively safe at levelscommonly used in foods. The appropriate dose of hyssopdepends on several factors such as the user’s age, health,and several other conditions. At this time, there is notenough scientific information to determine an appropriaterange of doses for this plant. However, at high doses, hyssopoil may be dangerous due to various other side effects,mainly drowsiness, seizures, and sensory effects associatedwith psychological disorders.Although herbal products may offer a benefit, it isimportant to detect even small risks that would significantlyaffect the risk-benefit ratio in pregnancy. There is very littleresearch on how hyssop products may affect pregnancy (itmight cause the uterus to contract or start menstruation).Although hyssop products may offer a benefit, it isimportant to detect even small risks that would significantlyaffect the risk. In addition, herb interactions with conven-tional medications may provoke undesirable effects. Severalinteractions have been described between herbal drugs andantidepressants or psycholeptics [85].Despite the promising medical effects achieved in vari-ous researches, yet further detailed studies are required tobetter clarify the side effect of hyssop. The use of herbalmedications does not have strict regulations.

Biological activities of Hyssopus essential oils7Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevityis still poorly recognized and underestimated [78]. Sinceherbal medicines are a part of traditional medicine, theyare not included in the FDA or EFSA categories giving afalse impression of safety.Therefore, in general, there is a need for the regulation ofhyssop drugs to ensure their safety and determine the effi-cacy and constituents of the preparations [84]. Physiciansshould consider balancing the risks and benefits of comple-mentary and alternative medicine using hyssop and its activecompounds [86].9. Overall ConclusionsHyssopus essential oils are usually extracted using conven-tional methods such as hydrodistillation. However, recently,nonconventional methods such as SFE, UAE, and DIC aregetting popularized due to higher extraction efficienciescompared to conventional methods. Most of the recent andolder studies used GC and GC-MS techniques for qualitativeand quantitative characterization of the essential oil from theHyssopus genus. The genus Hyssopus had essential constitu-ents which perform multiple actions. Its essential oil constit-uents possessed curative properties against cough, loss ofappetite, fungal infection, spasmodic condition, and potentantimicrobial activities. The other in vivo actions are the sed-ative effects, plasma membrane relaxation, and cytotoxicactivity. Biological activities and aroma from essential oilsuggest its use as a potential antioxidant food ingredientand other pharmaceutical drugs.At the same time, well-designed clinical trials examiningthe described characteristics of hyssop extracts and possibleadverse reactions are still not investigated and need morestudies to complete whether biological differences in resultsof the researches reverse the various types of plant materialused, different procedures of isolation, different chemotypes,collection time, and locations. Further, molecular insightsinto various biological activities of essential oil from Hysso-pus genus need to be explored in more depth.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors’ ContributionsJSR and WCC conceived the review.
