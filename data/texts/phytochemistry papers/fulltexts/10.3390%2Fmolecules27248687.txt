Thepresent review sheds light on the ethnopharmacology, phytoconstituents, bioactivity, and toxicologyof the Onosma species from previous investigations. Furthermore, the paper also highlights theunresolved issues for the future investigations. The review included previous studies of the genusOnosma available from Google Scholar and Baidu Scholar, Science Direct, SciFinder, Wiley OnlineLibrary, and Web of Science. Until now, more than 200 chemical compounds have been detected fromthe genus Onosma, including naphthoquinone (33), flavonoids (30), hydrocarbon (23), phenolic (22),ester (17), alkaloids (20), aromatics (12), carboxylic acid (11), fatty acids (9), terpenoids (10), while themost important ones are rosmarinic, ferulic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric acids,and apigenin. The Onosma species are reported as traditional medicine for wound healing, heartdisease, and kidney disorders, while the pharmacological investigations revealed that the extracts andthe phytochemicals of Onosma species have different therapeutic properties including antioxidant,enzyme inhibitory, antitumor, hepatoprotective, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobialactions. The summarized knowledge in this review provides valuable ideas for the current and futuredrug discovery and a motivation for further investigation on the genus Onosma.Keywords: Onosma; ethnobotany; phytochemistry; data mining; pharmacological activity; toxicology1. IntroductionThe genus Onosma comprises more than 230 species across the globe. The Asian continenthas the highest share in terms of Onosma species existence [1], most of which are representedin Turkey by 88 species [2] followed by countries such as Iran and China by 58 [3] and29 species [4], respectively. Iraqi Kurdistan represents 32 species of the genus Onosma basedon the latest botanical studies [5]. However, recent investigations have revealed seven newspecies of Onosma in Asian countries, particularly Iran [6]. Continuous exploration on theethnobotanical and plant taxonomy studies led to the discovery of several new Onosma speciesacross our continent [7,8]. Some Onosma species have been well studied pharmacologicallythan others, and the most common ones are shown in Figure 1.Molecules 2022, 27, 8687. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27248687 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2022, 27, 8687 2 of 26Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 27   by 58 [3] and 29 species [4], respectively. Iraqi Kurdistan represents 32 species of the genus Onosma based on the latest botanical studies [5]. However, recent investigations have revealed seven new species of Onosma in Asian countries, particularly Iran [6]. Continuous exploration on the ethnobotanical and plant taxonomy studies led to the discovery of several new Onosma species across our continent [7,8]. Some Onosma species have been well studied pharmacologically than others, and the most common ones are shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1. Representative example of the most-studied species of the genus Onosma in terms of pharmacology actions. The ethnobotanical and in vitro studies have revealed that most of this Onosma species has many medicinal capabilities such as sedatives [9], antioxidant [10], anti-inflammatory [11], gastric disorders [11], antithrombotic [12], wound healing [13], Alzheimer [14], enzyme inhibitory [15], anti-tumor [16], anti-viral [17], antifungal [18], and COVID-19 curatives [19] (Figure 2). The phytochemical studies on the genus Onosma have reported several chemical compounds as their main active ingredients, including naphthaquinones (5,8-dihydroxy-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl) naphthalene-1,4-dione) [16], Phenolics (ferulic acid, vanillic acid), flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin) [10,20], alkannin, and shikonines (deoxyshikonin, isobutyrylshikonin, α-methylbutyrylshikonin, acetylshikonin) [21,22]. The past decades have showed numerous new records, phytochemical, and pharmacological studies of the new Onosma species, and the published two reviews were found lacking integrity as they contained incoherent data with skipping of some biological activities of the genus Onosma [23,24]. Therefore, in order to provide theoretical reference for further research and to comprehensively understand the medicinal applications of this genus, this article systematically reviewed traditional uses, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, and clinical applications of the Onosma species based on the published literature. i r 1.

Traditional Use The folkloric use of many Onosma species as medicinal plants for different health problems by local ethnic groups in several countries such as Iraq, Turkey, Iran, China, and India roots back to hundreds of years ago. Almost all plant parts, such as leaves, roots, underground parts, flowers, and the whole plant of this genus species are reported to have a broad range of therapeutic potentials (Table 2) [32,33]. Species such as Onosma alborosea have traditionally been utilized by Iraqi Kurdistan populations as a remedy for sedative, heart diseases, and kidney disorders through ingesting its aerial part extracts prepared by aqueous extraction methods [33]. The aerial parts of Onosma orientalis has been macerated with hot water for treating sedatives by Kurdish nations living in Iraqi Kurdistan [33]. Furthermore, the O. armeniacum K. has been used as Turkish folkloric medicine for healing wounds, peptic ulcers, burns, dyspnea, hoarseness, hemorrhoids, and abdominal pains through methods of cooking and filtration of its roots with butter [34]. The extracts (oil and aqueous extracts) of O. argentatum and O. chlorotricum has been traditionally utilized in Turkey and Iran (Lorestan province) for the treatment of wounds and cutaneous injures [35,36]. Furthermore, the root extracts of O. hispidum Wall. have been used traditionally by the Iranian nation as curatives for headache, wounds, insect stings, bits, and Figure 3.

Almost all plant part , such as leaves, roots, under-ground parts, flowers, and the whole plant of thi genus species are reported to have abroad range of therapeutic pote tials (Table 2) [32,33]. Species such as Onosma alborosea havetraditionally been utilized by Iraqi Kurdist n populations as a remedy for sedative, heartdiseases, and kidney disorders through ingesting its aerial p rt extr cts prepared by aqueousextraction m thods [33].

The extracts ( il and aqueous extracts) ofO. argentatum and O. chlorotricum has been traditionally utilized in Turkey and Iran (Lorestanprovince) for the treatment of wounds and cutaneous injures [35,36]. Furthermore, the rootextracts of O. hispidum Wall. have been used traditionally by the Iranian nation as curativesfor headache, wounds, insect stings, bits, and inflammatory diseases, while its flowers havebeen ingested for cardiovascular problems [37]. Moreover, same species has been used as adye and as a substitute for alkanet [38]. The O. bracteatum Wall. extracts have been reported astraditional herbal medicine as a tonic agent for improving the body’s immune system withenhancing regulation of urine output [39]. The O. bracteatum Wall. also has been used asremedy for asthma, respiratory problems, tonic, alterative, demulcent, diuretic, spasmolytic,Molecules 2022, 27, 8687 5 of 26rheumatoid arthritis, diuretic, and antileprotic in India, Nepal, Kashmir, and northwesternHimalayas countries [40,41]. The root extracts of O. sericeum have been traditionally used incream preparations for skin injuries and burn scar treatments in Adıyaman, Turkey [13].The O. microcarpum has traditional medicine record for the healing of wounds andburn scars by rural residents of Il’yca district, Erzurum, Turkey [36,42]. The leaf aqueousextracts of O. echioides DC. are prepared for children suffering from constipation andmetabolic disorders. Meanwhile, its flowers are reported as a cordial and as a stimulant fororthopedic and cardiac problems [43]. The dried roots of O. paniculata have a traditionalmedicinal record in Chinese herbal medicine for curing several human diseases includingtumors [44]. The O. aucheriana is another species with traditional medicinal usage foritchiness, leucoderma, bronchitis, abdominal pain, strangury, fever, wounds, burns, andurinary calculi. Meanwhile, its flowers have been highlighted as stimulants and cardio-tonics, and its leaf extracts have been ingested as laxatives, purgatives, and as woundcuratives [45]. Out of more than 230 species of Onosma, only 12 species were reportedin traditional medicines as herbal medicine until now. This could be due to the largegeographical distribution of the Onosma species and lack of scientific interest in the past, butthis number is expected to increase in upcoming years as the researchers extensively searchand investigate for other Onosma species after discovering some interesting phytochemicaland pharmacological potentials of this genus in recent years.Table 2.

Chemical Profile of Onosma SpeciesThe current systematic review of the phytochemical contents of Onosma speciespresents major identified organic classes such as naphthoquinone (33), flavonoids (30), hy-drocarbon (23), phenolic (22), ester (17), alkaloids (20), terpenoids (10), carboxylic acid (11),fatty acids (9), aromatics (12), and liganin (5) compounds as shown in Figure 4. In addition,miscellaneous chemicals such as 24,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol, 5-hydroxymethyl-furoicacid, and uplandicine also enrich the diversity of the phytochemistry in Onosma plants.Segregation of phytochemical contents in different classes is challenging and not always aclear and easy task. According to the current search, a total of 198 compounds are detectedin the Onosma species as detailed in this review (Table 3), and this will open up new fu-ture study opportunities to explore pharmacological potentials of those phytochemicals.Most common Onosma compounds reported were rosmarinic acid, apigenin, ferulic acid,protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, luteolin,hyperoside, hesperidin, apigenin-7-Glucoside, luteolin-7, glucoside, isovalerylshikonin,acetylshikonin, pinoresinol, deoxyshikonin, 4, hydroxybenzoic acid, β,β-dimethylacryl,isovalerylshikonin, 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic, and 3-Hydroxybenzoic acid as presented inFigure 5.Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 27    Figure 4.

Toxicity In Vivo ExperimentThe chloroform and ethanolic extracts of O. aucheranum, O. isauricum O. sericeum, O. tau-ricum, and O. tauricum were safe in the administered doses from 100 mg/kg to 200 mg/kgbased on the assessment of acute toxicity in the carrageenan-induced paw edema experi-ment as no abnormality in the morbidity nor mortality was recorded after 24 hours posttreatment [73]. Furthermore, the 100, 200, 300, and 600 mg/kg of the MeOH of O. mutabilisadministration to rats showed no changes in the appearance, behavior, and feed intake ofthe rats in a 7-day experiment [16]. Moreover, by the tarsal toxicity test, researchers haveshown the acaricidal activity of the root extracts of O. visianii experimented against Tetranychusurticae mites in bean plants (P. vulgaris var. Carmen) after 24 h (considered as acute toxicity),which caused significant mortality of T. urticae adults with lethal doses 83.2 and 112.6 µg·cmcausing 50% (LD50) and 90% (LD90) inhibition of oviposition, respectively. However, at 5 days(considered as chronic toxicity) from the start of the test, the lethal dose LD50 was more than30 times lower (2.6 µg·cm−2) as a function of time used in the LD50 calculation [60]. Overthe last two decades, several Onosma species have been tested for their toxicity to laboratoryanimal models. A study on toxicity of the bark extracts of O. echioides roots to Sprague Dawleyrats (140 ± 10 g body weight) was performed and reported significant improvement in thebody weight, food consumption, water intake, serum glucose, hematology, and biochemistryof rats with no adverse effect at a fixed dose [74].8.2. Genotoxicity and MutagenicityThrough the Allium-test, significant genotoxic effect from aqueous extracts of O. stellulataroots and aerial parts were observed in mitosis at meristematic cells of onion. Although theaerial parts showed significant genotoxicity after 4-h treatment (mitotic index was 2, 79%, vs. 9,18% for control), but the root aqueous extracts had higher genotoxic effects. Genotoxic effectsincluded changes in the structure of chromosomes (conglutination, spirality), and cytotoxicreaction and certain differentiation in the cell cycle, which were found to be in correlation withduration of treatment and solution concentration [75]. A genotoxic study by Allium anaphase–telophase assay reported that the safety of the ethanolic extract of O. aucheriana aerial parts atlower dose (62.5 mg/mL) had no toxic or genotoxic effects, while the higher dose (500 mg/mL)showed significantly the highest genotoxic effect including chromosomal aberrations, cellswith multipolarity, cell bridges, and vagrant chromosomes (24.4%), cell fragments, and mitosisentrance [76]. In vivo genotoxic study of methanolic extracts of O. sericea and O. stenolobaat different doses (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 µg/mL) against EMS-induced DNA damage inthe flies and larvae of the wild-type strain of Drosophila melanogaster showed the absenceof genotoxic effect of O. sericea and O. stenoloba at concentration 80 mg/mL. Furthermore,significant antigenotoxic effects reported after dual treatment with 80 mg/mL of both plantextracts plus EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate) caused significant decrease in DNA damage (withover 80% reduction) [15]. By using Ames assay, the antimutagenic potential of ethanolic extractof O. bracteatum has been reported against sodium azide and 2-aminofluorene mutagenicityin Salmonella typhimurium in TA100 strain (-S9 mix) as it displayed significant inhibition rate(82.30% at 250 mg/0.1 mL/plate), showing strong modulation of genotoxicity of base-pairsubstitution mutagen sodium azide when compared to NPD (frameshift mutagen) in TA98tester strain. The O. bracteatum extracts showed significant antimutagenicity activity forpreincubation mode than in co-incubation approach without -S9 in both TA100 and TA98 [77].9. Pharmacological Activity of the Onosma Species9.1. Antibacterial ActivityThe essential oils isolated from roots of O. sieheana showed appreciable antibacterialactivity against gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli (MIC: 125 µg/mL) and Pseudomonasaeruginosa (MIC: 125 µg/mL) and gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus (MIC:125 µg/mL) and Bacillus subtilis (MIC: 250 µg/mL)) [78]. The n-hexane–dichloromethanemixture extracts of O. argentatum roots showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus sub-Molecules 2022, 27, 8687 17 of 26tilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values 28, 13, and 32 µg/mL,respectively [18]. The chloroform fraction of O. khyberianum whole plant parts showedsignificant antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, and Vibriocholera inhibition zone 28, 26, 26 mm, respectively. Ethanol fraction of O. khyberianumdemonstrated significant antiradical activity against Shigella dysenteriae (21 mm) and Vibriocholera (20 mm), while the least active fraction of O. khyberianum n-hexane showed activityagainst Vibrio cholera, S. aureus, and Shigella dysenteriae (inhibition zone: 12, 9, 8 mm, re-spectively) but completely inactive against Salmonella and E. coli [79]. The crude ethanolicextracts of O. hispidum roots showed significant antibacterial activity against several grampositive and gram negative bacteria (Corynebacterium diphtheria, C. diphtheriticum, Micro-coccus lysodiecticus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecalis2400, E. faecium, Streptococcus pneumonia, and S. pyogenes) with inhibition zone range be-tween 18–20 mm [52]. The isolated naphtshoquinones (deoxyshikonin, isobutyrylshikonin,α- methylbutyrylshikonin, acetylshikonin, β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin, 5,8-O-dimethylisobutyrylshikonin, and 5,8-O-dimethyl deoxyshikonin) from O. visanii roots showed sig-nificant antibacterial activity against gram negative bacteria (Citrobacter koseri, Hafnia alvei,maltophilia, Yersinia intermedia, Ps. proteolytica, and Stenotrophomonas) and gram positivebacteria (Bacillus megaterium, Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, Microbacterium arborescens,and Micrococcus luteus) with MIC50 and MIC90 values between range 4.27–68.27 µg/mLand 4.77–76.20 µg/mL, respectively [61]. The antibacterial activity (MIC values) frommethanol extract of aerial parts of O. sericea and O. stenoloba were between 2.5−10 mg/mL.Both Onosma extracts had moderate antibacterial activity only on a few strains, namelyA. chroococcum and E. coli with MIC values 2.5 and 5 mg/L, respectively. O. sericea extractexhibited low activity on gram positive strain M. lysodeikticus with MIC 10 mg/mL, whileO. stenoloba extract showed notable antibacterial action on E. faecalis and A. tumefaciens withMIC values 5 and 10 mg/mL, respectively [15].9.2. Antifungal ActivityAntifungal activity of methanolic extracts of O. sericea and O. stenoloba aerial partsagainst fungal strains Phialophare fastigiata and Fusarium oxysporum has been reported as2.5 and 5 µg/mLof MIC, respectively. Furthermore, the methanol extracts of O. sericeaexhibited moderate activity (MIC range of 2.5−5 µg/mL) on Penicillium canescens FSB 24and P. cyclopium FSB 23, while O. stenoloba had antifungal activity only against P. cyclopium(MIC 10 µg/mL). Moreover, the same study showed antifungal potentials (MIC 10 µg/mL)of O. sericea against Trichoderma longibrachiatum FSB 13 and Trichoderma harzianum FSB 12.Meanwhile, increased concentration (10 µg/mL) of Onosma extracts showed inactivityagainst Aspergillus niger FSB 31, Aspergillus glaucus FSB 32, Doratomyces stemonitis FSB 41,Phialophora fastigiata FSB 81, Alternaria alternata FSB 51, and Fusarium oxysporum FSB 91 [15].The methanol extracts from aerial parts of O. griffithii exhibit antifungal activity againstAspergillus flavus (55%) and Fusarium solani (40%). Meanwhile, the chloroformic extractsshowed better antifungal activity against A. flavus (59%) and Fusarium solani (60%) [17].The antifungal activity of O. kheberianum against three fungal strains, Fusarium oxysporum,Alternaria alternate, and A. flavus were reported as 18, 13, and 7 mm, respectively, for ethanolfractions and 17, 11, and 9 mm, respectively, for chloroform fractions [79]. A previousstudy also showed a lack of antifungal activity of n-hexane–dichloromethane extracts ofO. argentatum roots against Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton interdigitale, Microphytongypseum, and Candida albicans [18]. The essential oils from O. sieheana Hayek roots showedsignificant antifungal activity against yeast strains Candida glabrata and C. albicans, andthe authors linked this activity with their phytoconstituents, namely Monoterpenes, suchas cymene and thymol [80]. The essential oils from O. chlorotricum roots exhibit higherantifungal activity (21 and 19.3 mean of inhibition zones (mm) against C. albicans andC. glaberata, respectively) than that of essential oils from O. microcarpum roots [80]. TheO. paniculatum cells showed strong response to fungal elicitors from Aspergillus sp., in anMolecules 2022, 27, 8687 18 of 26attempt to accelerate shikonin derivative formation and inversely arrest plant cell growth,which resulted in a slight change in shikonin contents [81].9.3. Antioxidant ActivityOnosma species have been comprehensively studied and researchers have revealed thatthey are a promising resources of antioxidants using various types of extraction and solventmethods [14,82,83].

Additionally, all compounds except5,8-O-Dimethyl deoxyshikonin, and 5,8-O-Dimethyl isobutyrylshikonin reduced viabilityof MDA-MB-231 cells after 48 h of incubation. Furthermore, α-methylbutyrylshikonindemonstrated the higher anticancer activity against HCT116 cells (IC50: 15.2 µg/mL) thanthat 97.8 µg/mL, 24.6 µg/mL and 30.9 µg/mL of Deoxyshikonin, Acetylshikonin, andβ-Hydroxyisovalerylshikonin, respectively [61]. The effect of Onosma bracteatum has beenstudied against different cancer cell lines and the results showed that various concentrations(0.055, 0.11, 0.22, 0.44, 0.88, 1.7, and 3.52 µg/mL) of O. bracteatum decreased viability of cellsin a time- and dose-dependent protocol [84].

Meanwhile, the superiority of petroleum ether extracts has been linkedwith its higher polyphenolic contents [85].9.5.2. Alzheimer’s DiseaseThe protective effect of Onosma species against Alzheimer’s disease was reported de-pending on its inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase(BChE) enzymes. The ethyl acetate extraction of aerial parts of O. gigantea showed higherAChE and BChE inhibitory activity (2.76 and 6.87 µmol/g, respectively) than that (31.57and 1.82 µmol/g, respectively) of methanol extracts [53]. The isolated hispidone and (2S)-5,2-dihydroxy-7,5-dimethoxyflavanone from methanol extractions of whole plant partsof O. hispida showed significant inhibitory activity against AChE (11.6 and 15.7 mg/mL,respectively) and BChE (28.0 and 7.9 mg/mL, respectively) enzymes [38]. The aerialpart extracts of O. lycaonica and O. papillosa exhibited significant AChE inhibition activity(IC50:1.32 and increased BChE inhibitory activity (2.31 ± 0.04 and 2.07 ± 0.1 (2.31 ± 0.04and 2.07 ± 0.08 mg GALAEs/g extracts), respectively [48]. The MeOH extraction ofO. rigidum aerial parts showed higher AChE and lower BChE inhibitory activity than that ofO. trapezuntea extracts [50]. O. sericea aerial part extracts showed higher inhibitory activityon AChE (3.74 mg/g) and BChE (0.51 mg/g) than that (4.34 and 3.44 mg/g) for O. stenoloba,respectively [15].9.5.3. Anti-Tyrosinase ActivityTyrosinase enzymes are well-known for their participation in melanin biosynthesis,and hypersecretion accompanied by accumulation of melanin pigments may lead to hyper-pigmentation disorders and photo carcinogenesis [87]. The ethyl acetate partition of aerialparts of O. gigantea showed higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity (0.15 µmol/g) than that(0.49 and 10.48µmol/g) of methanol and water extracts, respectively [53]. The tyrosinase in-hibitory activity of methanol extracts of O. aucheriana aerial parts was higher (2.19 mg/mL)than that (2.23 and 2.40 mg/mL) of O. sericea and O. frutescence, respectively [49]. TheMolecules 2022, 27, 8687 21 of 26methanol partition of aerial parts of O. ambigens showed higher tyrosinase inhibitory ac-tivity (2.81 mg/mL) than that (3.79 and 4.45 mg/mL) of water and ethyl acetate extracts,respectively [30].

The ethyl acetate extracts of O. isauricumshowed higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity (19.96 mg/g kojic acid equivalents) than that(15.33 and 14.83 mg/g) of methanol and water extracts, respectively [83].9.5.4. Anti-Lipoxygenases ActivityLipoxygenases enzymes are known to catalyze oxidation of polyunsaturated fattyacids (linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acid) yielding hydroperoxides. Such reactionsmay be favorable, but also lipoxygenases may interact undesirably. Aromatic compoundsare major yields of lipoxygenase reactions that can interfere with food properties, mainlyduring long-term storage. Lipoxygenase’s impact on unsaturated fatty acids may leadto off-flavor/off-odor formation, leading to food spoilage. Furthermore, lipoxygenase isconsidered as an important enzyme in stimulation of inflammatory reactions in the humanbody by playing as a key factor in the biosynthesis of many bio-regulatory compounds suchas hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), leukotrienes, lipoxins, and hepoxylines that werelinked to major diseases such as cancer, stroke, and heart and brain diseases [88]. Therefore,searching for natural products that could target this enzyme has become a continuous scien-tific mission to prevent such diseases. The onosmins A (2-[(4-methylbenzyl)amino]benzoicacid and B (methyl 2-[(4-methylbenzyl)amino]benzoate) compounds isolated from then-hexane-soluble fraction of ethanol extracts of O. hispida whole plant showed significantlipoxygenase inhibitory activity (IC50: 24.0 and 36.2 µM) [54].10. Other Biological Activity10.1. Parasiticidal ActivityThe antileishmanial activities of the crude methanol extract of O. griffithii and its frac-tions were statistically significant (p < 0.05) against the Leishmania promastigotes, Pakistaniisolates in comparison with the standard drug called Pentamidine [17].10.2. Anti-Inflammatory and Analgesic ActivityThe chloroform extracts from roots of O. aucheranum, O. isauricum, and O. tauricumshowed 28.0%, 34.3%, and 15.6% inhibitory action in p-benzoquinone-induced abdom-inal constriction experiment, while the ethanol extracts of O. isauricum and O. sericeumdemonstrated inhibition action of 24.6% and 27.5%, respectively, in the same test. Thechloroform and ethanol extracts of O. isauricum and ethanol extract of O. sericeum alsoshowed significant inhibitory activity, ranging between 12.3–27.3%, 10.5–25.3%, 8.2–22.6%,respectively, in a carrageenan-induced hind paw edema model at 100 mg/kg dose withoutgastric damage, and the activity was very comparable to indomethacin (32.0–38.4% inhibi-tion) as a standard sample [73]. The chloroform extracts of O. aucheranum and O. isauricumand ethanolic extracts of O. isauricum and O. sericeum exhibited notable antinociceptiveactivity; 28.0%, 34.3%, 24.6%, and 27.5% inhibition, respectively, against p-benzoquinone-induced abdominal contractions, without induction of any sign of gastric lesion [73]. Themethanol extraction of aerial parts of O. bracteatum showed potent analgesic activity byinducing significant increase in the latency period in a dose-dependent manner at differentdoses at 1, 2, and 3 h (with superiority of 500 mg/kg i.e., 258.9% (p < 0.05) at 3 h) postfeeding, respectively, in a tail flick test. Furthermore, the methanol extract of O. bracteatumshowed significant analgesic effect at 500 mg/kg body weight dose by inducing 54% inhibi-Molecules 2022, 27, 8687 22 of 26tion (p < 0.05) in comparison to 45.9% inhibition activity for standard Diclofenac sodium(5 mg/kg body weight) [89].10.3.

Treatment and Prevention of COVID-19The Onosma phytochemicals, deoxyshikonin, 3-hydroxy-isovaleryl shikonin, propionylshikonin, and acetyl shikonin showed significant binding affinities for the Mpro enzymebased on the molecular docking studies using two distinct approaches, in which a SiteMapmodule of Maestro was used to detect the possible ligand binding sites for the Mproenzyme. Docking simulations and molecular mechanics suggest that shikonin derivativesmight be effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds [19].11. ConclusionsApplication of natural products and their metabolites as chemically diverse startingbuilding blocks has been a major driving force in drug discovery over the last century.However, the use of natural products is not linked only to the modern era, as most folkloricmedicines have plant-derived extracts. Moreover, the technological advancement and newtechnical development for isolation and identification of the natural bioactive compounds inherbs have motivated scientists to investigate and use them as nutrients and nutraceuticals,as well as curatives.The genus Onosma, known to be widespread worldwide, has a history of medici-nal uses against different diseases in the folk medicine system of several civilizations.In this review, the authors rediscover the genus Onosma by detailing the important iso-lated and identified chemical compounds and extracts, including naphthoquinone (33),flavonoids (30), hydrocarbon (23), phenolic (22), ester (17), alkaloids (20), terpenoids (10),carboxylic acid (11), fatty acids (9), aromatics (12), and liganin (5). The Onosma phyto-constituents that are considered as potential leads amenable for drug development werereported as rosmarinic acid, apigenin, ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid,caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid.Several biological activities were reported from Onosma compounds and extracts, includ-ing, Genotoxicity and Mutagenicity, antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, antidia-betic, anti-Alzheimer, anti-tyrosinase, anti-lipoxygenases, parasiticidal, anti-inflammatory,and gastric-ulcerogenic activities. Finally, despite the fact that rosmarinic acid is reported asthe most detectable compound in the Onosma species, it was not found in other species suchas O. echioides, O. hookeri, O. heterophylla, and O. erecta, requiring further investigation for moreconfirmation by profiling many other species for comparison.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.J.; methodology, A.A.J. and F.O.A.; software, K.F.A.;validation, Y.G., R.R.H. and A.O.H.; formal analysis, A.A.J. and F.O.A.; writing—original draftpreparation, A.A.J.; writing—review and editing, E.Q.R. and M.I.S.; review and editing.
