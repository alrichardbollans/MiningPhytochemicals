IntroductionFruits vinegar (FsV) is a popular natural product with multiple use purposes. It isremarkably appreciated and included in many people’s daily diet [1–3]. Fruits fermenta-tion produces a bio liquid that contains several functional molecules [4,5] such as organicacids [5,6], polyphenols [7,8], melanoidins [9,10], and tetramethylpyrazine [11,12]. The pro-duction technique used has an impact on the quality of vinegar, while the vinegar-makingprocess plays an important role in the removal and/or formation of new components.The traditional technique promotes the development of aroma and flavor due to the slowprocess of production [4,13,14].Polyphenols and organic acids, mainly acetic acid, plays an important role in thebeneficial properties provided by fruits vinegar [15]. Previously, it is shown that theadministration of apple vinegar curbs the installation of hyperglycemia and hyperlipi-demia induced by hypercaloric fed enriched in D-glucose in male and female rats [16].Clinical studies demonstrated that apple vinegar regulates gene expression via the Mitogrn-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway [17–19], and control blood glucose and lipidslevels [19]. Interestingly, it contains a wide range of functional substances that exert theireffects in synergy [3,20,21]. This review aimed to itemize the chemical composition of FsVand its therapeutics application scientifically proved.Molecules 2022, 27, 222. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27010222 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/moleculesMolecules 2022, 27, 222 2 of 162. MethodologyAll references used in the current review were collected via search engines includingGoogle Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Pub-Med using the followingkeywords: Fruits vinegar, Beneficial properties and vinegar, effects of fruits vinegar. Thearticles (203 articles) were evaluated for relevance and their scientific importance, and119 articles were used to prepare the present review. Other articles were excluded for thepurpose treated that they didn’t fall in the scope of the present review.3. Quality CharacteristicsFsV quality depends on the procedure conditions and raw matter. Vinegar-makingprocess techniques influence the organoleptic properties of final vinegar [4]. The qualitycharacteristics of local products determination are very important to promote vinegarmarketing. It is named as natural means; it is completely safe and healthy [3,22]. The qualityanalysis provides the composition of each product in wanted and unwanted ingredientsthat can potentially be toxic. The quality evaluation requires a panel of analysis includingdetermination of components content and sensory analysis. The acidity is considered a keyfactor to determine the vinegar quality and its content is at least 5 or 6 degrees [23–25]. Thealcohol content is set to the maximum at 0.5 degrees for fruits vinegar and 1% for alcoholvinegar [23,25]. The same values are required by the Codex Alimentarius Norm 79/19 [26].The physicochemical properties of FsV in terms of pH, acidity, electrical conductivity,and ◦Brix values are summarized in Table 1. The pH of fruits vinegar ranged from 2.40 to3.90 [27–30]. Electrical conductivity (EC) is an important parameter to evaluate the abilityof vinegar to allow the passage of electrical current and its relation with the mineral contentof the sample. The values of EC depend on the raw matter used to produce vinegar [27,30].The acidity is an important criterion to examine the quality of vinegar. High values ofacidity observed in apple vinegar made in Turkey may be caused by the hyperoxygenationthat occurs during the second step of the production of vinegar [29]. The second criterionused to determine vinegar quality is the ethanol content, the values reported for differentvinegars range from 0.01 to 2.53 degrees. High values of ethanol content were observed indate vinegar from Iraq [31].Table 1.

Chemical Characteristics of FsVFsV has been the subject of numerous research studies during the last decades. Re-cently, studies are being carried out to determine and identify the phenolic composition ofvinegar (Table 2). The nature and quantity of bioactive compounds present in vinegar areclosely linked to the raw matter used to produce vinegar, the technique selected to producevinegar, and the nature of microorganisms involved in the fermentation process [9,38,39].The active molecules naturally present or new generated not only confer organolepticproperties such as astringency, taste, and color parameters [40,41]. Bioactive ingredients ofvinegar play also an important role in the prevention and treatment of different humanailments [3,9,22,42].FsV is considered a useful product in traditional medicine for the management ofdifferent illnesses such as diabetes [3,16,22]. As previously described, FsV is an excellentsource of multiple bioactive ingredients such as phenolic acids, minerals, organic acids,and tetramethylpyrazine [9,11,29,43]. Phytochemicals present in FsV have numerouspharmacological properties including antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, antimicrobial, andanticancer [4,9,44].Table 2.

Organic AcidsMultiple organic acids were found in FsV including volatile organic acid (acetic acid,formic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and quinic acid) and non-volatile organic acids(lactic acid, malic acid, pyroglutamic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid) (Table 3) [29]. Asa food-grade product, vinegar’s quality depends on its various characteristics, includingaroma, which is the most important quality criterion [55]. Aroma is related to the presenceof organic acids in FsV that are present naturally in raw matter or newly generated duringMolecules 2022, 27, 222 6 of 16the fermentation process. As stated in Table 2, acetic acid is the most abundant acidin vinegar with a proportion of about 92.64–93.22% [29,55], and followed by succinicacid with a percentage of 3.92 to 6.43%, while, oxalic acid and malic acid were presentat lowest quantities [56]. The content of organic acids changed during the productionprocess of vinegar, and it showed the lowest content of organic acids during alcoholicfermentation with a gradual increase which was maintained during the second phase(acetic fermentation) [46]. It proved that these bioactive compounds exhibit several healthbenefits [24,57–62]. Acetic acid as the main organic acid in vinegars is the key factorof numerous beneficial properties through the activation of the MAPK pathway, whichinduces reduction of blood glucose, increases glycogen storage, reduces triglycerides levels,increases insulin sensitivity, and decreases insulin resistance [18]. The aforementionedfeatures revealed that acetic acid is the main acid of vinegar that can ameliorate metabolicdisorders and ameliorate disease markers [16,18,22,63–71].Table 3.

Mineral ContentThe mineral composition of FsV is related to the raw matter. It plays an important roleof human nutrition. Minerals are involved in several physiological functions such as bloodMolecules 2022, 27, 222 7 of 16pressure regulation, muscles contraction, blood cells production, maintaining bones andteeth healthy, sleep modulator, and maintenance of nerve functioning [75–77]. Vinegars arethe potential source of mineral elements including potassium, sodium, calcium, iron, zinc,magnesium, phosphorus, and copper [78,79]. Zhang et al. [80] reported concentrations ofdifferent minerals in wood vinegar as 7.66 ± 0.80 (K), 13 ± 0.78 (Ca), 1.98 ± 0.34 (Mg),3751 ± 60 (Fe), 23.7 ± 0.43 (Mn), and 0.166 ± 0.16 (Zn) mg/kg.

Beneficial Properties of FsVThe double fermentation of fruits furnishes a healthy product that contains an amountof biologically active components. Literature data reported that fruits vinegar consumptionis positively counteracting against numerous diseases [3,32,39,42,62,67,84–86].5.1. Antihyperglycemic EffectThe beneficial antihyperglycemic effects of FsV are partitioned as follows:5.1.1. Animal StudiesInvestigations of the antihyperglycemic activity of FsV were started in the late 80s.In fact, the research conducted by [87] has demonstrated that the co-administration of2% acetic acid with meals (starch intake) decreased significantly glycemia. Subsequently,multiple studies also found that the administration of apple vinegar reduced blood glucoselevels. This effect may be due in part to the stimulation of glucose uptake and enhance-ment of the action of insulin in skeletal muscle [63]. These beneficial effects have beenattributed to acetic acid which acts via MAPK pathway (Figure 1). It is activated througha cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of proteins which induces inhibitionof gene expression [18]. Subsequently, reduction of glucose-6-phosphatase, reduction ofPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and reduction of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1 (SERBP-1) which decrease blood glucose levels, stimulation of glucoseMolecules 2022, 27, 222 8 of 16storage, amelioration of insulin sensitivity, and decreases insulinoresistance (Figure 1) [18].Recently, the administration of apple vinegar at a dose of 2 mL daily by gavage for fiveweeks decreases the risk of developing persistent hyperglycemia induced by a hypercaloricdiet [16]. It was previously reported that the organic acids counteract hydrolyzing enzymesactivities such as sucrase, trehalase, maltase, and lactase [88,89].Molecules 2022, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 18   for five weeks decreases the risk of developing persistent hyperglycemia induced by a hypercaloric diet [16]. It was previously r ported that the organic acids counteract hydro-lyzing enzymes activities such as sucrase, trehalase, maltase, and lactase [88,89].   Figure 1. Mechanism of action possible of apple vinegar on nephro-hepatic functions against hy-drogen peroxide and D-glucose toxicities. 5.1.2. Human Studies  Research conducted on humans was initiated early in ancient Greece medicine, vin-egar is prescribed as a remedy for several ailments [30]. Healthy subjects who consumed vinegar, which contains 1 g of acetic acid, combined with meals enriched with carbohy-drates limited glycemic response due to its acidity without affecting gastric emptying [90]. Furthermore, vinegar consumption reduced the area under the insulin response curve by 20% after ingestion of sucrose, and the glycemic response was reduced by 30% [89]. Ad-ditionally, the ability of vinegar to stimulate glucose uptake by the forearm muscles and blood flow rates were investigated using the arteriovenous difference technique. Authors reported that the administration of vinegar decreases postprandial glycemia and im-proves the insulin action on skeletal muscle, which enhances glucose disposal [63]. Studies focused on the safety and tolerance of vinegar intake reported that vinegar consumption could induce bowel movements and flatulence. On other hand, Johnston et al. reported the hypoglycemic incidence on one of the patients treated with vinegar [22,58]. 5.2. Antihyperlipidemic Effect Vinegar is used in traditional medicine to treat dyslipidemia, which promotes the development of cardiovascular diseases [91]. The administration of apple vinegar during 8 weeks ameliorates lipid profile (cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyc-erides) [91]. Additionally, mice fed with a hyper-fat diet and treated with synthetic acetic acid vinegar or nipa vinegar reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and leptin levels [92]. In another study, the treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with tomato vinegar decreased the triglycerides content by 45.71% as compared to cells untreated with tomato vinegar. It suppressed lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and inhibited adipogenic differentiation, which involves reducing fat accumulation mass and hepatic steatosis [93]. The molecular mechanism involved in the control of body fat by pomegranate vinegar was evoked for the first time by [94] who proved that the pomegranate vinegar activated AMPK in adi-pose tissue. The activation of AMPK inhibits anabolic pathways through suppression of Figure 1. Mechani m of action possible of apple vinegar on nephro-hepatic functi s against hydro-gen peroxide and D-glucose toxicities.5.1.2.

In another study, the treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with tomato vinegar decreasedthe triglycerides content by 45.71% as compared to cells untreated with tomato vinegar.It suppressed lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and inhibited adipogenic differentiation,which involves reducing fat accumulation mass and hepatic steatosis [93]. The molecularmechanism involved in the control of body fat by pomegranate vinegar was evoked for thefirst time by [94] who proved that the pomegranate vinegar activated AMPK in adiposetissue. The activation of AMPK inhibits anabolic pathways through suppression of SERBP-1c (Figure 1) [18,19,94]. Acetic acid is the main component present in vinegar. It has beenshown that the acetic acid downregulates the expression of lipogenic genes through theactivation of AMPK, subsequently inducing diminution of fatty acid synthase and Acetyl-CoA carboxylase levels [95,96]. The interaction of the phytochemical content of vinegarcould be an excellent AMPK activator that may control lipids metabolism (Figure 1).5.3. Antimicrobial EffectBacterial resistance poses major health threats around the world on inconceivablescales. Vinegar has been shown to have potent antibacterial activity against resistantbacteria [28,85,97–99]. Recently, Yagnik et al. studied the effect of apple vinegar on the mul-tiplication of two resistant bacterial strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus andEscherichia coli resistant to cefepime and cefepime-enmetazobactam combined). Proteomicanalysis of both bacteria after treatment with apple vinegar shows the absence of key en-zymes for DNA replication, glycolytic and respiratory proteins. Proteins absent after applevinegar treatment for E. coli are 30 s ribosomal proteins, DNA-directed RNA polymerasealpha subunit, elongation factor TU and G OS-E. coli, formate C-acetyltransferase 1 OSE-coli, chaperone protein, 60 kDa chaperone OS E. coli. Concerning S. aureus, proteins notdetected after treatment with apple vinegar are elongation factor TU and phosphoglyceratekinase [99]. Vinegar contains different organic acids that enter through bacterial membraneinciting internal pH decrease, protonation of macromolecules, and destabilization of thecell membrane by liberation of proton H+ (Figure 2) [100–102]. Other studies have shown aremarkable antibacterial potency of vinegar as compared with different detergents againstseveral microorganisms [33,103]. On the other hand, antifungal activity of vinegar was es-tablished against Candida albicans spp. involved in dental stomatitis [104]. The combinationof apple vinegar with the Endovac irrigation system shows promising results in irradiatingEnterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212)[44].Molecules 2022, 26, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 18   SERBP-1c (Figure 1) [18,19,94].

On the other hand, antifungal activity of vinegar was established against Candida albicans spp. involved in dental stomatitis [104]. The combination of apple vinegar with the Endovac irrigation syste  shows promising results in irradiating Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212)[44].   Figure 2. Mechanism of action possible of apple vinegar against pathogenic bacteria. 5.4. Antioxidant Effect The ability to counteract the deleterious effects of free radicals was the main property searched in a natural product. This property gives vinegar an important preventive and therapeutic effects. Various compounds were found in the vinegar viz polyphenols that have an interesting antioxidant potential due to their power to scavenge free radicals, che-late transition metal ions, and reduce oxidants (Figure 1) [7,8]. Furthermore, melanoidins Figure 2. Mechanism of action possible of apple vinegar against pathogenic bacteria.5.4. Antioxidant EffectThe ability to counteract the deleterious effects of free radicals was the main prop-erty searched in a natural product. This property gives vinegar an important preventiveand therapeutic effects.

Furthermore,melanoidins are among the bioactive compounds in vinegar. Due to their negative chargeand macromolecular properties, they have a strong ability to chelate transition metal ionspreventing metal-induced oxidation reactions [105]. In addition, it contains a large systemof conjugated π bonds and abundant reducing ketone structures, which gives it good freeradical scavenging capacity and high reducing power [106]. Likewise, tetramethylpurazinehas an antioxidant effect by stabilizing the levels of reactive oxygen species and increasingthe levels of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase [43]. Theantioxidant properties of fruits vinegar were previously studied. A panel of tests was usedto determine the antioxidant ability of fruits vinegar. The study conducted by [25] revealedthat the pomegranate vinegar exhibited high antioxidant activity as compared to Riojawine vinegar, Young Sherry vinegar, Reserva Sherry vinegar, and Gran Reserva sherryvinegar. Additionally, the authors concluded that the antioxidant activity of pomegranatevinegar decreased during alcoholic fermentation by 17.6% during acetic fermentation. In astudy developed with persimmon vinegar, apple vinegar, polished rice vinegar, and un-polished rice vinegar, researchers compared the antioxidant ability of vinegars and foundthat persimmon vinegar exhibited high superoxide radical-scavenging activity, DPPHradical-scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity, and antioxidant activityagainst lipid peroxidation in tuna homogenates [107]. In vivo studies have shown thatfruits vinegar increased enzymatic antioxidants including superoxide dismutase (SOD)(7 fold), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (4.81 fold), glutathione reductase (GRx) (1.66 fold),and total antioxidant status (TAS) (3.45 fold). Additionally, fruits vinegar proved its abilityto decrease TBARS levels both in serum and liver by 61.20% and 43.83% against hyper fatdiet [32]. In the same line, Halima et al. [88] evoked that oral administration of fruit vinegarreduced malondialdehyde levels and increased enzymatic antioxidants in hyper fat-dietrats. Fruits vinegars can be useful for the attenuation of oxidative stress through enhancingenzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants levels.5.5. Anti-Inflammatory EffectFruit vinegar had multiple uses as a healthy product. It is used against inflammationthanks to its ability to reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines [39,108]. Previously,it proved that the pear vinegar ameliorates histological disorganization induced by dex-tran sodium sulfate (DSS) in an experimental animal model. Research experiments haveproven that pear vinegar has an interesting ability in reducing serum IL-6 and IL-1ß con-centrations [109]. Studies have been suggested vinegar as a potential liquid to overcomeinflammation. In opposite, Ross and Poluhowich proposed that the administration ofapple cider vinegar was ineffective against inflammation induced by injection of Freund’scomplete adjuvant, which induces rheumatoid arthritis [110]. Recently, Beh et al. (2017)reported that the administration of Nipa vinegar inhibited the genes expression of nuclearfactor-kappa B (NF-Kb) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the liver of mice fedhigh-fat-diet, subsequently decreasing nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in live [92]. The con-sumption of apple vinegar inhibits cyclooxygenase-2, which suppresses proinflammatorymarkers expression and leads to diminish cytokines levels [111]. An experiment in vitrorevealed that the co-culture of 3T3-L1 and Raw264.7 cells using the contact method withCudrania tricuspidata fruits vinegar suppressed inflammatory markers expression decreas-ing nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α),interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) [112].5.6. Other EffectsFruits vinegar contains diverse and different amounts of bioactive compounds whichmake it an active product against several diseases. Mounting evidence proved that fer-mented food counteracts several diseases including cancer [113]. Fruits vinegar containsalso microbial components such as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that are generated duringvinegar aging by the destruction of microorganisms by an elevation of acidity [114]. LPSMolecules 2022, 27, 222 11 of 16modulates the host macrophage network to regulate numerous disorders such as diabetes,dyslipidemia, allergy, and cancer [115]. Additionally, it was proven that vinegar enhancesphagocytic activity to ingest resistant microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichiacoli, which could reinforce the immune system to eradicate pathogen microbes and controlthe inflammation process [99]. Mimura et al. [116] investigated whether sugar can vinegarexerts an induction effect of apoptosis in human leukemia cells including HL-60, THP-1,Molt-4, U-937, Jurkat, Raji, and K-562. The finding led to the conclusion that sugar canvinegar contains lipophilic components with the ability to induce apoptosis in leukemiahuman cells. Study conducted by Seki et al. [117] revealed that the incorporation of vinegarin mice diet at a dose of 0.5% during 72 days decreased significantly tumor sizes andprolonged the life spans of mice implemented with sarcoma 180 and colon 38 tumor cells.Oxidative stress plays an important role in the installation of cancer through modificationsof DNA. Furthermore, fruits vinegar exerts a good antioxidant ability as described abovethat could explain its antioxidative effect thereby protecting cells against reactive oxygenspecies damages.Fruits vinegar consumption furnishes tremendous beneficial properties. It has beenproven that vinegar prevents angiotensin-converting enzymes and reduced blood pressurein spontaneously hypertensive rats [95,118]. The mechanism of action was studied byNa et al. [119], who evoked that the vinegar decreased blood pressure through down-regulating AT1R expression through the AMPK/PGC-1/PPARγ pathway in spontaneouslyhypertensive rats at a dose of 7 mL/kg during 8 weeks of treatment. The experimentrevealed that the treatment with vinegar inhibits the expression of angiotensin II receptortype 1 (AT1R) and increases the expression of PPARγ coactivator 1 alpha and PPARγ, whichexplains the antihypertensive effect of fruits vinegar.6. ConclusionsVinegar is a healthy and wealthy product with multiple functional properties includingantidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects. Differenttechniques have unraveled the presence of different bioactive compounds in vinegar whichare related to the raw material used to produce vinegar. Thus, bioactive ingredients arepresent or newly generated during brewing process. The synergetic effect between differentcomponents of vinegar provides several properties as mentioned above.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, D.O. and I.E.A.; methodology, D.O. and H.L.; validation,B.L.; writing—original draft preparation, D.O. and H.M.; writing—review and editing, M.B. andA.E.G.; Data curation C.H. and R.C.; supervision, B.L. and I.E.A.
