LJMU Research OnlineWorld J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020408Review ArticleIntroductIonMore than 20,000 kinds of plants are used in traditional medicines worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is famous	for	its	unique	curative	effects.	Xanthii Fructus (XF), or “cangerzi” in Chinese, is widely studied as a traditional Chinese medicinal agent. XF is the dried fruit of the composite plant Xanthium sibiricum Patr. With involucre as shown in Figure 1. The fruit ripens in autumn, is harvested and dried, and the impurities such as stems and leaves are removed. XF	was	 first	 described	 in	 Shennong’s	Classic of Materia Medica (during the Qin and Han Dynasties) and was later recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica (Ming Dynasty). XF is often used to treat rhinitis, headache due to a cold, limb cramps and numbness, ulcers, and itching.[1] Modern pharmacological research has shown that XF also exerts	 hypoglycemic,	 anti‑inflammatory,	 and	 other	 effects.[2-4]	Although	XF	 has	 high	 efficacy,	 its	 toxicity	 cannot	 be	ignored. Cases of poisoning induced by accidental ingestion of XF are often reported, mainly resulting from drug-induced liver	injury.[5] This toxicity limits the clinical use of XF. To reduce	the	toxicity	of	XF	and	improve	its	therapeutic	effects,	processed, especially stir-fried, products are often used in China.In recent years, there have been many reports on XF. The main chemical constituents of XF are sesquiterpenoid lactone, glycoside,	 and	 phenolic	 acid;	 it	 also	 contains	 unsaturated	fatty acids and other substances.[6-11] In the 2015 edition of The Fruits of Xanthium sibiricum Patr: A Review on Phytochemistry, Pharmacological Activities, and ToxicityHai Jianga, Xue‑jiao Wanga, Liu Yanga, Jia‑Xu Zhanga, A‑Jiao Houa, Wen‑Jing Mana, Song Wanga, Bing‑You Yanga, Kelvin Chanc, Qiu‑Hong Wanga,b*, Hai‑Xue Kuanga*aKey Laboratory of Chinese Materia Medica, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Education, Harbin, 150040, PR China, bSchool of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, 528458, PR China, CCollege of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, NSW, AustraliaIn	recent	years,	drug	development	and	research	have	gradually	shifted	from	chemical	synthesis	to	biopharmaceutical	and	natural	drugs.	Natural	medicines,	such	as	traditional	Chinese	medicine,	have	been	among	the	first	studied	because	of	their	long	medicinal	history,	simplicity,	and	the	relatively low cost of research. Among them, Xanthii Fructus (XF) is famous for the treatment of sinusitis.

However,	its	mechanism	of action in the treatment of allergic diseases has not been satisfactorily explained. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to rationally develop new drugs and to elucidate the therapeutic potential of XF. A comprehensive evaluation of XF and an understanding of network pharmacology are also needed.Keywords: Pharmacological activities, phytochemistry, toxicity, Xanthii FructusAddress for correspondence: Prof. Qiu‑Hong Wang, Key Laboratory of Chinese Materia Medica, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Education, Harbin, 150040, PR China.School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, 528458, PR China.

A review of Xanthii FructusWorld J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020 409Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China (ChP), carboxyl atractyloside was used as an index to evaluate the toxicity of XF, while chlorogenic acid content was used to evaluate	 quality.	 Some	methods,	 such	 as	 high‑performance	liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry	(GC‑MS),	can	provide	a	reference	for	optimizing	quality and safety controls of XF.[12,13]This article systematically reviews recent studies on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of XF. The purpose was to study XF in depth in order to elucidate its application and pharmacological activity and to discuss the limitations of current studies. Future research directions for XF	are	considered	in	order	to	provide	a	scientific	basis	for	the	development of new drugs and to elucidate its full therapeutic potential.phytocheMIstryXF contains an abundance of chemical constituents. Increasing research activity has enhanced our understanding of its chemical constituents. Thus far, chemical constituents including phenolic acid, sesquiterpenes, glycosides, thiazine, and lignans have been discoveredPhenylpropanoidsPhenylpropanoids are important chemical components in XF, and phenolic acids are the most common phenylpropanoids. There are many phenolic acid compounds, and chlorogenic acid is the most abundant organic acid in XF. Phenolic acid plays	 an	 important	 role	 in	 the	 clinical	 effects	 of	XF.	 It	 has	favorable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, enzyme inhibitory, liver cell protective, and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities, as well as other biological activities.[14-20] In addition to chlorogenic acid, other phenolic acids exist in XF, such as neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid,	caffeic	acid	(1),	ferulic	acid	(2),	isochlorogenic	acid	(3),	protocatechuic	acid	 (4),	and	caffeoylquinic	acids.[21-25] Other studies have shown that the phenolic acid content in these medicinal materials is related to factors such as origin, harvest time, processing time, and temperature.[22] The names and chemical structures of other phenylpropanoids are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2.GlycosideGlycosides are widely distributed in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits of plants.[40] They are mostly colored crystals that dissolve in water.[41] They are generally bitter and	some	are	highly	toxic.	Sugars	and	other	substances	are	formed by hydrolysis.[41] The toxic components of XF are mainly water-soluble glycosides.[34] Jiang (2017) isolated and	 identified	 the	 toxic	 parts	 based	 on	 their	 selection	 by	pharmacological screening. Experiments have shown that the toxic components of XF are carboxyatractyloside (1), atractyloside (2), and 3’,4’-dedisulfated-atractyloside (3).[35-37] After stir-frying, the content of atractyloside decreases, and the toxicity of XF decreases.[36] The glycosides in XF include hemiterpene glycosides, monoterpene glycosides, and diterpenoid glycosides. Details of the glycoside compounds are shown in Table 2. The corresponding chemical structures are shown in Figure 3.SesquiterpenoidThe characteristic components of Compositae are sesquiterpenoid lactones.[45,46] More than 300 sesquiterpenoid lactones have been isolated from Compositae alone. These compounds	 have	 anti‑inflammatory,	 analgesia,	 antitumor,	anti-allergic, antibacterial, antiulcer, and other activities, and they	 affect	 the	 central	 nervous	 system	 and	 cardiovascular	system.[47-54] Most of the sesquiterpene lactones in XF have been extracted with petroleum ether, methanol, ethanol, chloroform, acetone, and other organic solvents. These organic solvents have been further extracted, removed, and extracted by column chromatography to obtain sesquiterpene lactones.[55] To date, approximately forty sesquiterpene lactones	have	been	identified	in	XF	[Table 3]. The detailed chemical structure is shown in Figure 4. Xanthatin is the main active	substance	of	XF,	which	exerts	antitumor	effects.[54]LignanoidsTwenty	lignans	have	been	identified	in	XF	since	2017.	As	shown	in	Figure	5.	They	include	xanthiumnolic	B	(1),	leptolepisol	D (2), fructusol A (3), (-)-1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-{2-methoxy-4-[1-(E)-propen-3-ol] phenoxyl}-propane-3-ol (4), and dihydrode‑hydrodiconiferyl	alcohol	(5);	the	other	components	are shown in Table 4.	Among	them,	in	2017,	xanthiumnolic	B	was	shown	to	have	anti‑inflammatory	effects.[66]ThiazidesTe n  t h i a z i d e  c o m p o u n d s  h a v e  b e e n  r e p o r t e d to	 date:	 xanthiazone	 (1),	 2‑hydroxy‑xanthiazone	 (2),	7-hydroxymethyl-8,8-dimethy l-4,8-dihydrobenzol - [1,4]-thiazine-3,5-dione-11-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (3), 2-hydroxy-7-hydroxymethyl-8,8-dimethyl-4,8 -dihydrobenzol[1,4]thiazine-3,5-dione-11-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (4), 7-hydroxymethyl-8,8-dimethyl-4,8-dihydrobenzol ‑[1,4]‑thiazine‑3,5‑dione‑(2‑O‑caffeoyl)‑β-D-glucopyranoside (5), xanthialdehyde (6), chrysophanic acid (7), emodin (8), aloe emodin (9), and 7-[(β‑D‑apiofuranosyl‑(1→6)‑β-D-glucopyranosyl) oxymethy]-8,8-dimethyl-4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,4]thiazine-3,5-dione (10). The detailed chemical structures are shown in Table 5 and Figure 6.OthersAhuja	and	Nigam	reported	that	XF	contains	anthraquinones.	In	 addition,	flavonoids,	 alkaloids,	 heterocyclic	 compounds,	adenosine, sterols, fatty acids, coumarins, and other compounds have	been	identified	in	XF.[31,71,72]analytIcal MethodsPresently, in ChP, the quality of XF is controlled by HPLC and	the	content	of	chlorogenic	acid	is	at	least	0.25%.	Among	the abovementioned analytical methods, HPLC is the most frequently used, and is the main method used for the analysis of other compounds.[12] Although HPLC is a simple and [Downloaded free from http://www.wjtcm.net on Monday, March 15, 2021, IP: 10.232.74.26]World J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020410Jiang, et al. A review of Xanthii Fructusaccurate method, it does not provide a comprehensive method for the quality control of drugs. Detection of chlorogenic acid content only when determining the content of XF is also a disadvantage because the content of other chemical components in XF has not been determined, which is not favorable for quality control.Recently, with the development of analytical instruments, there have been many reports on the quality control methods for XF. For phenolic acids and glycosides, commonly used analytical methods include HPLC, h i g h - p e r f o r m a n c e  c a p i l l a r y  e l e c t r o p h o r e s i s , ultra‑performance	 liquid	 chromatography	 (UPLC),	ultra-HPLC-triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass s p e c t r om e t r y 	 ( U PLC ‑QTRAP ‑MS /MS ) , 	 a n d	HPLC-photodiode array.  For anthraquinones and flavonoids	 in	XF,	UPLC‑QTRAP‑MS/MS	 is	 an	 effective	method for the simultaneous determination of these two compounds.[73,74] Volatile oils can be detected by HPLC‑evaporative	 light‑scattering	 detector	 and	GC‑MS.	Other methods, such as liquid chromatography-diode array spectrometry/electrospray ionizat ion mass spectrometry	 (HPLC‑DAD/ESI‑MS)	 and	UPLC	 coupled	with	time‑of‑fight	mass	spectrometry	(UPLC/Q‑TOF‑MS),	have also been used to determine the chemical content of Table 1: Phenylpropenoids reported from Xanthii FructusCompound name Part of plant Reference(1S,2R)‑1,2‑bis	(4‑hydroxy‑3‑methoxypenyl‑1,3‑propanediol Fruits [26]1,3,5‑tri‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [27]1,3‑di‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [28]1,4‑di‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [29]1,5‑di‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [22]2,3-dihydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propan-1-one Fruits [30]3,4‑di‑caffeoylquinic	acid	methyl	ester Fruits [31]3,5‑di‑caffeoylquinic	acid	methyl	ester Fruits [31]3,5‑di‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [27]3-hydoxy-1-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propan-1-one Fruits [32]3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-transcinnamaldehyde Fruits [24]4,5‑di‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [29]4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde Fruits [31]4‑O‑caffeoyl	quinic	acid	methyl	ester Fruits [33]5‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [28]Arbutin Fruits [34]Caffeic	acid Fruits [22]Caffeic	acid	choline	ester Fruits [33]Caffeic	acid	ethyl	ester Fruits [24]Chlorogenic acid Fruits [28]Coniferine Fruits [35]Erythro-guaiacylglycerol-8-O-4’-(coniferyl alcohol) ether Fruits [36]Erythro‑guaiacylglycerol‑β‑coniferyl	aldehyde	ether Fruits [26]Ferulic acid Fruits [26]Icariside D1 Fruits [37]Icariside F2 Fruits [32]Isovanillic acid Whole plants [37]Methyl‑3,5‑di‑O‑caffeoylquinic	acid Fruits [29]Methylchlorogenate Fruits [38]Neochlorogenic	acid	methyl	ester Fruits [28]p-hydroxybenzaldehyde Fruits [39]Protocatechuic acid Fruits [24]rel‑(2α,3β)‑7‑O‑methylcedrusin Fruits [40]Threo-1-phenyl-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy)-2-phenyl-(4”-hydroxy-3”-methoxy)-1,3-propanediol Fruits [38]Threo-guaiacylglycerol-8-O-4’- (coniferyl alcohol) ether Fruits [26]Threo‑guaiacylglycerol‑β‑coniferyl	aldehyde	ether Fruits [26]Xanthiumnolic A Fruits [39]Xanthiumnolic C Fruits [39]Xanthiumnolic D Fruits [39]Xanthiumnolic E Fruits [39]ω‑hydroxypropioguaiacone Fruits [32][Downloaded free from http://www.wjtcm.net on Monday, March 15, 2021, IP: 10.232.74.26]Jiang, et al.

In recent years, researchers have studied the relationship between pharmacological activity and the content of chemical constituents in plants. This analytical method may bring about a great change in the quality control of XF.pharMacologIcal actIvItIes and clInIcal applIcatIonPharmacological activitiesThe earliest application of Xanthium in China can be traced back	 to	 the	Qin	dynasty.	The	 roots,	 stems,	 leaves,	flowers,	and fruits of Xanthium have been reported to have medicinal effects	in	classical	works,	including	XF.[74]Antimicrobial activityIn vitro,	XF	has	been	shown	to	exert	a	strong	inhibitory	effect	on many microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococcus, and Group b Streptococcus.[75,76] It has demonstrated	clear	bacteriostatic	effects	on	Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis,	whereby	 the	 bacteriostatic	 effect	 on E. coli is greater than that on B. subtilis.[77]Acetone and ethanol extracts of XF have also demonstrated inhibitory	effects	on	Trichoderma rubra. Chloroform extract and n-butanol extract of XF can inhibit Demodex oculi, and mucous toxicity tests found no irritation.[78] The inhibition rate of	hepatitis	B	virus	(HBV)	DNA	by	XF	polysaccharides	was	25%–50%.[63] XF extracts can control the pathological changes caused	by	HBV	without	affecting	transaminase	levels.[79] In addition, an ethanol extract of XF can completely inhibit the growth	of	herpes	virus	at	0.1	mg/mL,	and	has	no	toxic	effect	on normal cells.[80]Anti‑inflammatory and analgesic activitiesIntraperitoneal	injection	of	methanol	extract	of	XF	at	250	mg/kg	increased	analgesia	by	30%–60%.	XF	has	some	anti‑inflammatory	and analgesic effects on writhing reaction induced by subcutaneous	injection	of	1000	mg/kg	acetic	acid	in	mice.[64,81] The	anti‑inflammatory	mechanism	of	action	has	been	discussed	in	recent	years.	Studies	have	shown	that	the	product	of	the	MEXS	gene is a potent inhibitor of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and tumor	necrosis	factor‑alpha	(TNF‑α) production. Inducible nitric oxide	synthase,	cyclooxygenase‑2	expression,	and	TNF‑α release were	inhibited	through	the	blockade	of	nuclear	factor‑kappa	B	activation	by	MEXS.	XF	has	an	inhibitory	effect	on	the	above	inflammatory	factors	to	a	certain	extent.[8,82]Anti‑allergy effectAmong	 the	 various	 extracts	 of	XF,	 a	 70%	alcohol	 extract	was found to have the best anti-allergic effect, and its anti-allergy mechanism may be related to the inhibition of Ca2+	influx	in	mast	cells	and	the	intracellular	cyclic	adenosine	monophosphate (cAMP) content.[83-85] Dai et al. (in 2008) showed that xanthium can inhibit allergic reactions rapidly. Accordingly,	70%	alcohol	extracts	of	XF	inhibit	anaphylactic	shock in mice, passive skin reactions in rats in vivo, and reduce histamine and beta-aminohexase release by rat mast cells in vitro.	It	was	found	to	have	no	significant	effect	on	the	skin	Table 2: Glycosides reported from Xanthii FructusCompound name Part of plant ReferenceHemiterpene glycoside2‑methyl‑3‑buten‑2‑ol‑β‑D‑apiofuranosyl‑(1→6)‑β‑D‑glucopyranoside Fruits [42]everlastoside C Fruits [43]Monoterpene glycoside(6E)‑3‑hydroxymethyl‑7‑methylocta‑1,6‑dien‑3‑ol8‑O‑β‑D‑glucop	yranoside Fruits [7](6Z)‑3‑hydroxymethyl‑7‑methylocta‑1,6‑dien‑3‑ol8‑O‑β‑D‑glucopyranoside Fruits [7]3β‑norpinan‑2‑one	3‑O‑β‑D‑apiofuranosyl‑(1→6)‑β‑D‑glucopyranoside Fruits [7]xanmonoter A Fruits [44]xanmonoter	B Fruits [44]Diterpenoid glycoside3’,4’-dedisulphated-atractyloside Fruits [40]atractyloside Fruits [36]carboxyatractyloside Fruits [38]Fructusnoid A Fruits [44]Fructusnoid	B Fruits [44]Fructusnoid C Fruits [44]Figure 1: The plant Xanthium sibiricum Patr. and Xanthii Fructus[Downloaded free from http://www.wjtcm.net on Monday, March 15, 2021, IP: 10.232.74.26]World J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020412Jiang, et al. A review of Xanthii Fructusresponse to histamine or serotonin in rats. These results showed that XF can stabilize hypertrophic cell membranes, reduce the release of histamine and other allergic mediators, and inhibit mast cell-dependent anaphylaxis.[82,83]Antioxidant effectFree	radicals	have	a	great	 influence	on	oxidation	reactions.	Extracts of XF have been shown to scavenge superoxide radicals	 and	hydroxyl	 radicals;	 they	have	 also	been	 shown	to delay and reduce lipid peroxidation.[54] In addition, XF extracts can reduce the lipid peroxide content in tissues and increase the activity of superoxide dismutase. The antioxidant activity of an XF extract was better at scavenging superoxide free radicals, while that of an alcohol extract was better at scavenging hydroxyl free radicals.[86]Antitumor effectUsing	 a	 serum	 pharmacology	method,	Wei	 et al. treated human liver cancer cells cultured in vitro with low, medium, and	high	doses	of	XF	in	mouse	serum	and	5‑fluorouracil,	and	used	clonogenesis	and	flow	cytometry	to	examine	the	effects	on cell division, proliferation, and apoptosis.[87,88] The results showed that the XF drug serum had inhibitory and toxic effects	on	human	liver	cancer	cells.	In	addition	to	its	effects	on human liver cancer cells, XF drug serum displayed clear toxic	and	inhibitory	effects	on	human	brain	glioma	and	S180	sarcoma cells.[4]Hypoglycemic effectMonosaccharides are absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the small intestine, whereas disaccharides and Table 3: Sesquiterpenoids reported from Xanthii FructusCompound name Part of plant Reference(2E,4E,1’S,2’R,4’S,6’R)‑dihydrophaseic	acid Fruits [24](3S,5R,6R,7E,9S)‑megastigman‑7ene‑3,5,6,9‑tetrol‑3‑O‑β‑D‑glucopyranoside Aerial parts [56](3S,5R,6S,7E)‑5,6‑epoxy‑3‑hydroxy‑7‑megastigmene‑9‑one Fruits [24]11α,13‑dihydro‑8‑epi‑xanthatin Aerial parts [57]11α,13‑dihydroxanthatin Aerial parts [58]11α,13‑dihydroxanthuminol Leaves [59]1β,4β,	4α,5α‑diepoxyxanth‑11(13)‑en‑12‑oic	acid Aerial parts [58]1β,4β,4α,5α‑diepoxyxanth‑11 Fruits [58]1β‑hydroxyl‑5α‑chloro‑8‑epi‑xanthatin Aerial parts [55]2-hydroxy xanthinosin Aerial parts [60]2-hydroxytomentosin Aerial parts [61]2‑hydroxytomentosin‑1β,5β‑epoxide Aerial parts [58]4-epi-isoxanthanol Aerial parts [58]4-epi-xanthanol Aerial parts [58]4-oxo-bedfordia acid Aerial parts [58]4β,5β‑epoxyxanthatin‑1α,4α‑endoperoxide Aerial parts [58]5-azuleneacetic acid Aerial parts [60]6β,9β‑dihydroxy‑8‑epi‑xanthatin Fruits [63]8-epi-tomentosin Leaves [57]8-epi-xanthatin Aerial parts [62]Desacetylxanthanol Leaves [65]Dihydrophaseic	acid	sodium	salt	4’‑O‑β‑D‑glucopyranoside Fruits [56]Inusoniolide Aerial parts [60]Lasidiol p-methoxybenzoate Fruits [59]Norxanthantolide	A Fruits [45]Norxanthantolide	B Fruits [45]Norxanthantolide	C Fruits [45]Norxanthantolide	D Fruits [45]Norxanthantolide	E Fruits [45]Norxanthantolide	F Fruits [45]Pungiolide A Aerial parts [64]Pungiolide D Aerial parts [64]Pungiolide E Aerial parts [64]Sibirolide	A Fruits [45]Sibirolide	B Fruits [45]Tomentosin Leaves [53]Xanthatin Leaves [53]Xanthinosin Leaves [53]Xanthnon Aerial parts [60][Downloaded free from http://www.wjtcm.net on Monday, March 15, 2021, IP: 10.232.74.26]Jiang, et al. A review of Xanthii FructusWorld J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020 413polysaccharides are converted into monosaccharides by alpha-glucose liver enzymes.[89] XF can reduce liver glycogen in animals, and a water extract of XF can inhibit the activity of alpha-glucose liver enzymes. The glycosides in XF can significantly reduce the blood glucose level induced by rhamnose, but cannot reduce the hyperglycemia caused by tetrafluorouracil	in	rats.	If	rhamnose	is	injected	first,	followed	by epinephrine, the elevated blood sugar response of epinephrine decreases or is lost. Low, medium, and high doses of an XF decoction can reduce the blood glucose of normal mice, and are able to regulate blood glucose and maintain blood glucose stability. The medium- and high-dose XF decoctions can significantly	reduce	the	blood	glucose	of	hyperglycemia	mice	and improve the glucose tolerance of hyperglycemia mice.[66,90,91]Effects on immune functionAnimal experiments have shown that XF has an inhibitory effect	on	both	humoral	and	cellular	immunity,	with	a	greater	effect	 on	 cellular	 immunity.	 In	 addition,	XF	 displayed	 an	inhibitory	 effect	 on	 the	 immune	 response	 of	mononuclear	macrophages.[92] XF is not conducive to the increase in capillary	permeability	caused	by	histamine.	XF	significantly	inhibits the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor, regulates the immune imbalance of Th cells in patients with asthma, and inhibits the release of inflammatory transmitters.[56] Experiments	have	shown	 that	XF	 induces	different	degrees	of	weight	gain	in	immune	organs.	Specifically,	the	weight	of	the thymus and spleen increased with an increasing dose, and the serum hemolysin value increased in mice.[93]Effects on other physiological systemsIn vitro animal experiments have shown that XF has an inhibitory	effect	on	the	heart,	and	can	slow	the	heart	rate	and	reduce myocardial systolic function. Animal models have revealed	different	effects	of	XF	on	blood	vessels,	which	mainly	functions to dilate blood vessels.[94] In addition, XF extracts exerted	an	obvious	antithrombin	effect.

A review of Xanthii FructusWorld J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020 415Clinical applicationXF is used to clinically treat rhinitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory infection, hypoglycemia, intractable toothache, malaria, chronic bronchitis, mumps, allergic diseases, urticaria, tumor, dermatitis, diarrhea, and otitis media.[90-98]toxIcIty and sIde effectsThe symptoms of XF poisoning are generally the same, regardless of the drug administration route. The activity of laboratory animals decreased upon XF administration.[95] Compared to normal animals, experimental animals were less active and responsive to external stimuli and had irregular breathing	and	extreme	breathing	difficulties	with	paroxysmal	convulsion before they died.[96] The absolute lethal dose (LD100) of	a	25%	XF	emulsion	intraperitoneally	injected	into	rabbits	was 10 mL/kg, and the median lethal dose (LD50) in mice was 7.5 mL/kg.[97] Histopathological examination of the main organs of various animals after poisoning revealed the same lesions,	differing	only	in	the	degree	of	severity.	Among	them,	liver	injury	was	the	most	serious.[98] The livers of dead animals presented degenerative disease or even necrosis, and epithelial turbiditis in the curved tube of the kidney was similar to the symptoms of carbon tetrachloride poisoning.[99] Therefore, the main	consequence	of	XF	poisoning	 is	 liver	necrosis;	death	may be due to convulsion caused by secondary brain edema. Many studies have found that the toxic components of XF may be related to toxic proteins or xanthium glycosides and alkaloids.[100] The toxicity of XF extract is proportional to the drug concentration.The toxic components of XF were determined for medicinal xanthium herbs, decoction pieces, and representative formulations	containing	xanthium	(Biyuanshu	oral	liquid).	The	results	showed	that	toxicity	was	observed	as	follows:	decoction	pieces > medicinal material > prescription preparation. The results of acute toxicity tests showed that all the three preparations	in	mice	resulted	in	toxicity	as	follows:	decoction	pieces > medicinal material > prescription preparation. The toxicity of decoction pieces was greater than that of medicinal herbs, which was consistent with the trend observed for atractylode content.[99]Clinical adverse reactions of XF have been reported in clinical studies and mainly manifest in terms of damage to the skin, digestive system, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. The	 specific	 performance	was	 as	 follows:[94,96-101] first, skin lesions	manifest	as	a	systemic	rash	or	contact	dermatitis;	second,	digestive system toxicity is characterized by nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal distention, diarrhea, hematochezia, liver and kidney pain, liver enlargement, ascites, liver coma, abnormal liver	function,	and	liver	failure;	third,	nervous	system	symptoms	include dizziness, headache, restlessness, convulsions, drowsiness, Figure 3: Chemical structure of glycosides reported from Xanthii Fructus[Downloaded free from http://www.wjtcm.net on Monday, March 15, 2021, IP: 10.232.74.26]World J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020416Jiang, et al.

A review of Xanthii FructusBecause	processing	can	reduce	the	toxicity	of	XF,	clinical	use	generally involves processed products of XF.[23] In the Liu and	Song	dynasties	of	the	southern	and	northern	dynasties	of	China, XF was steamed with Polygonatum sibiricum (Thunder Lord). The Tang Dynasty employed a method of burning ashes.	In	the	Song	Dynasty	of	China,	methods	such	as	burning	ashes,	stir‑frying	(Shenghuifang),	stir‑frying	incense	to	stab	(certificate	type),	and	baking	(First	aid)	are	recorded.	In	the	Ming Dynasty of China, stir-fry and steaming were commonly used,	such	as	pastry	(Puji	formula),	micro	stir‑fry	(medicine),	steaming with P. sibiricum	 juice	 (introduction),	 single	steaming (Dafa), stir-fry to remove thorns, and wine mix steaming (Chengya). The Qing Dynasty of China used methods such as stir-frying and smashing (the law), and stir-frying, stir-frying with wine (Materia Medica). Presently, XF processing technology is generally divided into net and frying processes.[99] The cleaning process refers to the removal of cockle thorns and impurities. Common methods for the frying process include the clear frying method and the blanching method.[102] During this process, the blanching method is generally selected.[103-106] The optimal way to prepare XF to reduce its toxicity is to fry it and then grind the spines. For clinical use, it must be fried until brown to reduce toxicity.[107]The chemical composition and pharmacological action of XF also change substantially before and after processing.For phenolic acid, the content of total phenolic acid in XF was significantly	different	with	different	processing	temperatures	and times, and the content ranged from 7.99 to 9.69 mg/g. The contents of new chlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, 1,5‑dicaffeinic	acid,	and	total	phenolic	acid	in	the	decoction	of XF after frying increased with increasing preparation temperature.[108,109]For volatile and fatty oils, the content of fatty oil was significantly	 higher	 than	 that	 of	 crude	oil,	 but	 the	 physical	constant	 changed	 little,	 and	 the	 specific	 gravity	 and	 acid	values decreased slightly upon processing. Woody et al. (2013) qualitatively analyzed the changes in volatile oil and fat oil before	and	after	processing	of	XF	by	GC‑MS.	The	volatile	oil	in	the raw products of XF included 18 chemical constituents, and the volatile oil in the fried products of XF included 13 chemical constituents.	Four	components	of	XF	were	identified	in	raw	and	fried fat oil. The results showed that the chemical composition of	volatile	oil	was	different	before	and	after	processing,	while	the composition of fat oil was not changed.[110]For water-soluble glycosides and mixed protein, Han (2014)  found that the rate of XF seed protein extraction had	significantly	reduced	after	frying.[111] Duorui et al. (2013) found that the content of hydroxy atractylodes decreased to 10%	after	XF	was	fried	to	yellow.	During	the	frying	process,	hydroxy atractylodes were converted to atractylodes, and no carboxyl atractylodes were present after XF was fried to char. Moreover, atractylodes increased at temperatures of 140°C–260°C	and	decreased	at	temperatures	above	260°C.In 2008, Chen Daihong showed that processing could increase the	analgesic	effect	and	reduce	drug	toxicity.[43] In 2012, Wu Hui	compared	differences	in	the	toxicity	of	toxic	parts	before	and after frying by means of an acute toxicity pharmacological test in mice, and showed that the fried products of xanthium have reduced toxicity.[56] Zhao et al. showed that a water decoction	and	fatty	oil	emulsion	of	XF	were	more	effective	than the raw products against S. aureus and Pneumococcus.[112] In	2016,	the	anti‑inflammatory	effects	of	raw	XF	seed	products	were	found	to	exceed	those	of	fried	products,	and	the	effects	of processed drugs on blood glucose lowering were better than those of raw products.[43]	There	was	no	significant	difference	between raw and fried xanthium in terms of blood glucose lowering.[113]XF presents reduced toxicity after stir-frying. Therefore, XF should be used for medicinal purposes after stir-frying, but the temperature should be controlled strictly to prevent the loss	of	efficacy.Figure 6: Chemical structure of thiazides reported from Xanthii Fructus[Downloaded free from http://www.wjtcm.net on Monday, March 15, 2021, IP: 10.232.74.26]Jiang, et al. A review of Xanthii FructusWorld J Tradit Chin Med | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | October-December 2020 419future perspectIves and conclusIonsXF has been used for years in China as a drug to treat sinusitis. To date, national and international scientists have isolated 100 chemical components from XF. The pharmacological activities of its chemical components have mainly focused on phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenoids, while studies on lignanoids and thiazides are relatively rare. In addition, the decreased toxicity of XF before and after processing may be	related	to	changes	in	the	chemical	composition;	however,	experimental evidence to support this is lacking. In this article, the chemical components of XF are summarized, which is expected to be helpful for the research and development of new drugs, especially in terms of its pharmacodynamics and structure–activity	relationship.In terms of pharmacology, XF is often used in the clinical treatment of allergic diseases, suggesting that it may have immunosuppressive	and	anti‑allergy	effects;	however,	there	has been no reasonable explanation to explain its clinical efficacy.	 Network	 pharmacology	 is	 commonly	 used	 to	analyze the mechanism of action of XF, and may represent a suitable method for studies on its mechanism of action. At the same time, researchers should perform further in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate the full therapeutic potential of XF.With the development of natural medicinal chemistry, more attention must be paid to TCM. XF contains abundant medicinal plant resources and is widely distributed in China. In this article, the chemical components, analytical methods, pharmacological effects, clinical application, toxicity, and processing technology of XF are systematically reviewed, and some issues that need to be overcome are discussed, in order to provide a direction for the future study of XF.AcknowledgmentsThis	 project	 was	 financially	 supported	 by	 the	National	Natural	 Science	 Foundation	 of	 China	 (No.	 81703684,	81803690,	and	81973604);	the	Graduate	Innovative	Research	Project	 Foundation	 of	Heilongjiang	University	 of	Chinese	Medicine	 (No.	 2019yjsc	 ×	 013);	 the	 Innovative	Talents	Funding	 of	Heilongjiang	University	 of	Chinese	Medicine	(No.	2018RCD25);	the	National	Natural	Science	Foundation	Matching	Project	(No.	2018PT02);	the	Postdoctoral	Initial	Fund	of	Heilongjiang	Province,	 the	University	Nursing	Program	for	Young	Scholars	with	Creative	Talents	 in	Heilongjiang	Province	(No.	UNPYSCT	2017219	and	UNPYSCT	2017215);	the	National	Natural	Science	Foundation	Matching	Project	(No.	2017PT01);	Heilongjiang	Postdoctoral	 Scientific	Research	Developmental	Fund	(No.	LBH	Q16210	and	LBH‑Q17161);	the	Natural	 Science	Foundation	 of	Heilongjiang	Province	(No.	H2015037);	 the	Heilongjiang	University	 of	Chinese	Medicine	Doctoral	 Innovation	Foundation	 (No.	2014bs05);	and the Application Technology Research and Development Projects	of	Harbin	Technology	Bureau	(No.	2014RFQXJ149).Availability of data and materialsAll reported or analyzed data in this review were extracted from published articles.Financial support and sponsorshipNil.Conflicts of interestThere	are	no	conflicts	of	interest.references1.
