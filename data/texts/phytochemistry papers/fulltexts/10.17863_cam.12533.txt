ContentMine.org	is	a	not-for-profit	UK	company.		We	thank	The	Shu9leworth	FoundaMon	for	a	Fellowship	tp	PMR	and	The	Wikimedia	FoundaMon	for	funding	for	TA	and	CM.	Contact	peter@contentmine.org			ContentMine	and	Wikidata	Wikidata		is	“Wikipedia	for	machines”	and	supports	ContentMine’s	FullContent	search	of	the	Bioscience	literature.	We	go	beyond	keywords	to	automaGcally	generated	structured	dicGonaries	with	thousands	of	terms	and	aliases.	FullContent	means	not	just	words,	but	structured	documents,	tables	and	diagrams.	We	(and	you)	can	search	the	whole	literature	(via	EuropePMC	or	Crossref)	every	day	automaMcally	or	retrospecMvely	for	your	sub-areas	of	interest.		Example:		Find	facts	about	terpenes	emi;ed	by	conifers	in	Indonesia.		We	autogenerate	3	large	dicMonaries	for	all	terpenes,	conifers	and	Indonesian	place/island	names	in	Wikidata.				IntroducGon	Understanding	phytochemical	diversity	and	metabolism	can	answer	many	important	scienMfic	quesMons	and	provide	economically	important	informaMon;	forming	the	foundaMon	for	metabolic	engineering	of	plant	compounds.	Phytochemical	database	resources	exist	but	much	informaMon	on	their	associaMon	with	species,	enzymes	and	places	without	the	standardised	format	and	metadata	required	to	enable	machine	analysis.	In	some	cases	it	is	painstakingly	extracted	manually,	but	this	approach	is	not	scalable.		Semi-automated	extracMon	of	phytochemical	data	across	the	full-text	open	access	literature	is	anMcipated	to	significantly	extend	previous	abstract-only	coverage.	Here	we	present	an	open	source	pipeline	and	preliminary	results	for	terpene	data	mining.	Reusable	WikiFactMine	DicGonaries.We	expand	the	Wikidata	term	terpene	automaMcally	to	~450	items	(such	as	carvone)	giving	>1000	precise	search	terms	and	data.	Similarly	in	a	few	seconds	we	can	generate	dicMonaries	of		conifers	(1899);		and	Indonesian	islands	(6344)	making	broad	queries	precise.	Search	Strategies.	(A)	Daily	search.	All	new	Open	publicaMons	(300-1000)	on	EuropePMC	are	downloaded	to	WikimediaLabs,	indexed	by	dicMonaries,	and	the	extracted	facts	(dicMonary	hits)	stored	in	Zenodo	(CERN’s	Open	repository)	.	Each	paper	may	have	hundreds	or	thousands	of	facts.	(B)	On-Demand.	A	researcher,	especially	those	doing	systemaGc	reviews.		creates	a	fairly	general	query	in	her	field	with	a	range	of	dates,	journals,	etc.	and	downloads	papers	(getpapers	and	quickscrape)	.	The	papers	are	filtered	locally	with	a	much	more	precise	query	(norma/ami).
