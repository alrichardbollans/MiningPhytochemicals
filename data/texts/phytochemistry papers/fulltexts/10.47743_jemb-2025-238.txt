Ethanolic extracts of G. senegalensis leaves were fractionated, and the resulting fractions were analyzed using GC-MS and NMR techniques. Forty compounds were identified by comparing their spectral data with published references. The hexane extract exhibited promising anti-leishmanial activity against Leishmania major, with an IC₅₀ of 16.69 ± 0.3 µg/mL. The ethyl acetate fraction showed moderate activity (IC₅₀ = 89.63 ± 0.6 µg/mL), while dichloromethane fractions were inactive at concentrations exceeding 100 µg/mL. The extract demonstrated limited antibacterial activity, inhibiting only Bacillus subtilis with a 60.31% inhibition rate, and showed no antifungal effects. Cytotoxicity testing on 3T3 cells revealed less than 50% inhibition, indicating minimal toxicity at tested concentrations. These findings support the ethnopharmacological relevance of G. senegalensis and highlight its potential as a source of anti-leishmanial drug candidates. Keywords:  Guiera senegalensis, spectral analysis, Bio-assay, Anti-leishmanial activity. Introduction: Natural products remain a vital source of chemical diversity for drug discovery, with medicinal plants offering a rich repository of bioactive compounds, including crude extracts, essential oils, and secondary metabolites (1). In Africa, many traditionally used medicinal plants remain understudied despite their therapeutic potential. Guiera senegalensis, a shrub belonging to the Combretaceae family, is widely used in traditional African medicine, particularly across the Sahel region. It is employed in treating wounds, snakebites, gastrointestinal disorders, coughs, and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (2). These traditional uses have prompted increasing scientific interest in its phytochemistry and pharmacological properties. Previous studies have reported antioxidant, neuroprotective, and antibacterial effects from the ethanolic leaf extract, attributed to compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and galloylquinic acid derivatives (3). GC-MS analysis has identified over 50 compounds in G. senegalensis, including significant concentrations of flavonoids and alkaloids (4). These phytochemicals are known to exert antibacterial and antifungal activities, primarily through mechanisms like membrane disruption and enzyme inhibition (5). Research Article   Atia et al (2025) J Exp Molec Biol 26(3):x-xx; DOI: 10.47743/jemb-2025-238  www.jemb.bio.uaic.ro Page 2  Given the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the global burden of leishmaniasis, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic agents. This study investigates the phytochemical profile of G. senegalensis leaves and evaluates the biological activities of its extracts and fractions, with a focus on anti-leishmanial, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. We hypothesize that the ethanolic leaf extract contains bioactive phytochemicals such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids that exhibit antimicrobial and antiparasitic effects through mechanisms including membrane disruption, microbial enzyme inhibition, and interference with parasite metabolism. This study aims to isolate and identify these compounds and assess their biological activities to elucidate their potential modes of action. The novelty of this study lies in its integrative approach, combining GC-MS and NMR-based phytochemical profiling with targeted bioactivity screening. Unlike prior studies, our work systematically links specific chemical fractions of G. senegalensis to anti-leishmanial and antimicrobial effects, providing new insights into its pharmacological potential. Materials and Methods:  Plant Collection and Authentication: Guiera senegalensis leaves were collected from Darfur, Western Sudan, and authenticated by a taxonomist at the Herbarium of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and Traditional Medicine Research Institute (MAPTRI), National Centre for Research (NCR), Khartoum, Sudan. A voucher specimen was deposited (Voucher No. KHT-SD-2022/43). Extraction Procedure The plant material was washed, air-dried, ground into powder, and stored at room temperature. One kilogram of powdered leaves was extracted with 80% ethanol using the maceration method described by Harborne (6). The extract was filtered, evaporated under reduced pressure, and the yield was calculated. Residues were stored at 4 °C in tightly sealed glass vials for further analysis. Fractionation, Compound Isolation, and Purification The crude ethanolic extract was partitioned sequentially using solvents of increasing polarity: n-hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), and ethyl acetate (EtOAc), using a separating funnel. Each fraction was concentrated, weighed (n-hexane: 14.29 g; DCM: 32.46 g; EtOAc: 38.14 g), and stored for chromatographic separation. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel and a gradient solvent system (n-hexane–EtOAc–MeOH). Fractions (F1–F24) were collected and further purified by semi-preparative HPLC (RP-C18 column), using MeOH:H₂O (80:20) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min for 20 minutes. Isolated compounds were collected in pre-weighed, labeled vials and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (7). The bio-active compounds were identified by GC-MS, and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral data. GC- MS were conducted using: Gas chromatography- mass spectrum (GC-MS) analysis: Mass-Hunter GC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with a ZEBRON –ZB-5 column (430C: 30 m × 320 µm × 0.25 µm) and operated in electron ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV with a scan MS1 range of 40–700 m/z. Helium was used as the carrier gas (1.5 mL/min). The temperature of the inlet was set to 250 ◦C. The column temperature initiated at 50 ◦C for 5 min, and then was programmed to rise to 200 ◦C at the rate of 7 ◦C/min for 20 mi, then to raise 300 ◦C at the rate 7 ◦C/ min, for 30 min  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral data:  One – dimensional (l1H NMR),  two –dimensional(2D),  and 13C NMR, spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or MeOD on AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Switzerland) at 500 MHz using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The chemical shifts were given in δ (ppm). Their spectral data were then Research Article   Atia et al (2025) J Exp Molec Biol 26(3):x-xx; DOI: 10.47743/jemb-2025-238  www.jemb.bio.uaic.ro Page 3 of 11  compared with published values and further conformed using NIST/EPA/NIH Mass spectral database (NIST11) to NIST MS search program v.2.0 g. (8). Biological Assays: Cell Line and Cytotoxicity screening  The cytotoxicity of the extracts and fractions was evaluated using 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells via the MTT colorimetric assay (9). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with varying concentrations of test samples. After 24 hours, MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 hours. The resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a micro-plate reader (Spectra Max Plus, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Cytotoxicity was expressed as the concentration causing 50% growth inhibition (IC₅₀). Percent inhibition was calculated using the formula: Inhibition (%) = 100 − $𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧	𝐨𝐟	𝐎.𝐃	𝐨𝐟	𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭	𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝	1	𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧	𝐨𝐟	𝐎.𝐃	𝐨𝐟	𝐧𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞	𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧	𝐨𝐟	𝐎.𝐃	𝐨𝐟	𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞	𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥	1	𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧	𝐨𝐟	𝐎.𝐃	𝐨𝐟	𝐧𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞	𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥% × 100 OD test: Mean optical density of cells treated with test compound OD negative: Mean OD of negative control (e.g., untreated cells = 100% viability) OD positive. Mean OD of positive control (e.g., a known cytotoxic agent like doxorubicin = 0% viability). Data were processed using Soft Max Pro Software (Molecular Devices, USA).  Anti-Leishmanial Activity: The anti-leishmanial activity of G. senegalensis extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds was evaluated against Leishmania major promastigotes (ATCC 50155) using a micro-plate-based assay (10). Promastigotes were incubated with test samples in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Parasite viability was assessed by counting motile cells using a Neubauer chamber. IC₅₀ values were calculated using EZ-Fit software based on dose-response curves (11)  Screening of plant extract on Amastigotes:  To evaluate intracellular activity, macrophage monolayers were prepared in 24-well plates (1×10⁶ cells/well) and infected with L. major promastigotes at a ratio of 5:1 (parasite: macrophage). After 48 hours of incubation, non-internalized parasites were removed, and infected macrophages were treated with test extracts. The following parameters were calculated: Infection Rate (IR) =        Number of infected macrophages in 100 macrophages       Multiplication Index (MI):   = Number of amastigotes in test culture / 100 macrophages    x 100                                                        Number of amastigotes in control / 100 macrophages Antibacterial Activity: Preparation of Bacterial Inoculum: Antibacterial activity was tested against five bacterial strains (E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, and S. typhi) using the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA), as described by Sarker. (12). Bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (~10⁸ CFU/mL), and diluted 1:10 in nutrient broth. Microdilution Assay: 100 μL of nutrient broth was dispensed into each well of a sterile 96-well plate. Serial two-fold dilutions of extracts were prepared, followed by 100 μL of bacterial suspension and 10 μL of resazurin dye (0.01% w/v). Ciprofloxacin was used as the positive control. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Color change was visually inspected and quantitatively measured at 570 nm and 600 nm. MIC Determination: The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract or fraction at which no visible color change (i.e., retention of blue color) occurred, indicating effective inhibition of bacterial growth. Percentage Inhibition (%) = '7	89:;<9=17	>=?:@7	89:;<9=17	;AB; ( × 100 Research Article   Atia et al (2025) J Exp Molec Biol 26(3):x-xx; DOI: 10.47743/jemb-2025-238  www.jemb.bio.uaic.ro Page 4  In-vitro Anti-fungal activity Bioassay (Preliminary Screening): The antifungal activity of G. senegalensis leaf extracts and fractions were evaluated against six fungal strains, Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 46645), Aspergillus niger (clinical isolate), Candida albicans (SC5314), Candida glabrata (ATCC 2001), Fusarium lini (environmental isolate), Microsporum canis (ATCC 36299), and Trichophyton rubrum (clinical isolate) using the broth microdilution method. (13), with minor modifications. Preparation of Fungal Inoculum: Fungal strains were cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) and incubated at 28 °C for 48-72 hours. Spores or yeast cells were harvested using sterile saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 80 and adjusted to a final concentration of approximately1 × 10⁶ spores/ml, using a hemocytometer.  Microdilution Assay: In sterile 96-well micro-titer plates, 100 µL of Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) was dispensed into each well. Serial two-fold dilutions of the test extracts and fractions were prepared in the wells to achieve different concentrations. Subsequently, 100 µL of fungal inoculum was added to each well, with final volume 200 µL /well. The plates were incubated at 28°C for 48 hours under sterile conditions. Assessment of Fungal Growth: After incubation, fungal growth was assessed visually and by measuring linear growth (in mm). Additionally, 20µL of 0.01% (w/v) Resazurin solution was added to each well as a viability indicator.  Blue-to-pink color shift indicated fungal viability and metabolic activity.  Determination of Antifungal Activity: Antifungal efficacy was determined by calculating the percentage inhibition of fungal growth compared to the negative control. The % inhibition was calculated using the following formula:  % inhibition = 100 − !"#$%&	(&)*+,	"#	+$-+	(//)!"#$%&	(&)*+,	"#	1)#+&)2	(//)  x 100 The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Determination: The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the test extract or fraction that resulted in no visible fungal growth or no color change in the resazurin dye, indicating complete growth inhibition. Statistical Analysis:   All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for both anti-leishmanial and cytotoxicity assays were calculated using dose response curves generated in Microsoft Excel. Absorbance readings at 540 mm were used to assess cell viability following treatment with varying concentration of plant extracts and fractions. Percentage inhibition (% inhibition) was calculated relative to untreated controls, and non-linear regression was applied to IC50 values. The IC50 was defined as the concentration of the test sample that resulted in 50% inhibition of parasite or cell viability. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. For antibacterial and antifungal assays, for antibacterial and antifungal assays, the percentage inhibition of microbial growth was calculated relative to untreated controls. Differences between treated and control groups were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Results:  Isolation and Identification of Bio-active compounds: The bioactive compounds in G. senegalensis were identified through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectral data (1H, 2D, 13C NMR), along with mass spectral data and comparison with previously Research Article   Atia et al (2025) J Exp Molec Biol 26(3):x-xx; DOI: 10.47743/jemb-2025-238  www.jemb.bio.uaic.ro Page 5 of 11  published data from the National Library of Medicine. The fractions of the ethanolic extract of G. senegalensis were analyzed using (1H and 13C NMR), mass spectral analysis, and GC-MS chromatography.

Cytotoxicity screening: The cytotoxicity of the G. senegalensis extract was assessed alongside standard drugs (Table 1), and demonstrated less than 50% cytotoxicity against 3T3 cells, indicating no significant toxicity at the tested concentrations.

In contrast, standard antibiotics exhibited broad-spectrum potency with over 89% inhibition. The selective activity against B. subtilis suggests a potential affinity for Gram-positive bacteria, likely due to phytochemicals such as flavonoids or alkaloids. While less potent than conventional drugs, the extract’s activity supports further fractionation and optimization to identify and enhance its active constituents (Table 2.).

Supplementary file). Discussion: Phytochemical analysis of G. senegalensis revealed rich profile of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, tri-terpenes (α- and β-amyrin), sterols (daucosterol), and phenolic compounds such as ethyl gallate. These are widely recognized for their antimicrobial and anti-parasitic activities, which likely underpin the bioactivity observed in this study. Flavonoids are known to disrupt microbial membranes, interfere with nucleic acid synthesis, and alter energy metabolism, thereby exhibiting broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties (17). In the context of leishmaniasis, several flavonoids induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Leishmania spp., leading to apoptotic-like cell death (18). Likewise, tri-terpenes such as α- and β-amyrin have been shown to impair parasite membrane integrity and modulate host immune responses. (19). Among the tested extract and fractions, the hexane fraction exhibited the most potent anti-leishmanial activity (IC₅₀ = 16.69 ± 0.3 µg/mL), supporting the presence of active non-polar constituents particularly tri-terpenoids and sterols. Although less potent than standard drugs Compound     Standard Drug\s Amphotericin B 3.39±0.03 Highly potent (Ref.) Pentamidine 4.39±0.01 Highly potent (Ref.)

Key compounds (α-amyrin, β-amyrin, ethyl gallate, and daucosterol) were successfully isolated and are likely responsible for this activity. Their identification provides a promising foundation for further structural and mechanistic studies.  The extract also displayed selective antibacterial activity, against Bacillus subtilis (60.31% inhibition), consistent with the preferential action of flavonoids and alkaloids on gram-positive bacteria (16). While less effective than standard antibiotics (90-96% inhibition).this result supports further bio-guided purification. However, the extract did not exhibit significant antifungal activity, in contrast to earlier studies. The observed antifungal effect was modest and varied by strain, with partial inhibition noted against Trichophyton rubrum and Fusarium lini, while Candida albicans remained resistant. This aligns with previous findings suggesting that antifungal properties in G. senegalensis are associated with compounds such as guieranone A and phenolic acids (5). Against Candida albicans, remain inconsistent (20). While the extract has demonstrated antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis (21).  Importantly, the isolation of specific compounds from the hexane fraction confirms the presence of pharmacologically relevant molecules with selective anti-parasitic activity. These findings position G. senegalensis as a promising candidate for the discovery of novel anti-leishmanial agents. Future efforts should focus on detailed mechanistic studies and in vivo validation to assess efficacy, safety, and potential for therapeutic development. This study has limitations. All bioactivity assays were conducted in vitro, and the antimicrobial screening was limited to a select panel of pathogens. Therefore, further research including in vivo models and expanded microbial testing is essential to fully establish the clinical relevance and translational potential of G. senegalensis derived compounds. Conclusion: This study highlights G. senegalensis as a promising source of bioactive compounds with selective anti-leishmanial properties. The hexane fraction, in particular, demonstrated significant activity against Leishmania major with low cytotoxicity, and the successful isolation of compounds such as α-amyrin, β-amyrin, ethyl gallate, and daucosterol strengthens its potential as a lead for drug development. Although the crude extract exhibited modest antimicrobial activity, its selective effect against Gram-positive bacteria supports further purification and optimization.
