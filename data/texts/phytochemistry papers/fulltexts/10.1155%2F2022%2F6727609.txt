Most Bulbophyllum species are epiphytic and located in habitats that range from subtropical dryforests to wet montane cloud forests. In many cultures, the genus Bulbophyllum has a religious, protective, ornamenting,cosmetic, and medicinal role. Detailed investigations into the molecular pharmacological mechanisms and numerous bio-logical effects of Bulbophyllum spp. remain ambiguous./e review focuses on an in-depth discussion of studies containing dataon phytochemistry and preclinical pharmacology. /us, the purpose of this review was to summarize the therapeutic potentialof Bulbophyllum spp. biocompounds. Data were collected from several scientific databases such as PubMed and ScienceDirect,HindawiEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineVolume 2022, Article ID 6727609, 15 pageshttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6727609other professional websites, and traditional medicine books to obtain the necessary information. Evidence from pharma-cological studies has shown that various phytoconstituents in some Bulbophyllum species have different biological health-promoting activities such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotective. Notoxicological effects have been reported to date. Future clinical trials are needed for the clinical confirmation of biologicalactivities proven in preclinical studies. Although orchid species are cultivated for ornamental purposes and have a widetraditional use, the novelty of this review is a summary of biological actions from preclinical studies, thus supportingethnopharmacological data.1. IntroductionOrchids are the largest group of angiosperms consisting ofnearly 28,000 species with over 736 genera [1]. Althoughorchids are found in natural habitats in several parts of theworld, their presence is decreasing due to great demand bythe population [2]. Due to habitat destruction and indis-criminate collection, Orchid species are at a steady loss [3].One of the most represented genera is Bulbophyllum/ouars (Orchidaceae: subfamily Epidendroideae, subtribeBulbophyllinae) with ca. 2,200 species distributed in Africaand Asia (China, Nepal, India,/ailand, Laos, and Vietnam)[4]. /e taxonomic history of Bulbophyllum has beencomplex since its establishment [5]. /e great dimensionand indefinite infrageneric systematics of this genus bringsignificant difficulties, reducing evolution, ecology, andmorphology research [6]. Taxonomists have reported at least24 closely related genera, classified based on floral mor-phology [7]. Only recently, molecular biology techniqueshave allowed recognizing this genus as monophyletic, i.e.,belonging to a common ancestor [8].Most Bulbophyllum species are epiphytic and located inhabitats that range from subtropical dry forests to wetmontane cloud forests [9, 10]. /ey exclusively obtain waterand nutrients from air, rain, and debris and thus must beable to overcome difficult environmental conditions bystoring water in the pseudobulbs [11]. In addition to theeconomic importance attributable to ornamental uses,herbal medicinal properties of phytochemical substances ofbiological interest (such as flavonoids, sterols-terpenoids,and phenolic acids) in Bulbophyllum species have also beenreported [12, 13]. Several studies report both the phyto-chemical compounds and the molecules’ biological effectsextracted from Bulbophyllum leaf, pseudobulb, and root, fortraditional medicine treatments [14].In a continuous effort by researchers to discover thebiological activities of Bulbophyllum species, we describeand summarize recent research in ethnobotanical knowl-edge, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties,along with the limitations of the research in our article.2. MethodologyTo conduct this review, data were collected from research inseveral scientific databases, such as PubMed and Science-Direct, using the following MeSH terms: “Orchidaceae/chemistry∗,” “Plant Extracts/chemistry,” “Drugs, Herbal/chemistry,” “Molecular Structure,” “Anti-InflammatoryAgents/chemistry,” “Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry.” /estudy included documents written in English language thatdiscussed ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and bio-logical activities of these species. /e taxonomy of thespecies has been validated according to the Plant List[15, 16].3. Botany, Species, and Distribution3.1. Botanical Aspects. Plants of the genus Bulbophyllum areepilithic herbs, sympodial with roots creeping over thesurface of the substrate or aerial, and filamentous to fibrous[17]. Orchid plants, such as Australian Bulbophyllum min-utissimum, differ in size and weight from a gram to a fewmillimetres (1–1.5mm across) [18]. /e stems differentiateinto rhizome and pseudobulb, and the leaves may be ovate,lanceolate, or orbiculate and variable in size on an individualplant [19]. Leaves are terminal on the pseudobulb (one orseveral per shoots) and conduplicate to the substrate. Re-cently, Piazza et al. [20] studied the vegetative anatomy of 13species of Bulbophyllum belonging to sections Didactyle andXiphizusa to elucidate the anatomical characters betweenand among the sections. /e results revealed the anatomicaldifferences among the species of both lipophilic secretionsections in young leaf trichomes and the presence ofxeromorphic characters. Adaptations of both species todifferent environmental conditions were among the maindifferences described by the authors [20]./e inflorescence is racemose and presents many lateralflowers emerging from the rhizome, often at the base of thepseudobulb [19]. Some orchid species in the genus Bulbo-phyllum show an elaborated floral architecture, in additionto their characteristic floral odours that attract and bringspecific pollinators [21]. /e dorsal sepal is free, similar, orsmaller than the lateral sepals./e latter are united basally toeach other and a column foot forms a mentum, free or fusedfurther [19]. /e lateral petals are free and smaller than thedorsal sepals, and the lip of the flowers is trilobed with a largecallus. In some species, the lip flaps with the wind, tosimulate a fly shaking its wings to attract insects [9]. /elabellum is hinged to the tip of the column foot; the lamina iseither not lobed, obscurely 3-lobed, unornamented, or with2 longitudinal keels. /e column lacks the free filament andstyle; the column wings are fused to the column and reducedto teeth that project beside the anther [9]. /e ovary,composed of three fused carpels and the mature seed pod,opens down the middle between the lines of juncture. /eovules are arranged along the ridges inside the ovary and donot develop until sometime after the flower [9]. Orchidflowers attract specific insect species by deceiving males with2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinean imitation signal of female odour and mimetic appearance[22]. For example, the ginger orchid (Bulbophyllum patensKing) flower releases a ginger essence called zingerone thatattracts fruit flies sensitive to methyl eugenol and raspberryketone [22, 23]. Also, the flowers of Bulbophyllum apertumSchltr. release the volatile compound raspberry ketone withthe function of attracting raspberry ketone-sensitive Bac-trocera species [23]./e seeds of Bulbophyllum species consist of a dry, outercoat enclosing a small mass of undifferentiated cells thatform a proembryo [17]. /ey are fusiform, spindle, andnarrowly ellipsoidal shaped and less than 1mm in lengthwithout endosperm [24]. /is extremely small and light unitcan easily be carried in through air currents and may travellong distances before coming to rest [17]. Seed volume isrelated to seed size and Bulbophyllum species, and the higherseed volume is a result of greater width rather than testalength [24]. In natural conditions, the seeds have specificgermination requirements provided by mycorrhizal fungi.For instance, seeds infected by a specific fungus can eithergerminate or be destroyed [25]. /ere are different seedmorphologies among the plants of the genus Bulbophyllum.For example, Bulbophyllummysorense seeds are transparent,short, and spindle to oblong with blunt ends, and the testacells have marginal clavate ridges, smooth on the outer facewith longitudinally oriented cells resembling a twisted rope[26].3.2. Bulbophyllum Species and Cultivation. Every year, somenew Bulbophyllum species are described, making this genusgrow steadily [27]. Due to the extraordinary diversity, ageneral description would be too extensive [1, 27]. Over 50generic names have been proposed, in addition to Bulbo-phyllum [19].In 2005, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,Environment, and Water Management as the CITESManagement Authority of Austria elaborated three lists(names, accepted names, and the checklist) for the Bulbo-phyllum genus, produced by the Botanical Garden of Vienna[28]. /e list is an approach to handle the vast number ofspecies of this genus [28]. Recently, Bulbophyllum is into asingle genus [7, 19]. In 2019, the World Checklist of SelectedPlant Families [29] published an updated and exhaustive listthat comprises over 2000 epiphytic Bulbophyllum species./ere have been many efforts to split off segregate generabased on morphological characteristics. As reported by theAmerican Orchid Society [30], some of the common Bul-bophyllum species are as follows: Bulbophyllum dearei,Bulbophyllum echinolabium, Bulbophyllum falcatum, Bul-bophyllum fascinator, Bulbophyllum flabellum-veneris, Bul-bophyllum guttulatum, Bulbophyllum lasiochilum,Bulbophyllum lobbii, Bulbophyllum longissimum, Bulbo-phyllum makoyanum, Bulbophyllum medusae, and Bulbo-phyllum putidum. Two hybrids, Bulbophyllum Daisy Chainand Bulbophyllum Elizabeth discovered recently, are par-ticularly attractive [30]. Among this ecological group, newtaxa were also discovered: Bulbophyllum cariniflorumReichenbach var. orloviiAver., Bulbophyllum soniiAver. andN. V. Duy, Bulbophyllum ustulata Aver., Bulbophyllumcariniflorum, Bulbophyllum flavescens Lindley, Bulbo-phyllum ovatum Seidenfaden, Bulbophyllum physocoryphumSeidenfaden, and Bulbophyllum wendlandianum Dammer.Regarding the environmental conditions of cultivation,the warm temperature is suitable for Bulbophyllum plantsthat grow with a minimum of 22°C in winter, though speciesfrom temperate regions are grown 5–10 degrees cooler [30].Light can be moderate to bright (2000 to 3500 candle feet): ahigher light, which does not damage the leaves, seems toproduce a better and more frequent flowering [30]. Bul-bophyllum species tend to prefer a minimum of repottingusing fern or cork slabs, baskets, and well-draining pots andthe recommended impregnation media are sphagnummoss,coconut (flakes or coconut fibres), and tree fern both hor-izontally and vertically, whereas the relative humidity shouldbe around 90% inside a greenhouse [31]. High relativehumidity with a high air movement rate and constant freshair are decisive parameters for the health and successfulcultivation of the plants [31]. During the growth cycle, plantsneed adequate nutrition using standard fertilizers at 1/4 ofthe concentration given for houseplants [30]. /e plants areusually rapid growers, reporting no major problems withpests. Propagation is through the division of the bulbs or viaseeds of excellent germination rates [31]. Manual pollinationof Bulbophyllum phalaenopsis, Bulbophyllum spies, andBulbophyllum strontium has so far not been successful [31].3.3. Geographical Distribution. /e taxa of the genus Bul-bophyllum are pantropical, spreading across Africa, Aus-tralia, India, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, and tropical Southand Central America [32] (Figure 1)./e orchids, as epiphytes, are believed to be lessadaptable to anthropogenic environmental variations thanother plants [33]. /e availability of the specificity host treeplays a central role in influencing the distribution andabundance of epiphytic orchids, often causing their unequalgeographical distribution, even within a single tree [11].Most of the Bulbophyllum species is epiphytes and ispresent in the virgin pantropical forest in the lower Montaneforest at 1000m above sea level [32]. However, a majornumber of species arise in the Indo-Malayan region [34]. Of1000 species from India, 62 species are in the Northeasternregion, 14 species in South India, and the remaining fromother parts of India [35]. Madagascar is the hub of Bulbo-phyllum diversity (over 210 spp.), found mainly as epiphytesin a wide range of rainforest environments [36].Madagascan Bulbophyllum molecular studies evidencedthe existence of a monophyletic group of Late Miocene agewith two major lineages: a species-rich core clade, mainlydistributed in eastern rainforest of mid-to-high elevation (c.800–1300m), and a species-poor clade that is ecogeo-graphically wide-ranging [37].According to research, about 105 species of Bulbo-phyllum are present in China [38, 39]. Bulbophyllum/ouars is one of the largest genera among the orchid family,with around 2000 species in the tropical and subtropicalzone of the world [40].Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3Up to date, Vietnam has documented 122 species of thegenus Bulbophyllum [41]. Recent studies have allowedidentifying four new species of Bulbophyllum in Vietnam,namely Bulbophyllum flavescens (sect. Aphanobulbon),Bulbophyllum ovatum (sect. Desmosanthes), Bulbophyllumphysocoryphum (sect. Macrocaulia), and Bulbophyllumwendlandianum (sect. Cirrhopetalum) [40]. /ese speciesare endemic of the Indochinese Peninsula, except for Bul-bophyllum flavescens, which is widely distributed in westernMalesia [40]. /e “vinaceous orchid” (Bulbophyllum vina-ceum Ames and C. Schweinf) is a rare epiphytic plant en-demic to the highlands of Borneo Island, such as the CrockerRange and Mt. Kinabalu of Sabah [21].4. Ethnopharmacology/e usage of orchids in Ayurvedic or folklore treatment iscommon in many parts of the world, which raised immenseattention to explore their pharmacological properties andbioactive constituents in-depth./e genus Bulbophyllum hasan important role in many cultures acting as a religious,protective, ornamenting, cosmetic, and medicinal means.Leaves, pseudobulbs, and flowers of Bulbophyllum sp. haveethnobotanical importance and are used for various ail-ments, for both external and internal applications and ad-ministrations by tribal peoples. B. neilgherrense is anepiphytic plant used by the South Indian tribes to treat heartdisease, leukoderma, skin allergy, and rheumatism; itspseudobulb is the most used part for traditional remedies./e uses of B. scaberulum in South African traditionalmedicine were observed for pain-related ailments, recom-mending further studies to explore the chemical profile andinteractions between different classes of compounds andbiological/pharmacological activities.In Cameroon, Bulbophyllum falcatum and Bulbophyllumlupulinum are used against sorcery [2]. At the same time,leaves of Bulbophyllum falcatum are used for predictions,and the whole plant of Bulbophyllum simonii is used as a luckpotion [2]. Bulbophyllum shanicum is offered in many re-ligious ceremonies and used by Kayaladies for ornamentingtheir hair [42]. Bulbophyllum simonii and Bulbophyllumlilacinum are mixed in body lotion to keep the body freshand cool [2, 12].Fluids from cleaned pseudobulbs of Bulbophyllum lila-cinum are extracted by the press, kept in a sealed jarovernight, and then mixed with water and taken as a cooldrink [12]. Powder of Bulbophyllum melinostachyum isrecommended as anti-poisons [2].In Zimbabwe, bark from species of the Bulbophyllumgenus is tied around a fracture as a supporting pad [43].Also, in different countries, many species of the Bulbo-phyllum genus are used as traditional herbal medicines(Table 1).5. Phytochemistry/e spectroscopic analyses carried out by several investi-gations highlighted the phytochemicals of plants belongingto the genus Bulbophyllum. Although these studies are rare,their identification results have revealed a remarkablerichness in the chemical composition of the genus Bulbo-phyllum. /e identified compounds are shown in Table 2,and the molecular chemical structures (majority com-pounds) are schematized by ChemDraw and are shown inFigure 2. Note in Table 2, the 17 species belong to the genusBulbophyllum (B. odoratissimum, B. kaitense, B. weddellii,B. involutum, B. ipanemense, B. retusiusculum,B. neilgherrens, B. variegatum, B. vaginatum, B. protractum,B. reptans, B. cheiri, B. retusiusculum, B. kwangtungense,B. taeniophyllum, B. ambrosia, and B. echinolabium).Numerous chemical compounds in B. odoratissimumbelong to different chemical families, in particular phen-anthrene and phenanthraquinone. Chen et al. [56] identified3,7-dihydroxy-2,4,6-trimethoxyphenanthrene, while thesame author identified, 7-hydroxy-2,3,4-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, coelonin, densiflorol B, gigantol,batatasin III, tristin, vanillic acid, and syringaldehyde asmajor compounds in 2008 Moscatin [56]. Additionally, Xuet al. [59] identified bulbophythrin A and bulbophythrinB. B. odoratissimum was also reported to contain 5-(2-benzo[1,3]dioxole-5-ylethyl)-6-methoxy benzo[1,3]dioxole-4-ol(1) and 5-(2-benzo[1,3]dioxole-5-ylethyl)benzo[1,3]dioxole-4,7-diol [60]./e chemical compounds of Bulbophyllum weddellii,Bulbophyllum involutum, and Bulbophyllum ipanemensewere characterized by Da Silva et al. [62]. In this study,several chemical compounds were identified includingfurfural, 2-furanomethanol, 5-methyl-2(3H)-furanone, 2,3-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3-furanone, 2-methoxy-phenol, maltol, 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyrene-4-one, 1,2-benzenediol, 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenol,2,6-dimethoxyphenol, 4-hydroxy methyl benzoate, 4-hy-droxy-3-methoxy methyl benzoate, 2,6-dimethyl-3-methoxymethyl-p-benzoquinone, tetradecanoic acid, pen-tadecanoic acid, and hexadecanoic acid [62]./e chemical compounds of the plant B. kaitense werereported by Kalaiarasan et al. [61]. /e authors observed thatthis plant contained numerous compounds belonging to dif-ferent classes such as ether compound (propane, 1,1-diethoxy),hydrocarbon (cyclopentane, 2-methylbutyl), plasticizer com-pound (1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, butyl 2-methylpropylester), ketone compound (2-nonanone, 9-hydroxy), aromaticalcoholic compound (2,4-dimethylcyclopentanol), alcoholiccompound (3-buten-2-ol), iodo compound (nonane, 1-iodo),plasticizer compound (didodecyl phthalate), alcoholic com-pound (3,4-hexanediol, 2,5-dimethyl), ketone compound(fluorenone, 2,3,4,7-tetramethoxy), triterpene (squalene),Figure 1: Geographical distribution of Bulbophyllum species.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinebromo compound (methyl 3-bromo-1-adamantaneacetate),and aromatic compound (1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene) [77]./e identification of chemical compounds ofB. vaginatum begun in 1997 by the study of Yuan-WahLeong et al. [68]. /is work revealed the presence of dif-ferent chemical compounds belonging to several chemicalfamily such as phenanthrenes (4,9-dimethoxyphenan-threne-2,5-diol and 4,6 dimethoxyphenanthrene-2,3,7-triol,3,4,6-trimethenanthrene-2,7-diol, 3,4-dimethox-yphenanthrene-2,7-diol (nudol), 2,4 dimethoxyphenan-threne-3,7-diol, 3,5-dimeth-oxyphenanthrene-2,7-diol, 4methoxyphenanthrene-2,3,5-triol (fimbriol B),4-methox-yphenan-threne-2,7-diol (flavanthrinin)), less bibenzyls(3,4′-dihydroxy-5,5′-dimethoxybibenzyl and 3,3′-dihy-droxy-5-methoxybibenzyl) (batatasin III), and triterpenoidfriedelin [68].In the same year, B. protractum was found to containnumerous bioactive compounds including bulbophyllin, bul-bophyllidin, batatasin III (3,3′-dihydroxy-5-methoxybibenzyl), 3,3′,5-trimethoxybibenzyl, aloifol-I (3′,4-dihydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybibenzyl), 3,3′-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenediox-ybibenzyl, flavidin (2,7-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydro-5H-phenan-thro[4,5-bcd]pyran), dihydroconiferyl alcohol, stigmasterol,and sitosterol [69]. In addition, B. reptans was found to be richin dimeric phenanthrenes (reptanthrin and isoreptanthrin) andstilbenoids (gymnopusin, confusarin, 2,7 dihydroxy-3,4,6-tri-methoxyphenanthrene, flavanthrinin, cirrhopetalanthrin) [70].Furthermore, B. cheiri contains several phenylpropanoids(eugenol, methyl eugenol, cis-methyl isoeugenol, trans-methyl isoeugenol, 2-allyl-4,5-dimethoxyphenol, 5-allyl-1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene (euasarone), and trans-3,4-dime-thoxycinnamyl acetate) [71], while only two phenylpropanoid(bobulretulate A, bobulretulate B) esters were identified inB. retusiusculum (extracts) [72]. In contrast, six dihy-drodibenzoxepins (7,8-dihydro-5-hydroxy-12,13-methyl-enedioxy-11-methoxyldibenz[B,F]oxepin, 7,8-dihydro-4-hydroxy-12,13-methylenedioxy-11-methoxyldibenz[B,F]oxe-pin,

phyto-chemical compounds belonging to phenylpropanoids suchas retusiusine A, retusiusine B, (±)-retusiusine C, dihy-droconiferyl dihydro-p-coumarate, methyl 3-(4-hydrox-yphenyl) propionate,

In addition,bibenzyl (bulbotetusine) and flavone C-glycoside (apigenin6-C-α-arabinofuranosyl 8-C-α-arabinopyranoside) havealso been identified in this plant [64]./e phytochemical compounds of Bulbophyllum varie-gatum were also identified [66]. /e finding revealed thepresence of several chemical families in this plant such as al-cohols (2-ethylhexanol, 2-nonanol), aldehydes (nonanal anddecanal), ketones (2-heptanone, 2-nonanone), acids (acetic acid,propanoic acid), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (beta-elemene,(E)-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene), nitrogenous compounds(trimethylamine, methoxyphenyloxime, indole), sulphur com-pounds (methyl thioacetate, benzothiazole), and aromaticcompounds (toluene, p-cresol, p-cresyl acetate) [66].B. neilgherrens is another medicinal species of the genusBulbophyllum.Only qualitative analysis of the chemical contentsof this species was carried out by Kumari et al. [65]. /e resultsshowed the presence of different chemical classes in this plantsuch as alkaloids, saponin glycosides, tannins, phenols, flavo-noids, and steroids [65].Both the quantitative and qualitative differences inchemical composition across species of the genus Bulbo-phyllum are due to the physiology and genetics of the species.However, other factors such as climate, soil, parts used, andphenological stages of the plants can also affect the sec-ondary metabolite synthesis in these species.Recent studies show that chemical composition can varywithin the same species, in different environments, and inextraction systems.6. Biological Activities6.1. Antimicrobial and Antifungal Activities.Phytochemical screening of different solvent extracts (pe-troleum ether, chloroform, ethanol, and water) collectedfrom stems of terrestrial orchid B. kaitense in Kolli Hills,India, confirms the presence of terpenoids, flavonoids, re-ducing sugars, phenols, catechins, saponins, tannins, an-thraquinone, quinine, coumarin, glycosides, andalpha-Humulene Batatasin III beta-ElemeneIsoreptanthrinLinalool Campesterol CaryophylleneCirrhopetalidin Confusarin Tristin GigantolDensiflorol BDensiflorol A Flavanthrinin Friedelin StigmasterolPlicatol B Serine L-phenylalanine Gymnopusin MuscatilinOHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOOOOOOOO O OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOHOHOHOHOOH OHOHHHHHHHOHOHOHOH OHOHOHOH OHOHOHOHOHHH HHH2NH2NFigure 2: Phytochemical compounds identified in different Bulbophyllum species schematized by ChemDraw.8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinecarbohydrates. Ethanol and chloroform extracts showgreater antifungal activity than petroleum ether and aqueousextracts, whereas the antibacterial activity in petroleum etherextract showed less effect than that reported in chloroform,ethanol, and aqueous extracts [61]./ere are many orchids with different medicinalproperties and antibacterial activity. B. neilgherrense wastested for antibacterial activity against five bacterial species(Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida). Etha-nolic, chloroform, and aqueous extracts (concentration of5.50 w/v) from leaves and pseudobulbs were prepared for thedisk diffusion method of antimicrobial sensitivity testing./e ethanolic extract of both leaves and pseudobulbs wasmore effective. /e bacterial species P. aeruginosa andP. putida showed greater sensitivity to the pseudobulbethanolic extract, while the ethanolic extract from leaves waseffective against E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa.However, all extracts were less effective than standard an-tibiotic streptomycin, when tested with the disk diffusionmethod in vitro [78].In another study, Fang et al. [63] identified new phe-nylpropanoids in tubers of B. retusiusculum, which werethen tested for their antimicrobial activities. /e antimi-crobial tests were performed against E. coli, B. subtilis, andCandida albicans, where kanamycin (4 μg/mL) and nystatin(4 μg/mL) were positive controls for measuring antibacterialand antifungal activity potencies, respectively. Retusiusine Bexhibited potent antifungal activity against C. albicans(16 μg/mL), and (±)-retusiusine C enantiomers showedmoderate antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (64 μg/mL)[63].B. affine has moderate bactericidal activity againstStaphylococcus aureus (a common cause of skin infections)but none against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia,Escherichia coli, or Vibrio cholera [79]./e orchid species B. careyanum and B. leopardinum arecommonly used in burn treatments [80] although antimi-crobial testing has not been reported for these species. In asimilar study, B. neilgherrense exhibited moderate antibac-terial activity against five infectious bacterial species [78],while promising antifungal activity against ten pathogenicfungal strains was reported from the same orchid species[81].Phenylpropanoids isolated from Bulbophyllum retu-siusculum exhibited moderate antibacterial activity againstBacillus subtilis (64 μg/mL) and potent antifungal activityagainst Candida albicans (16 μg/mL) [63]. Bulbophyllumkaitense stem extract was also effective against 10 differentbacterial strains with greater sensitivity to fungal strains[61].In the light of these results, the antibacterial activity oforchids is a good alternative for preventing/treating infectionsinstead of using antibiotics, which have many side effects.6.2. Antioxidant Activity. Natural plant products have beenused as poultices and/or anti-inflammatory drugs and an-tioxidants for many years [82, 83].Chinsamy et al. [84] reported antioxidant activity ofBulbophyllum scaberulum higher than other South Africanorchid species. /e overall average antioxidant activity (%ANT) of B. scaberulum pseudobulb and root extracts washigher than 90%, which might validate the use of species totreat certain inflammatory disorders./e antioxidant effects and inhibition of acetylcholin-esterase (AchE) enzyme from several indigenous orchidspecies (including B. Scaberulum) were evaluated. In theirstudies, the methanolic extracts of leaves, pseudobulbs, androots of B. Scaberulum (similar to other orchids the extracts)showed high antioxidant potential with 100% average an-tioxidant activity (ANT) as compared to the standard BHTdrug (95.88%), when tested with β-carotene bleaching assay./ey also found that the ethanol root extract at 5 and0.5mg/m exhibited significant mutagenic effects comparableto the 4NQO drug. Similarly, the dichloromethane extract ofroots significantly inhibit AchE with the lowest IC50 value of0.02mg/ml, while the ethanol extract showed less activityagainst AchE.Recently, Sun et al. [85] purified several compoundsfrom B. retusiusculum whole plants. New phenanthrene,bobulretin, and two bibenzyls were evaluated againstα-glucosidase activity in vitro. All three compounds showedless than 20% inhibition when tested at the final concen-tration of 4.37×10−4mol/L.Similarly, Bulbophyllum sp. exhibited higher antioxidantactivity when compared to four other epiphytic orchids [86].Plants of B. kaitense also presented good antioxidant activityand are considered a source of plant-derived antioxidants[87].Polyphenols such as chrysin and pinobanksin found inorchid species of the genus Bulbophyllum have antioxidanteffects [65, 88, 89], thus supporting their use in various heartdiseases by the folklore traditions.6.3. Anti-Inflammatory Activity. Nair et al. [54] used thepseudobulb powder of B. neilgherrense to examine analgesicand anti-inflammatory activities using different rat models./e pseudobulb powder mixed with honey and waterrevealed central analgesic activity against radiant heat-in-duced pain, moderate anti-inflammatory activity againstcarrageenan-induced acute inflammation, and mild ornegligible activity against formalin-induced subacute in-flammation and pain in rats. Pseudobulb contains flavonoids(chrysin and quercetin), glycosides, tannin, phenolic com-pounds, and calcium and may play a fundamental role inobserved analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities [54].A study run by Kumari et al. [65] reported that thepseudobulb of B. neilgherrense contains alkaloids, tannis,phenols, flavonoids, steroids, saponin glycosides, andreducing sugar (almost the same compounds as foundearlier by Nair and his coworkers). /e amounts oftannins, sugars, and alkaloids were 0.828%, 8.96%, and0.3%, respectively (w/w). Of these, chrysin (a flavonoid)inhibited COX-2 expression and IL-6 signalling, indi-cating that B. neilgherrense pseudobulbs have anti-in-flammatory potential [65].Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9B. kaitense was examined in vitro for its anti-inflam-matory activity using the human red blood cell (HRBC)method [77]. While petroleum ether, chloroform, andaqueous extracts exhibited various anti-inflammatory ac-tivities, the ethanolic extract of B. kaitense pseudobulbsshowed potent anti-inflammatory activity. As south Indianorchids, some South African medicinal orchids also dem-onstrated notable anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting theirpotential in treating inflammation and related disorders.A study conducted by Chinsamy et al. [84] reported thatthe dichloromethane, ethanol, and aqueous root extract ofB. scaberulum had selective and significant COX-2 inhibi-tion effects. Inhibition was 100.00, 93.31, and 58.09%, re-spectively, and dichloromethane and ethanol extract IC50values against COX-2 were 1.43 and 0.44mg/ml, respec-tively. Surprisingly, the dichloromethane root extractsshowed a greater inhibition performance than the com-mercial drug galantamine for COX-2. In contrast, waterextracts from leaves and pseudobulbs exhibited moderateeffects on COX-2, but no effect on COX-1. /e COX-2inhibition effects of B. scaberulum suggested that it was dueto condensed tannins present in the stems and/or roots [84].Gowlis of Karnataka use a paste of pseudobulbs ofBulbophyllum neilgherrense Wight. for arthritis [90]. A studyvalidated this trait and concluded that the pseudobulbpowder had central analgesic activity against radiant heat-induced pain and moderate anti-inflammatory activityagainst carrageenan-induced acute inflammation [54]. /eauthors suggest that the potential mode of action ofB. neilgherrense Wight. pseudobulb was due to the presenceof flavonoids (chrysin and quercetin) in the plants [65] asseveral flavonoids such as hesperidin, luteolin, and quercetinhave anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects [91]. Similarly,chrysin and quercetin have significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities [92]. However, a 50% ethanolicextract of B. gymnopus Hook f. failed to show antimicrobialor anti-inflammatory activity and did not affect eitherrespiration, cardiovascular system, or central nervous sys-tem, in experimental animals [93].Aqueous pseudobulb extracts of B. scaberulum showedpoor or no COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition [84]. Interestingly,the organic extracts (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, andethanol) of B. scaberulum showed higher activity in the samestudy.Bulbophyllum kaitense has been used in indigenousmedicine by local healers of the Kolli hills. Its anti-in-flammatory validation has been reported using human redblood cell (HRBC) membrane stabilizationmethod [46]./eHRBCmembrane stabilization assay uses the HRBCmethodas analogous to lysosomal membrane components, and thus,the inhibition of hypotonicity or heat-induced red blood cellmembrane lysis may be taken as a measure of the anti-in-flammatory activity mechanism of extracts.6.4. Anticancer Activity. Numerous studies report thatBulbophyllum species have in vitro cytotoxicity activity./e phenanthrenes isolated from Bulbophyllum odor-atissimum and Bulbophyllum inconspicuum showedsignificant cytotoxicity against various cancer lines suchas the human leukaemia cell lines K562, HL-60, andSMMC-7721 [59, 94]. Similarly, dihydrodibenzoxepinsisolated from Bulbophyllum kwangtungense also exhibi-ted antitumour activities against HeLa and K562 humantumour cell lines [73]. Chen et al. [56] isolated andstudied various phenolic compounds from Bulbophyllumodoratissimum as their inhibitory ability against thegrowth of human leukaemia cell lines K562 and HL-60,human lung adenocarcinoma A549, human hepatomaBEL-7402, and human stomach cancer SGC-7901. /eresults indicated a high activity against selective cell lines,i.e., in three compounds where densiflorol was the mostactive compound, followed by syringaldehyde and tristin[57]. /e other compounds evaluated were weak or eitherinactive.Biswas et al. [95] reported that Bulbophyllum sterilepetroleum ether fraction induces apoptosis in vitro andameliorates tumour progression in vivo, suggesting that theactive fractions of bulbs and roots have anticancer activitylikely by inducing apoptosis through the phospho-p53-de-pendent pathway [95]./e extract of B. kwantungense also exhibited anti-tumour activity in vitro against cultivated human cervicalcarcinoma cells (HeLa) [96]. Chen et al. [56] isolatedphenanthrene derivative 3,7-dihydroxy-2,4,6-trimethox-yphenanthrene from B. odoratissimum, and its structure waselucidated by extensive chemical transformations and nu-clear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy spectrumstudies. /e isolated compound showed significant cyto-toxicity against the growth of human leukaemia cell linesHL-60 and K562, human stomach cancer cell line SGC-7901,human hepatoma BEL-7402, and human lung adenocarci-noma A549 with IC50 values of 10.02, 14.23, 1.13, 15.36, and3.42mg/ml, respectively.In an investigation to evaluate the cytotoxicity ofB. kwangtungense, Wu et al. [73] purified three new com-pounds, dihydrodibenzoxepins 7,8-dihydro-5-hydroxy-12,13-methylenedioxy-11-methoxydibenz[bf]oxepin (D5MO), 7,8-dihydro-4-hydroxy-12,13-methylenedioxy-11-methoxydibenz[bf]oxepin (D4MO), and 7,8-dihydro-3-hydroxy-12,13-meth-ylenedioxy-11-methoxyldibenz[bf]oxepin (D3MO), along withcompounds cumulatin, densiflorol A, and plicatol B. Withinthe compounds tested for antitumour properties, D4MO andD3MO exhibited the highest activity against HeLa cells withthe IC50 values of 78.3 and 61.2μM, respectively, while ac-tivities against K562 tumour cells, D3MO, and densiflorol Ashowed the highest activity values with the IC50 of 64.7 and67.6μM, respectively. In another study, two dihydrostillbenes,3-(2-(7-methoxybenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)ethyl)phenol(3MDP) and 6-(3-hydroxyphenethyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-ol(6HBD), previously purified from B. odoratissimum, weresynthesized via the Wittig–Horner reaction and used for de-veloping nine synthetic analogues by Zhang et al. [97]. 3MDPand 6HBD together with their two analogues bearing an aminoacid moiety in place of the phenolic OH of 3MDP and 6HBDwere found to have significant anti-proliferative activity se-lective to two cancer cell lines, SGC-7901 and KB, with IC50value of <10.0μM, while the other analogues showed a10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicinemarkedly reduced cytotoxicity towards all tumour cell lines,SGC-7901, KB, and HT-1080.Chen et al. [57] purified nine phenolic compounds,including moscatin, 7-hydroxy-2,3,4-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, coelonin, densiflorol B, gigantol,batatasin III, tristin, vanillic acid, and syringaldehyde, fromthe ethyl acetate extract of B. odoratissimumwhole plant andinvestigated the cell growth inhibition effects on differenttumour cell lines such as human leukaemia cell lines K562and HL-60, human lung adenocarcinoma A549, humanhepatoma BEL-7402, and human stomach cancer SGC-7901.Except for three compounds such as densiflorol B, tristin,and syringaldehyde, all other compounds showed weak orno activity on tumour cells. Densiflorol B was themost activecompound against all tumour cells showing the IC50 valuesranging from 0.08 to 3.52 μg/ml. Tristin displayed selectivecytotoxicity against SGC-7901, with an IC50 value of 2.08 μg/ml, whereas syringaldehyde exerted a strong activity againstBEL-7402 cells with an IC50 value of 1.54 μg/ml.Two new dimeric phenanthrenes, bulbophythrins A andB, were then purified from B. odoratissimum, and theirinhibitory ability against the growth of the same tumour celllines was evaluated, as previously tested by Chen and hiscoworkers [57], with both compounds exerting significantcytotoxicity against all tumour cell lines [59]. However,bulbophythrin A exhibited some selective cytotoxicityagainst HL-60 and BEL-7402 with IC50 values of 1.27×10−3and 1.22×10−3 μM, respectively, whereas bulbophythrin Aappeared to be most active against A549 with an IC50 valueof 1.18×10−3 μM, suggesting their potential use as a novelclass of antitumour candidate in tumour disease.Petroleum fraction, compared with the alcoholic extracts,from bulbs (PFB) and roots (PFR) of B. sterile, was found to bethe most active in three different cancer cell lines, HCT-116,MDA-MB-231, and A549, by [95]. However, there was sig-nificant cytotoxicity in HCT-116 cells with IC50 values of 94.2and 75.7μg/ml for PFB and PFR, respectively, likely attributedto the effects on the cell cycle G2/M phase with 32.6% and49.4% arrest. In addition, PFB and PFR treatments showed 48%and 38% apoptosis, respectively, when tested with acridineorange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining assay. /eir ap-optosis induction was carried out through phospho-p53-de-pendent pathway. Both fractions lowered tumour volume andincreased life span and hepatic antioxidant level in Ehrlichascites carcinoma (EAC) bearingmice, resulting in lower EAC-induced mortality.In a different report by Yang et al. [64], two compounds, aflavone C-glycoside and bibenzyl purified fromB. retusiusculum tubers, did not show evident cytotoxicity onsix cancer cell lines, including HL-60, SMMC-7721, A549,MCF-7, and SW-480./eir IC50 value was greater than 40μM,and their noncytotoxic effects were previously thought to beattributed to their structural differences to other bibenzylcompounds previously reported to have cytotoxic effects.6.5. Neuroprotective Effect. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is aprogressive neurodegenerative disorder associated withmemory impairment and cognitive deficit [98]. Variousmechanisms, such as AChE inhibition, modification ofmonoamine levels, anti-amyloid aggregation, and antioxi-dant activities, are the strategies that have been employed forthe amelioration of AD symptoms [99, 100]. Of these, one ofthe major approaches has involved addressing the levels ofacetylcholine in the AD-depressed brain using AChE in-hibitors [101]. Most of the currently available drugs areAchEi, and some are related to natural products with animportant therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.Many research groups have focused their studies on natu-rally occurring compounds from plants as potential sourcesof either new or more effective AChEi. Due to the presenceof flavonoids and tannins, orchid extracts that display sig-nificant effects in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and AChEinhibitory assays could be potential natural plant products inthe inflammatory treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.Chinsamy et al. [84] reported anticholinesterase activity(EC50) for different extraction solvents as 0.02± 0.00 and0.26± 0.007mg/ml, respectively, in dichloromethane andethanol root extracts of B. scaberulum. /e authors alsofound that B. scaberulum root extract effectively inhibitedAChE as compared to the commercial product galantamine.6.6. Other Activities. Myanmar women prepare a hair tonicand shampoo by mixing ground pseudobulbs of variousspecies of Bulbophyllum with pulverized bark, seeds, andfruit (species not identified) when washing their hair. /ismixture is claimed to cure dandruff, promote hair growth,and improve hair colour [102].Imbricatin, a stilbenoid isolated previously from Bul-bophyllum and other orchid genera, was one of three isolatedstilbenoids recommended for use as skin photoprotectantsbased on their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immu-nomodulatory effects [103].A summarized scheme of the most representative bio-logical activities is summarized in Figure 3.7. Safety DataNo reports were found in the literature concerning health safetyissues after the consumption of Bulbophyllum. /is plant hasbeen used in ethnomedicine and folk medicine by villagers indifferent conditions for ages; however, the toxicity profile of theBulbophyllum species is still undiscovered. With the increasingcases of poisoning associated with the use of herbal medicinesinmany parts of the world in recent times [104], it is essential toensure safety through toxicity assessment alongside activepharmacovigilance to promote their safe use and protect publichealth. /erefore, it is necessary to identify the risks associatedwith the use of such herbal plants, and in this regard, the safetyof these products has become an issue of great public healthimportance and thus a key moment for considering it inpharmacovigilance systems.8. Limitations and Future Perspective/e data from this review validate the use of certain orchidspecies in ethnopharmacology for various conditions. Morecomprehensive studies of the bioactive compounds ofEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11several Bulbophyllum species would open a new perspectiveon the relationships between chemical profiles, interactionsbetween different classes of chemical compounds, biologicalproperties, and correlation with geographical location./erapeutic limitations of Bulbophyllum species are due toignorance of long-term adverse effects, toxicity, and mu-tagenic potential. Future experimental pharmacologicalresearch is needed to further investigate the molecularmechanisms and action targets of the bioactive compoundscontained in Bulbophyllum species. Another limitation is thelack of clinical trials.9. ConclusionIn recent years, the genus Bulbophyllum is gaining the at-tention of plant researchers because of its rich phyto-chemical profile and variety of biological activities reportedacross species of the genus. Most Bulbophyllum species areepiphytic and found in habitats that range from subtropicaldry forests to wet montane cloud forests. Plants belonging tothe genus Bulbophyllum are mostly epilithic herbs andsympodial with roots creeping over the surface of thesubstrate or aerial, filamentous to fibrous. /e genus Bul-bophyllum has been utilized for protective, religious, cos-metic, ornamenting, and medicinal applications. Numerousinvestigations report the phytochemical compoundsextracted from Bulbophyllum root, pseudobulb, and leaf, andtheir biological effect in traditional medicine treatments.Several phytochemical compounds of biological interestsuch as flavonoids, sterols-terpenoids, and phenolic acidshave been reported in Bulbophyllum species. As summarizedin the present review, the phytochemical composition ofspecies of the genus Bulbophyllum offers insights intoproviding information on the antioxidant, anti-inflamma-tory, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, anticancer, and anticholin-esterase activity. Furthermore, investigations are warrantedto extract the various health-promoting phytochemicals andto identify their bioactivities, which will help to boost theutilization of Bulbophyllum species.Data Availability/edata supporting this review are from previously reportedstudies and datasets, which have been cited. /e processeddata are available from the corresponding author uponrequest.Conflicts of Interest/e authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.Authors’ ContributionsAll authors made a significant contribution to the work.References[1] Y.-K.
