About a dozen of Verbascum species(Scrophulariaceae) are commonly employed in the Kurdish traditional medicine, especially for treatingburns and other skin diseases. However, the isolation of bioactive secondary metabolites from theseplants has not been the subject of intense scientific investigations in Iraq. Therefore, the informationreported in the literature about the species growing in Kurdistan has been summarized in the firstpart of this paper, although investigations have been performed on vegetable samples collected inneighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Iran. In the second part of the work, we have investigated,for the first time, the contents of a methanol and a hydromethanol extract of V. calvum flowers.The extracts exhibited weak antimicrobial activities, whereas the methanol extract showed significantantiproliferative effects against an A549 lung cancer cell line. Moreover, both extracts exhibited asignificant dose-dependent free radical scavenging action against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH) radical, comparable to that of ascorbic acid. In the subsequent phytochemical study, a highphenolic content was determined in both extracts by the Folin–Ciocalteu assay and medium-pressureliquid chromatographic (MPLC) separation led to the isolation of iridoid glucosides ajugol andaucubin from the methanol extract. In conclusion, the high anti-inflammatory effects of aucubinand the remarkable antioxidant (antiradical) properties of the extracts give scientific support to thetraditional use of V. calvum flowers for the preparation in Kurdistan of remedies to cure skin burnsand inflammations.Keywords: phenolics; terpenoids; iridoid; ajugol; aucubin; Verbascum; antiradical activity; Kurdishtraditional medicine1. IntroductionThe majority of Kurds inhabit a mostly mountainous land called Kurdistan that includes adjacentparts of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey.

Figure 1. Kurdish seller of traditional remedies (Photo taken by H.I.M.A.). Herbs used for curing gastro-intestinal disorders clearly predominate. This finding can be due to the abundance of these diseases among the Kurdish people, and/or to the broad applicability of these terms, as they can also include reduction of cholesterol level, abdominal pain, flatulence, colic, etc. Other diseases cured by using plants are related to the circulatory and respiratory systems, the urogenital and the metabolic systems, including diabetes, various types of inflammation and infection, skin burns, and liver problems [4–6].  Despite the wide use of herbal remedies, phytochemical studies on Kurdistan medicinal plants are still in their infancy and only a few papers have been published so far that describe the structures and bioactivities of isolated metabolites [2,3,7–13]. In continuation of our researches on Kurdistan medicinal plants, we direct our attention toward the genus Verbascum (mullein).

This large genus ofthe family Scrophulariaceae has about 130 accepted names in The Plant List database, while about 85are synonyms and the others are unresolved names [14]. Several Verbascum species have been reportedto exhibit antiseptic, astringent, demulcent, emollient, expectorant, sedative, diuretic, antimalarialproperties. Included in different traditional medicines, these plants are used for treating wounds,haemorrhoids, chilblains, respiratory ailments, inflammations, migraine, arthritic problems, acne,eczema and other types of inflammatory skin conditions [15].Numerous Verbascum species grow wild in various ecosystems existing in territories extendingfrom Aegean Islands to Anatolia and Iran. A total of twenty-seven species can be found inIraq, mainly on high-mountain regions [16,17], whereas about fifteen are reported to grow inKurdistan.

Plant MaterialFlowers, le ves, and roots of V. calvum Boiss & Kotschy (Figure 9) were separately collectedon Halgurd mountain (Figure 10) on June 19th, 2011; GPS position: 36◦40′30.40”N, 44◦50′7.40”E.The plant was identified by botanists A. H. Al-khayyat and Abdullah S. A. from the University ofSalahaddin-Hawler/Iraq. A voucher specimen (No. VC 6823) has been deposited at the SalahaddinUniversity herbarium (ESUH). The plant raw materials were air dried at room temperature for 10 daysin a ventilated room, protected from light. After drying, the flowers were powdered by an electricmill grinder.3.3. Extraction of V. Calvum FlowersPowdered air-dried flowers of V. calvum (210 g) were suspended in hexane (1.25 L). The flask wasimmersed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then left at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently,the mixture was decanted and filtered. This process was repeated 3 times; the extracts were combinedPlants 2020, 9, 1066 9 of 19and the solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue (A, 1.78 g, 0.85% w/w)was stored at 4 ◦C, protected from light. Subsequently, the biomass was extracted with MeOH (1 L).The mixture was immersed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then left at room temperature for 1 h;subsequently, the mixture was decanted and filtered. This process was repeated 3 times, each timeusing a fresh amount of solvent (1 L). The extracts were then combined and the solvent was removedby evaporation under vacuum. The resulting residue (B, 35.5 g, 16.9% w/w) was stored in a vial at4 ◦C, protected from light. Finally, the biomass was extracted with 800 mL of a mixture of MeOH/H2O (70:30), following the procedure previously described 3 times. The extracts were then pooledtogether and the methanol was removed by a rotary evaporator; the residual aqueous phase was finallylyophilized to give a crude residue (C, 16.05g, 7.6% w/w) that was stored in a vial at 4 ◦C, protectedfrom light.3.4. Preliminary Phytochemical Analysis of Residues B and CResidues B and C were preliminary analyzed on analytical thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) platesunder two chromatographic conditions: (a) RP-18 plates, eluted with MeOH/H2O (1:1); (b) silica-gel60, eluted with EtOAc/n-BuOH/HCO2H/H2O (5:3:1:1). After drying, the plates were inspected underUV light at 366 nm before and after exposure to NH3 fumes, or under visible light after spraying themwith a FeCl3 solution (2.7 g in 100 mL of 2M HCl), or under visible and UV light after spraying with anAlCl3 solution (1g in 100 mL of EtOH), or with an ethanolic solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH), or with 0.5% vanillin in sulfuric acid/EtOH (4:1), followed by heating at 110 ◦C for about1 min [80]. The colors of the spots indicated the presence of phenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids,and terpenoids. Moreover, the extracts B and C were very similar qualitatively.3.5. Preliminary Chromatographic Purification of Residues B and CTo remove chlorophylls and residual highly lipophilic components, a sample of residue B (1.1 g)was filtered through an SPE C-18 cartridge (Discovery® DSC-18 SPE Tube, bed wt. 10 g, volume 60 mL,Supelco) previously conditioned with MeOH (100 mL), followed by H2O (100 mL). The sample wasdissolved by stirring in MeOH/H2O (90:10) in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h, loaded on the top of thecolumn, and eluted by 200 mL of MeOH/H2O (90:10). The liquid was taken to dryness under vacuum.Subsequently, to remove tannins and other polymeric material, the resulting residue (1.07 g) was filteredwith a flow of 4 mL/min through a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 g, Sigma) that had previously beenswollen in MeOH/H2O (80:20) overnight. The sample was dissolved in 10 mL of MeOH/H2O (80:20) inan ultrasonic bath for 1 h and, after loading on the column, was eluted by equal volumes (250 mL each)of MeOH/H2O (80:20), MeOH/H2O (65:35), MeOH/H2O (50:50), and Me2CO/H2O (70:30) (in this order).The solutions were combined and evaporated to dryness under vacuum to give residue B’ (1.05 g).An analogous procedure was followed to remove possible lipophilic and tannin contaminants from asample (100 mg) of extract C to give residue C’ (90 mg).3.6. Folin–Ciocalteu AssayThe total phenolic contents of the extracts B’ and C’ were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteuassay, according to the method described by Singleton et al. [81]. Ten percent EtOH was the solvent forthe standard and the samples. A calibration line was constructed using gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich)as the standard in the concentration range of 1–5 µg/mL. The equation of the calibration curvewas y = 0.0876(7) x + 0.006(2). Absorbances of tested samples were read at 760 nm, against a blankcontaining 1 mL of 10% EtOH. Analyses were conducted in triplicate. The total phenolic contents insamples B’ and C’, expressed as gallic acid equivalent/100 g extract, were 79.56 (±1.26) g and 74.91(±0.19) g, respectively.Plants 2020, 9, 1066 10 of 193.7. Anti-radical Activity TestThe free radical scavenging (FRS) activity of residues B’ and C’ was’ determined using the2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl stable radical (DPPH, Sigma-Aldrich) method [82]. B’ and C’ wereseparately dissolved in MeOH at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Stock solutions were then serially dilutedwith MeOH, giving test solutions at the final concentrations of 7.6, 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, and 0.3 mg/mL forB’ and 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6, 0.3, and 0.15 mg/mL for C’. Three solutions of ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich),used as the reference standard, were prepared with concentrations of 10, 5.0, and 2.5 mg/mL in MeOH.Test mixtures are prepared by adding 100 µL of each extract (or standard) solution to 3.9 mL of DPPHsolution, freshly prepared dissolving DPPH in methanol/KH2PO4 and NaOH buffer (50/50 v/v) at aconcentration of 6 × 10−5 M (pH 7.4). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark,the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 25 UV/VISspectrometer N.3903, Perkin Elmer instruments, Massachusetts, USA). FRS activity was expressed as apercent compared with the control, that consisted of the DPPH solution (3.9 mL) and MeOH (100 µL).The percent inhibition of the DPPH radical by the tested solution was calculated using the followingformula FRS% = [(Acontrol − Aample)/Acontrol] × 100. The analyses were carried out in triplicate and theresults are expressed as mean ± SD. The concentration of the sample reducing 50% DPPH (EC50) wasdetermined by plotting FRS% against the sample concentration (Figure 11).Plants 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20  3.7. ti-radical ctivity est The f   i g (FRS) activity of residues B’ and C’ was’ determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylh drazyl stable radical (DPPH, Sigma-Aldrich) method [82].

Test mixtures are prepared by adding 100 µL of each extract (or s andard) solution to 3.9 mL of DPPH solution, freshly prepared dissolving DPPH in methanol/KH2PO4 and NaOH buffer (50/50 v/v) at a concentration of 6 × 10−5 M (pH 7.4). After 30 min of incuba ion at room temp rature in the dark, the ab orbance was measured at 515 nm using a UV-Visible spec rophotometer (Lambda 25 UV/VIS spectrometer N.3903, Perkin Elmer instruments, Massachusetts, USA). FRS activity was expressed as a percent compared with the control, that consisted of the DPPH solution (3.9 mL) and M OH (100 µL). The perc nt inhibition of the DPPH radical by the tested solutio  was ca culated using the following formula FRS% = [(Acontrol − Aample)/Acontrol] × 100. The analyses were carried out in trip icate and the results are expressed as mean ± SD. The concentration of the sample reducing 50% DPPH (EC50) was determined by plot ing FRS% against he sample concentration (Figure 11).   (A) (B) Figure 11. Per cent free radical scavenging (FRS%) activity vs. sample concentration (g/mL) curves for extracts B’ (A) and C’ (B) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test. 3.8. Antibacterial Activity Test The antibacterial activities of B’ and C’ against bacteria Staphylococus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococus mutans (ATCC 25175), Staphylococus pyogenes (ATCC 19615), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 10356) were determined as the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), both expressed in µg/mL. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibits the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation, whereas the MBC corresponds to the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that results in bacterial death after sub-culture onto an antibiotic-free medium. Gentamicin was used as the positive control. Each strain was first incubated for 18–20 h in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB; Oxoid LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) at 37 °C. The culture thus obtained was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to separate the cells from the culture medium. The culture medium was removed and the cells were resuspended in IsoSensitest Broth (ISB; Oxoid LTD., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England). Subsequently, the bacterial suspension was appropriately diluted to obtain an absorbance of 0.2 at 655 nm, measured by a spectrophotometer (Jasco-320 Uvidec Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). This absorbance corresponded to a concentration of microorganisms in the range of 1 × 107–1 × 108 CFU /mL. The MIC of each sample was determined by the method of dilution with culture medium [83]. ISB series of tubes containing constantly increasing concentrations of B’ or C’ were inoculated with the same amount of each microbial suspension. After 18–24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the MIC was determined by turbidity and expressed as the percentage volume of the extract used in the assay compared to the total volume (volume of microbial rich medium (mL) + volume antimicrobial agent (mL)) in the tube (% v/v). The MBC values were calculated by inoculating aliquots of culture medium taken from tubes where the MICs had been determined, in test tubes containing extract-free culture Figure 11.

Three replicates were performed for each test. The MICs of B’ and C’ against S. aureus,S. mutans, S. pyogenes, and E. coli were, respectively, >1530 and >1500, 918 and 1050, 612 and 750,>1530 and >1500 µg/mL. The MBCs of B’ and C’ were >1500 µg/mL against all the tested strains.For comparison, the values determined for gentamicin were in the range of 0.25–1 µg/mL.3.9. Antifungal Activity TestThe antimycotic activity of samples B’ and C’ were tested using our collection of fungal strains,namely Candida albicans (Robin) Berkhout, Microsporum canis E. Bodin ex Guég., Aspergillus niger Tiegh.,and Bipolaris oryzae (Breda de Haan) Shoemaker. Fungi were maintained on Sabouraud (SAB) agarmedium (1 L of distilled water, 30 g of glucose, 10 g peptone). Suspensions were prepared from a24-h-old culture in the case of C. albicans and one-week-old cultures in the case of the other strains.The antifungal activities were evaluated by means of the microdilution method in 96-well plates [84,85].After proving that the extracts were soluble, serial dilutions of the extracts were prepared directlyusing the SAB medium inoculated with the tested fungus. The following concentrations were used: 5,2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.06, 0.03, 0.015, 0.007, 0.003 mg/mL. A volume of 50 µL of each dilution wasdistributed in each well. Three replicates were performed for each test and dilution. The inoculatedplates were incubated at 37 ◦C for C. albicans and at 27 ◦C for the other fungi. The MICs (minimuminhibition concentrations) were determined after 24 h in the case of C. albicans and A. niger; for theother microorganisms, the MICs were recorded after 5 days. The MIC values are reported in Table 2.Fluconazole (MIC = 1 µg/mL against C. albicans) was used as the reference antifungal compound.Table 2.

Tumor Cell Viability Test (MTS Assay)The MTS cell proliferation assay protocol is based on the reduction of the MTS[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] yellowtetrazolium compound by NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cellsto a purple formazan salt, that is soluble in cell culture media [86]. The formazan salt has a maximumof absorbance in the UV spectrum at 490 nm. The measure of the absorbance can be directly related tothe number of viable (living) cells.MCF-7 breast (ATCC No. HTB-22) and A549 lung cancer cells (ATCC No. CLL-185) were grownin flasks for several days in an incubator (Forma Scientific) at 37 ◦C under a humidified atmosphereadded of 5% CO2, changing the liquid growth medium (RPMI 1640 (Euroclone, Europe) supplementedwith 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, UK), and 0.005% L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin (LifeTechnologies, Milan, Italy)) whenever needed. When a cell culture reached confluency, a small amountof trypsin was added to the medium in order to separate the cells from the flask; after 3 min ofincubation at 37 ◦C, 1 mL of FBS was added to stop the action of trypsin and avoid cells membranedegradation. The cell-containing medium was then transferred into a cell strainer and centrifuged(ALC 4232 Centrifuge) at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the growthmedium (1 mL), and the cells were separated using an automatic pipette and counted using a countingchamber and trypan blue as dye. After a proper dilution, separated cells were plated in a 96-wellflat-bottom microplates (Cellstar, Greiner bio-one) at a density of 3 × 103 cells in 100 µL of growthmedium in each well. After 2 h of incubation, the growth medium was replaced with 100 µL of testmedium (RPMI 1640 added with 0.005% L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin) and the microplatewas left in the incubator for 24 h. Five test solutions (1 mL each) with concentrations equal to 600, 60, 6,Plants 2020, 9, 1066 12 of 190.6, and 0.06 µg/mL, respectively, were prepared by diluting a stock solution of sample B’ (60 mg/mLMeOH) with the test medium. The test medium in the wells was replaced with a solution (100 µL)of increasing sample concentration. For each sample tested, five replicates were performed for eachdilution. The microplate was then further incubated for 24 h; subsequently, the sample containingmedium was replaced with fresh test medium (100 µL) and 20 µL of MTS tetrazolium reagent (CellTiter96® – AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, USA). After 2 h of incubation,the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a plate reader (BioRAD Model 550 Microplaate Reader).The IC50 (µM) ± S.D values of cisplatin used as the cytotoxic reference compound were 17 (±4) and 13(±2) against MCF-7 and A549 cell lines, respectively. The control was the test medium + 1% MeOH.The percentages of growth inhibition of tumor cells (treated with different concentration of extractB’) compared to the control are shown in Table 3. The graphical results of the antiproliferative activitiesof extract B’ are represented in Supplementary Material.Table 3.

Chromatographic Separation of Residue B’Residue B’(1g) was separated on a medium pressure liquid chromatography using a hand-packedreversed-phase column (LiChroprep RP18, 25–40 mm, 120 g, MerckMillipore). Solvents A and B of themobile phase were H2O and MeOH, respectively. A linear gradient was applied from an A/B mixture(80:20) to 100% B, over 4.8 h at room temperature, at a flow rate of 10 mL/min; dual UV detectionwavelengths set at 215 and 220 nm. The column was eventually washed with 100% MeOH for 3 min toelute strongly adsorbed compounds. Fifty-three fractions (8 mL each) were collected; the solvent in thetubes was evaporated using a centrifuge under vacuum and a liquid nitrogen trap, and the residueswere weighed. The overall recovery of the chromatographed mixture was 95.1%. Then, the contentof each fraction was analyzed by TLC on analytical silica gel 60 (GF254, Merck) plates, eluted withEtOAc/n-BuOH/HCO2H/H2O (5:3:1:1), and on RP-18 (Sigma-Aldrich) plates, eluted with MeOH/H2O(1:1). Spots were detected under UV light at 254 and 366 nm and by spraying the plate with 0.5%vanillin in sulfuric acid/EtOH (4:1) [80], followed by heating at 105 ◦C for about 1 min. Fractions7 (42.8 mg) and 12 (10.8 mg), obtained as colorless powders, were homogeneous and were directlysubmitted to spectroscopic analysis. Comparison with literature data indicated their identity withaucubin (43) [87,88] and ajugol (42) [89], respectively.3.12.

Acidic Hydrolysis of Compounds 42 and 43Compounds 42 and 43 (3.0 mg each) were separately dissolved in 2M HCl in a sealed vial andheated at 100 ◦C for 45 min. After cooling to room temperature and extraction with CHCl3, the aqueouslayer was repeatedly evaporated to dryness with the aid of MeCN. The residue, which showed positiveoptical rotation, was identified as glucose by TLC [90] upon comparison with an authentic sample of(+)-D-glucose.4. Results and DiscussionPowdered air-dried flowers were thoroughly defatted by soaking in hexane at room temperature;successively, the biomass was extracted with MeOH, followed by MeOH/ H2O (70:30). The yieldsof the residues B and C resulting from the evaporation of the two extracts were 16.9 and 7.6% (w/w),respectively. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed a high content of phenols, phenolic acids,flavonoids, and terpenoids. Two samples of extracts B and C were then filtered through an SPEC-18 cartridge to remove minor amounts of chlorophylls and residual lipophilic components and,successively, through a Sephadex LH-20 column to remove tannins and other polymeric material.The two resulting residues, B’ and C’, were obtained in yields of 95 and 97 %, respectively, from B and C.The total phenolic contents (%, w/w) of B’ and C’, estimated in terms of gallic acid equivalent by meansof the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent [81], were 79.56 (± 1.26)% and 74.91 (± 0.19)%, respectively. Samplesof B’ and C’ exhibited no significant antimicrobial activity against the bacteria Staphylococus aureus,Staphylococus mutans, Staphylococus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli, and against the fungi Candida albicans,Microsporum canis, Aspergillus niger, and Bipolaris oryzae. The antiproliferative activity of residue B’against MCF-7 breast and A549 lung cancer cells was estimated by the MTS cell viability assay [86].At the concentration of 600 µg/mL, B’ showed an interesting antiproliferative effects towards the humannon-small cell lung cancer A549 cells; notably, the growth inhibition activity decreased only slightly,namely from 48.43% to 44.95%, when the sample concentration was reduced by one tenth to 60 µg/mL.Moving from antiproliferative to antioxidant properties evaluation, the free radical scavenging effects(FRS) of B’ and C’ were tested by the DPPH assay, given that reactive oxygen species (ROS), includingseveral oxygen radicals, are involved in inflammation processes [91]. Significant dose-dependent FRSactivities were determined for both B’ and C’, with IC50 values of 38.2 and 34.6 mg/mL, respectively.Plants 2020, 9, 1066 14 of 19Moreover, at the dose of 62.5 mg/mL, the two residues quenched over 60% DPPH, compared to 59.5%determined for 60 mg/mL of ascorbic acid.Residue B’ was then separated on a medium pressure liquid chromatographic (MPLC) instrumentusing a hand-packed reversed-phase column. Elution with a gradient of MeOH in H2O led to theisolation of aucubin (43, 42.8 mg) and ajugol (42, 10.8 mg) in the firstly eluted fractions, whereas mostlya mixture of phenolic derivatives (UV and NMR spectra) was contained in the most polar fractions,which were not analysed further. The structures of the two compounds were determined by spectralanalysis. The data (see paragraph 3.1.12) fully corresponded to those reported in the literature [87–89].5. ConclusionsSeveral Verbascum species are used in the traditional medicine of Kurdistan. In the first part ofthis paper, we collected (Table 1) the structures of the main constituents, traditional uses and biologicalactivities reported in the literature for the few Verbascum species growing in Kurdistan that have beeninvestigated so far. The most characteristic secondary metabolites are various phenolic derivativesand iridoids and many exhibited interesting bioactivities. Based on these data, we then investigated,for the first time, the contents of polar extracts of V. calvum flowers, which are used in Kurdistan forpreparing traditional remedies to treat skin burns and inflammations. In standard in vitro assays,a methanol and a hydromethanol extract exhibited weak antimicrobial activities, whereas the methanolextract showed significant antiproliferative effects against an A549 lung cancer cell line. Moreover,both extracts exhibited a significant dose-dependent free radical scavenging action against the DPPHradical, comparable to that of ascorbic acid. In the subsequent MPL separation of the methanol extract,two iridoid glucosides, ajugol (42) and aucubin (43), were isolated. It is interesting to note that theestimated content of aucubin in dried flowers of V. calvum was quite high. In fact, the yield of isolatedaucubin was about 0.72% (w/w); however, the isolation procedure has not been optimized.Aucubin (43) is a low-toxic compound in mice. In addition, an impressive variety ofpharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-algesic, antifibrotic,anti-tumor, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and osteoprotective properties, and the promotion ofdermal wound healing, have been reported for this compound [92–94]. Especially potent are theantioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities determined for aucubin [93]. Due to these biologicalproperties, aucubin is receiving increasing attention by pharmacologists [93]. Concerning the biologicalproperties of ajugol (42), a moderate anti-microbial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and Candidaspp. has been reported [95].In conclusion, the methanol extract of V. calvum flowers has proven to be a rich source ofphenolic compounds and iridoid glycosides. The high anti-radical activity of the extract as well asthe anti-inflammatory properties reported in the literature for aucubin (43), that is one of the maincomponents, validated the use of V. calvum in the traditional medicine of Kurdistan as an herbalanti-inflammatory remedy and for topical application to treat skin wounds and burns.We plan to complete in the future the study of the main compounds isolable from the flowersof V. calvum, especially the flavonoid derivatives, and to investigate the contents of leaves and rootsextracts, that seem to be different from that of the flowers. Moreover, our attention will be focussed onthe preparation of standardized plant extracts and proper pharmaceutical formulations for medicinalapplications, as well as on developing an efficient procedure for the quantitative isolation of thevaluable bioactive iridoid aucubin (43).Supplementary Materials: NMR spectra of aucubin and ajugol, as well as bar-graphs of the antiproliferativeactivity of extract B’, are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1066/s1.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, G.V.; Data curation, M.C.; Investigation, H.I.M.A. and G.G.;Supervision, G.V. and F.H.S.H.; Writing- original draft, Z.M.T.; Writing-review and editing, G.V. and G.G.All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.Funding: This research received no external funding.Plants 2020, 9, 1066 15 of 19Acknowledgments: Authors are grateful to Abdul Hussain Al Khayyat and Abdullah S.
