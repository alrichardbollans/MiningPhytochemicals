Plant Science Today. 2022; 9(4): 881–890. https://doi.org/10.14719/pst.1737 Abstract   A surge in laboratory research into the pharmacological properties of bioac-tive compounds, as well as their potential to cure a wide range of ailments, has resulted in an influx of new herbal medications and extracts onto the international market in recent years. Desmodium  gangeticum (L.), one of the  essential herbs of Indian traditional system of medicines is part of many essential formulations viz. "Dashamoola" and is used to treat various dis-eases. It is a perennial herb, locally known as "Shalparni" (Hindi) in India and also reported in many other tropical countries. This review presents the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical effectiveness of D. gangeticum. Literature was systematically searched through various databases, journals and gray literature through electronic and manual search. Collected data was further critically reviewed and summarized in this paper. It contains many bio-active phytochemicals viz. gangeticoside, leonuriside A, tortoside A, dehydrosoyasaponin, gangetin, gangetinin, desmocarpin, desmodin etc. among them, some have drug likeliness prop-erties. Critical literature analysis revealed that it possessed many pharma-cological activities viz. anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anti- oxidant, cardioprotective, antidiabetic and hepatoprotective anti- bacterial, and anti-amnesic activities. Despite a large number of traditional therapeutic uses, D. gangeticum was evaluated for limited therapeutic efficacy through clini-cal trials and evidence suggested it may have therapeutic benefits on bron-chitis, gout, hypertension. The biochemical and physiological mechanisms involved in the different biological effects exhibited by it need to be investi-gated. The herb should be investigated further, focusing on pharmacody-namic, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Well-designed Randomized Controlled trials (RCTs) should be conducted to support its therapeutic use.

Ethnomedicinal knowledge and natural sources have developed the basis of biomedicine and contribute largely to the commercial drug preparations manufactured today.  Experiments on medicinal plants and their possible properties have drawn attention of many scientists. Con-temporary research in drug development from herbal plants includes a multidimensional approach combining pharmacognostical, phytochemical, pharmacological bio-technology and molecular sciences (3). Many therapeutic agents employed presently for various targets have been discovered through their known ethnomedical use (4). Therefore, it is essential to screen medicinal to provide novel and significant leads against various pharmacologi-cal targets.   Desmodium gangeticum (L.) DC. (Fabaceae), com-monly known as 'Salpan' or 'Shalaparni,' is distributed wildly in several regions in Asia, Africa and Australia (5, 6). D. gangeticum is an erect undershrub, up to 1.2 m tall; the stem is angled, hairy when young, glabrescent on aging. It can be characterized among Desmodium species by lax flowers scattered on peduncles and joints of pods longer than broad (Fig. 1) (7).  It is one of the essential herbs of ethnomedicine that have been used extensively either as a single drug or in combination with other drugs in the traditional system of medicines in India (8). In Ayurveda (Indian traditional system of medicine), it has been reported for various ther-apeutic uses such as in oedema, fever, cough, worm infes-tation, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, vomiting, pain and inflamma-tion (9). It is one of the ingredients of 'Dashamoola' an es-sential herbal formulation of Ayurveda which is widely prescribed for many health ailments (10). Its roots have been used ethnomedicinally as an expectorant for lower respiratory tract infections and as an antitoxin in snakebite and scorpion sting (11, 12).     In the last few decades, D. gangeticum was screened to explore its biochemistry, pharmacological activities and clinical uses through scientific experiments. Findings of such researches supported its traditional uses and established it as potential herbal therapeutics. Many secondary metabolites and bioactive compounds have been reported in plants having various pharmacological activities (13, 14). Attempts have been made to review the researches carried out previously, but gathered data were not comprehensive (15). Thus, the purpose of this review is to provide comprehensive information on the ethnomedic-inal uses, phytochemical profile, pharmacological activi-ties and clinical trials on D. gangeticum, to investigate their therapeutic potential, identify gaps in our current knowledge and assess future research prospects.

Electronic databases such as PubMed, Google scholar, AYUSH Research portal, AYUSHDHARA, J-GATE, Research Gate portals, INFLIBNET, and preprint were searched from inception to June 2021 through a search strategy developed using key search terms. Keywords and terms used in search strategy includ-ed 'Shalaparni,' 'Desmodium gangeticum,' 'preclinical study,' 'Ethno medicine,' 'phytochemical,' 'pharma cologi-cal,' 'experimental' Boolean operator (AND, OR, NOT) was also used to limit or broaden the search wherever re-quired. Ayurveda text books, unpublished dissertations and research were also searched manually.   Published or unpublished researches on ethnomed-icine, phytochemistry, animal experiments, and clinical research carried out on D. gangeticum were included. In-formation was rigorously retrieved, critically analyzed and systematically summarized.   Results   Of 344 citations retrieved through systematic search from different databases, 46 were retrieved in PubMed, 14 in AYUSH Research Portal, 17 in DHARA and Google Scholar yielded 267 citations. Six studies were retrieved through manual search. However, only 49 studies were found rele-vant and hence were selected for review. Total 301 articles viz. duplicates (111), nonrelevant (166) and review (24) articles were excluded. Among 49 included studies, 13 were categorized in ethnobotanical uses, 16 in phyto-chemistry, 16 in pharmacological experiments and 4 in clinical trials (Fig. 2). Ethnomedicinal/traditional uses    D. gangeticum is traditionally used as therapeutics in many different geographical regions. In India, root decoction of Shalaparni is used as a snake bite remedy (16). Root paste also traditionally taken orally as an antidote for snake and scorpion bites in the Dudhi block of District Sonebhadra, Uttar Pradesh, India (17). Its root decoction is utilized in rheumatism with a dose of one spoon in Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, India (18). Aqueous leaf extract is poisonous towards E. coli. In Odisha, India (19). The plant's stem and leaf are used as a diuretic, antitoxic, vomiting and diarrhea as a decoction in the Chandra Prabha Wildlife Sanctuary, Chandauli District, Uttar Pradesh (20). It is uti-lized in fever, vomiting, Vata-Dosha in Raipur District (21). In tribal areas of Adilabad District, Telangana Region, plant roots, bark and leaves are used to treat fever and kidney disorders (22). Inhabitant of eastern Ghats, Andhra Pra-desh, India, its root decoction is traditionally utilized with half cup dose once daily for 2-3 months to alleviate respir-atory disease (23). Paste of its stem bark is externally ap-plied in goiter daily once for 3-4 days by tribes of Chhattis-garh state (24). Tonic "Salampak" prepared from D ganget-icum is employed in gynecological diseases by tribals of Jhalod taluka of Dahod district, Gujarat, India (25). Root is used in premature ejaculation in Bulamogi district, Ugan-da (26). The root is also used for cough and cold in Deo-lapar forest range, Maharastra (27). D. gangeticum  is being utilized in Stomach ache and menstrual ache ethnomedici-nally by the Khasia community people in Moulibazar dis-trict of Bangladesh (28). Phytochemical properties   All parts of the D. gangeticum  have been extensively screened for chemical investigations because of their high medicinal values. Various reports have been published regarding the phytochemical content of D. gangeticum. Phytochemical screening of various extracts indicated the presence of carbohydrates, amino acids, glycosides, pro-teins, alkaloids, saponins, phytosterol, flavonoids, ster-oids, terpenoids, phenolic compounds, reducing sugar, anthraquinone and fixed oils (29-36).        Eighteen compounds were recognized from the root, wherein 7 are acids (58.90%), 3 are phenolic com-pounds (4.1%) and plant sterols (5.12%). Other com-pounds reported were 9,12- Octadecadienoic acid,               n-Hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid and γ-sitosterol. Alkaloids, esters, ethers, alcohols and hydrocarbons are also recognized from it through GC-MS, HPTLC method (37). Minor substances in the GSMS study found were           4 dodecanol, 10 undecenal, 1, 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis (2 methylpropyl) ester, 1, 14 Tetradecanediol and            2 methyl pentanal, as well as N hexadecanoic acid, Oleic acid, 9 Dodecanoic acid methyl ester. The trace elements reported through an atomic absorption spectrophotome-ter were iron, magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium and nickel confirmed (38).  The 2.01% total flavonoid content was reported in an aqueous extract of aerial parts, including Rutin, Querce-tin, Genistein and Daidzein (39). gangeticoside (megastig mane glycoside), a new compound from the aerial part, along with three known compounds- leonuriside A, methyl benzoate 2- O-D-glucopyranoside and tortoside A was re-ported (40).  The aqueous extract of plants root and aerial parts Fig. 2. Study flow chart.   884    VASANI  ET AL https://plantsciencetoday.online contains 0.608 mg/g of quercetin (56). Lauric acid, Lupeol, mixture of sitosterole and stigmasterol gallic acid, salicylic acid, caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, quercetin, chloro-genic acid, rutin and kaempferol were found in the root and aerial parts through HPTLC and MS/MS analysis (41). Twelve alkaloids from different parts of DG comprising various groups viz. carboxylated, decarboxylated trypta-mines, fl-phenethylamines were isolated from the roots,  indole-3-alkylamines and 8-carbolines from stem and leaves (42). Kaempferol 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, rutin, quercetin 7-O-β-D glucopyranoside was reported in aerial parts (43, 44). Antileishmanial compound aminoglucosyl-glycerolipid were also reported (45).  Pharmacological/ Experimental study    Plant was reported for many pharmacological activities (Table 1). Details of pharmacological activities has been described below.  Anti-Inflammatory activity    The anti-inflammatory activity of several extracts of aerial parts of D. gangeticum (aqueous, ethanolic, petroleum, acetone, benzene and chloroform extracts) was evaluated through carrageenan-induced paw edema method on albi-no rats. It reported an aqueous extract of D. gangeticum, at concentration of 100 mg/kg, b.w., p.o. exerted 48.33% inhi-bition of paw edema, followed by ethanolic extract 39.27% inhibition, petroleum extract 38.49% inhibition, acetone 36.94% inhibition, benzene 33.12% inhibition and chloro-form 33.04 % inhibition. Standard reference NSAID demon-strated significant paw edema inhibition of 54.88 % at a 100 mg/kg dose. The aqueous extract of D. gangeticum demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory efficacy in a dose-dependent manner among all extracts (46).

After 6 hrs of treatment, paw oedema was signifi-cantly reduced up to 15.68 %,   24.5 %, 45.09 % and contin-ued for 24 hrs, up to 27.39 %, 35.61 % and 43.83 % at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg doses respectively. Standard reference NSAID showed a 51.95 % reduction after 6 hrs and 46.57 % after 24 hrs. It confirms the dose-dependent effect of the extract (47). Furthermore, the plant's aqueous extract was tested for COX-1 (cyclooxygenase), COX-2 and LOX (lipoxygenase) inhibitory activities to determine a valid mechanism for anti-inflammatory effect. The results of the study indicated that plant extract reduces paw swelling significantly (p<0.0001) when compared to the standard medicine Ibuprofen     (100 mg/kg b.w.). The % inhibitory activity of D. gangeticum AqE against COX-2 (IC50=39. 5 g/ml) was significantly higher than that of COX-1 (IC50=49. 5 g/ml). The plant also showed moderate inhibition of LOX interest (IC50=57.0 g/ml) (48).  Another study on anti-inflammatory activity on albino rats revealed that stand-ard control diclofenac sodium     (10 mg/kg) reduced oede-ma volumes by 30.07 % and 44.95 % and oral administra-tion of D. gangeticum water decoction reduced oedema volumes by 9.80 % and 26.74 %  at the 3rd and 6th hrs re-spectively (49). Cardiotonic effect            The aqueous root extract of D. gangeticum was effective for treating ischemic reperfusion injury at a dose of             50 mg/kg weight in rat hearts. The level of creatinine phos-phokinase in the coronary perforate was lower. Significant improvement in Sarcoplasmic ATPase and mitochondrial enzymes were observed in D. gangeticum treated rat hearts. A structural improvement in the myocardium was also observed in D. gangeticum treated rats. The study revealed aqueous root extract improved cardiac function after ischemia reperfusion injury by mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic ATPase preservation in the myocardium. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and  atomic absorp-tion study of Shalaparni root extract the showed presence of bio-constituents that can activate the release of calcium in cardiac tissue (50).  The mechanism of action of methanol extract of     D. gangeticum root was investigated for the anti-ischemic reperfusion property in an isolated frog heart and rat heart. The findings revealed that methanolic extract exert-ed dose-dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on isolated frog hearts, mimicking acetylcholine-like action. Root extract exhibited a cardio-protective effect in the isolated rat heart model for ischemia reperfu-sion injury and action was similar to acetylcholine (G pro-tein agonist). Thus, root extract showed cardioprotection through negative inotropic and chronotropic effects by activating the G-coupled receptors analogous to the action of acetylcholine (51). Antinociceptive activity      The antinociceptive activity of the ethanolic extract of       D. gangeticum  leaves was evaluated in rats by thermal (Eddy's hot-plate and Tail flick test) and chemical (Acetic acid and Formalin) induced nociceptive actions. Oral ad-ministration of ethanolic extract of DG (50, 100, 200 mg/kg), positive control morphine (5 mg/kg i.p.) and aspirin      (300 mg/kg o.p.) reduced acetic acid-induced writhing by 25.92 %, 55.12 %, 68.13 %, 85.61 % and 72.19 % (P<0.05) respec-tively. In Eddy's hot-plate test, the largest dose of the plant extract increased the latency stage by 37.65% and in the tail-flick test, it increased the latency stage by 28.26% (P <0.05). In formalin-elicited sensitive pain, a     200 mg/kg dose of extract suppresses 29.67% (P <0.05) of neurogenic pain (47). Antioxidant activity     The antioxidant and experimentally induced ischaemic reperfusion effects of aqueous extract of D. gangeticum root were evaluated in an isolated rat heart. Oral admin-istration of extract (50 and 100 mg/kg once daily for thirty days) increased enzymatic activity of superoxide dis-mutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced the lipidperoxidations. The results indicated that the liquid extract of the root has a significant radical scavenging effect (52). Anti-Asthmatic activity    Chloroform, ethanolic and hydro-alcoholic root extracts were evaluated for the anti-asthmatic activity in ovalbu-min-induced Wister rats.WBC count was significantly lower in extract-treated rats than sensitized control (ovalbumin treated) rats in the study. There was also a significant de-crease in Malonyldialdehyde (MDA) levels in the experi-mental rats compared to ovalbumin-treated rats (53).     Antibacterial activity    The antibacterial activity of ethanol, methanol, aqueous and chloroform extract of D. gangeticum was evaluated against bacterial pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoni-ae, E. coli, Streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. mu-tants and S. typhi. Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Kanamycin, Penicillin and Tetracyclin were used in the antibiotic sensi-Renal Protective Ethanolic extract (whole plant) In-vivo Streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats Yasmeen N et al.

The methanolic extract showed the maximum zone of inhibition (24±2.3 mm) against S. mutants, whereas the aqueous extract showed the minimum zone of inhibi-tion (7±0.08) against P. aeruginosa. Antibiotic sensitivity was also found against all microorganisms with tetracy-clin, kanamycin, and ciprofloxacin. The methanolic extract of D. gangeticum had the maximum antibacterial potential among all extracts. The methanolic extract of D. ganget-icum can serve as a potential antibacterial source for vari-ous infections (54). Anti-amnesic activity     An antiamnesic effect of D. gangeticum aqueous extract was assessed at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg was administered orally to young and aged mice for one week. Elevated plus-maze and the fear-aggravated passive avoidance task were used to test learning and remem-brance. Scopolamine (intraperitoneal) produced and age-ing-linked amnesia were served as the interoceptive para-digm. Intraperitoneal piracetam (200 mg/kg) was adminis-teredas standard memory enhancer medicine. Animals treated priorly with aqueous extracts enhanced cognitive function remarkably in both models, scopolamine induced and ageing-linked amnesia. In addition, test drug lowered acetylcholinesterase effect in brain. D. gangeticum ap-pears to be a promising cognitive function enhancer agent (55). Antidiabetic activity     An antidiabetic activity was evaluted wherein diabetic rats were given aerial parts of D. gangeticum extract for three weeks. Blood glucose levels were significantly decreased after 30 min in D. gangeticum-treated rats compared to the control. It was suggested that D. gangeticum might act by direct stimulation of b-cells to secrete insulin (56).   In another antidiabetic study, D. gangeticum aque-ous extract exhibited good alpha glucosidase and DPP-IV (Dipeptidyl peptidase IV) inhibitory activity, with IC50 val-ues of 950 g/ml and 255.5 g/ml respectively (57). Antiulcer study      An antiulcer activity has been evaluated through four gas-tric ulcer models such as cold restraint stress induced, as-pirin induced and ethanol inducedand pyloric ligation in-duced in Sprague Dawley rats; and histamine produced duodenal ulcer paradigmin guinea pigs. Oral administra-tion of plant extract at 200 mg/kg dose remarkably de-creased the occurrence of ulceration among all paradigms. Plant extract provided 68.37 % protection against cold restraint stress, 38.2 % protection against aspirin, 40.63 % against pyloric ligation and 63.15 % protection against histamine induced ulcer models, whereas active compara-tor omeprazole provided protection of 83.86%, 56.35%, 70.31% and 84.21% in respective models. Plant extract reduced gastric juice secretion by 41.61 %, whereas omeprazole reduced it by 43.13%. Plant extract admin-istration increased 56.17 %  in mucin secretion, whereas 12.45 % rise was observed in omeprazole treated group (58).    In another study where in root extract oraly admin-istered remarkably protected the gastric ulcer by reducing size and lesion number in a concentration-depending way at the doses of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg against an ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model in mice. Prior treatment of plant extract also decreased ulcer index in chronic state in Pylorus ligated mice model. At higher concentration (150 mg/kg), the plant extract increased protein and glutathione levels significantly. Moreover, con-centration-dependent significant reduction was observed in gastric secretion, free acidity and total acid output in extract-trated animals suggesting potential of gastropro-tection of plant extract through regeneration of gastric mucosal injury (59).  Renal protective study    Renal protective activity of D. gangeticum was observed along with antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The administration of D. gangeticum etha-nolic extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days lowered levels of renal markers (Blood  Urea  Nitro-gen (BUN), Serum Creatinine and Urea) in dose depending manner, indicating its renal protective potential (60).  Hepatoprotective Activity      The hepatoprotective activity of D. gangeticum against paracetamol in toxicated rats was tested using Wistar albi-no rats. It reduced the serum ALT (Alanine aminotransfer-ase), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), AST (Aspartate ami-notransferase), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase), total protein and bilirubin levels. It showed that D. gangeticum significantly attenuat-ed hepatotoxicity (61).  Antitussive activity    D. gangeticum provided 52.51 % protection against SO2 generated cough reflexes in mice in antitussive efficacy against SO2 induced cough reflexes (62). Anti-histaminic activity      The in vitro anti-histaminic activity was investigated against histamine-induced contraction of isolated guinea pig ile-um. At the dose of histamine (100 ng/ml bath fluid), D. gan-geticum produced 41.33% inhibition of histamine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum (62). In another study on the same model, D. gangeticum produced 41.86% inhibi-tion of histamine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum (43).  Antidiarrheal activity     Antidiarrheal activity against castor oil-induced diarrhea was conducted in Wistar albino rats. A concoction of          D. gangeticum showed significant antidiarrheal activity against castor oil-induced diarrhea in ratscompared to the castor-oil control group (43).  In vitro Mast cell stabilization study   In vitro Mast cell stabilization study, the aqueous and methanolic extract of D. gangeticum exerted the mast cell stabilization effect in a dose-dependent manner against control (compound 40/80) in the isolated mesentery of albino rats (43, 62). 887 Plant Science Today, ISSN 2348-1900 (online) Clinical study     Bronchitis    A randomized, open-labeled, single-centric clinical trial was conducted for evaluating efficacy of D. gangeticum on bronchitis. Arm of patients was treated with 50 ml decoc-tion of D. gangeticum and another with 50 ml decoction of Pseudarthria viscida for 2 weeks. Participants were ran-domly divided into D. gangeticum and P. viscida groups.  D. gangeticum exhibited better effectiveness compared to P. viscida on bronchitis symptoms. However, the difference was not statistically significant. The small sample size, open-labeled study and Ayurvedic drug control were limi-tations. Thus, D. gangeticum needs to be further evaluated in a sufficient sample size with a standard control from a conventional system of medicine to assess the effect on bronchitis (62).  Gout     The effectiveness of D. gangeticum on Vatarakta (gout) was investigated through a randomized, double-blind, single-centric clinical trial. In the trial, total 76 participants were randomized equally in two arms, receiving either      50 ml decoction of D. gangeticum or Flemingia strobilifera for one month. At the end of the trial, symptomatic im-provement was observed in both groups (63). In another randomized, double-blind, single-centric clinical trial, comparing the effect of D. gangeticum and Desmodium laxiflorum on gout (Vatarakta), was conducted (64). Total 66 patients were randomized, wherein 33 were treated with  D. gangeticum decoction and 33 with D. laxiflorum decoction for one month. The outcome was clinical im-provement in the symptoms. At the end of the trial, clinical improvement was observed in both groups. The small sample size and Ayurvedic drug control were limitations of both trials. Thus, further study on D. gangeticum is needed with a sufficient sample size and having appropriate con-trol to assess its effect on gout. Hypertension     The effect of the drug on hypertension was also assessed by randomized control trial. Patients were randomly divid-ed into two groups (30 each group). One group of patients were treated with active control Telmisartan-20 mg or      40 mg per day, and another group of patients with Shala-parni Ksheerapaka (D. gangeticum processed with milk), 150 ml twice a day for 45 days. The active control Telmisar-tan reduced blood pressure better compared to it. Howev-er, D. gangeticum improved the hypertension symptoms and the cholesterol level. The sample size was small which compelled further clinical evaluation (65).   Discussion  D. gangeticum is believed to be native to India and also found in tropical Africa and Australia. Other than that, it has also been famously used as medicinal herbs, mainly as an ingredient of Dashamoola formulation in Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicines since ancient times. Its documented therapeutic uses recorded in Ayurvedic texts are oedema, fever, cough, worm infestation, dysp-noea, diarrhoea, vomiting, pain and inflammation. Other than that, it is also used therapeutically in various ways by many ethnic groups for snake bites, diuretic, antitoxic, goiter, gynecological diseases, premature ejaculation, cold, abdominal pain and menstrual ache. Many of these claims have been evaluated experimentally via in vitro and in vivo techniques of biological evaluation and confirmed its bio-activities.  Due to high medicinal values, its root, stem and leaves have been evaluated extensively through phyto-chemical investigations and revealed many bio-active phy-tochemical contents, viz. Gangeticoside, Leonuriside A, Methyl benzoate 2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, Tortoside A, Dehydrosoyasaponin, gangetin, gangetinin, desmocarpin, desmodin etc. Further, phytochemical and in-silico study assessing ADME properties of selected pterocarpan of       D. gangeticum viz. gangetin, gangetinin, desmocarpin and desmodin revealed drug-likeliness of molecules (66). It may lead to further exploration of these molecules for effective drug development. There is still a lot of confusion about the pharmacological effects of plants that are influ-enced by their known or unknown compounds. Thus, structure-guided isolation and identification of the bioac-tive components are needed to understand these active compounds' structure-activity relationship.  Experiment on animal models suggested D. ganget-icum can be confirmed to possess anti-inflammatory, an-tinociceptive, antiamnesic, antidiabetic, antiulcer, anti-bacterial, antidiarrheal and antioxidant, antitussive, anti-histaminic, hepatoprotective, renal protective and cardio-protective activities. However, the biochemical mecha-nisms of D. gangeticum on the human body remain largely unexplored. Various bio-activities of D. gangeticum may be attributed to multiple compounds rather than a single molecule. D. gangeticum containing multi-components may produce multi-target activities that are difficult to detect by the present pharmacological one-target, one-drug approach. A new approach is required to understand multi-component effects of traditional medicine's effects. Network pharmacology, a novel approach in systems biol-ogy, may satisfy the need for herbal medicines and effec-tively explore the mechanism of the biochemical pathway for multi-components herbs (67, 68).  Presently, natural source is its only source. As          D. gangeticum is a high-demand herb of Ayurveda, its  root is being collected from natural source. It may lead to its scarcity and adulteration in the market for commercial purposes. Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India also recom-mended the whole plant alternate to the root (69). An effort has also been made to find alternate sources for the root. Aerial parts and other closely related Desmodium species were evaluated for alternate sources through in-sufficient preliminary investigations (70, 71). However, further experiments were highly warranted to confirm the alternate source. Adulteration is a considerable concern for traditional medicines due to the lack of an effective quality control system that provides genuine and high-quality herbs for therapeutic use. The scientific and relia-ble quality assurance system complying with the charac-teristics of traditional medicine is yet to be entirely con- 888    VASANI  ET AL https://plantsciencetoday.online structed.   Considering traditional Ayurvedic uses and prelimi-nary animal experiments, few clinical trials were conduct-ed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of D. gangeticum on various diseases, viz. hypertension, bronchitis and gout, and showed a trend towards benefits. However, its find-ings are uncertain as all trials had a small sample size and concern of bias. Well-designed randomized clinical trials are warranted to prove the therapeutic benefits of the spe-cies.   Conclusion   Desmodium gangeticum has been used in Ayurvedic medi-cine for centuries. The thorough literature  review revealed that it is an essential source of medicinally important com-pounds such as gangetin, gangetinin, desmocarpin and desmodin.The plant has also been widely studied for its various pharmacological activities like anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antioxidant, cardioprotective, antidiabet-ic, hepatoprotective, antibacterial and antiamnesic activi-ties. It was also evaluated clinically in bronchitis, gout, hypertension for possible therapeutic benefits through clinical trials. Despite the positive results of the review, there are some limitations observed in the present litera-ture on the use of the plant as a multi-purpose therapeutic agent. The biochemical and physiological mechanisms involved in the different biological effects exhibited by      D. gangeticum need to be investigated. Further research is required focusing pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles to validate its efficacy reported through preliminary animal experimentations. Moreover, well-designed RCTs should be conducted to support its thera-peutic use.
