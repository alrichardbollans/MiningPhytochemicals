Abstract
The use of chemical defensives to control fungal diseases has by consequence to impact negatively over the environment 
and human health, this way, the use of plant extracts with antifungal properties along with proper cultural management 
makes viable an alternative plant production control, specially for familiar and organic cultures. The objective of 
this study was to perform phytochemical and antioxidant analysis of Byrsonima crassifolia (canjiqueira) barks and 
evaluate its antifungal potential over Fusarium solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum mycelial growth. The ethanol 
extract from plants collected in Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil was submitted to phytochemical prospection, 
total phenol and flavonoids quantification and antioxidant activiy determination (DPPH). To evaluate antifungal activity 
concentrations of 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 and 2400 µg 100 mL-1 of ethanol extract were used. Which concentration was 
separately incorporated in agar (PDA) and shed in Petri dishes, followed by the fungi mycelial disc where the colonies 
diameter was measured daily. Negatives control with agar without extract and agar with an ethanol solution were 
used. The B. crassifolia ethanol extract presented inhibitory activity over the fungi studied where concentrations of 
800 and 1600 µg 100 mL-1, inhibited 38% of the mycelial growth of F. solani; to S. sclerotiorum the best concentration 
was 2400 µg 100 mL1, reducing 37.5%. The antifungal bark extract potential of this specie is attributed to phenolic 
compounds and to triterpenes derivatives.

ambiente e a saúde humana, dessa forma, a utilização de extratos vegetais com propriedades antifúngicas associado 
ao manejo adequado de culturas, torna-se uma proposta viável de controle alternativo, principalmente na agricultura 
orgânica e familiar. Neste sentido, objetivou-se neste trabalho realizar a análise fitoquímica e antioxidante das cascas 
de Byrsonima crassifolia (canjiqueira) e avaliar seu potencial antifúngico sobre o crescimento micelial de Fusarium

Antifungal activity of Byrsonima crassifolia
1. Introduction
Phytopathogenic fungi affect different crops, being 
responsible for economic losses in agricultural production. 
Among these disease-causing organisms highlights the 
ones that are found in soil, considered a difficult control 
problem, since they produce resistance structures and 
can survive for several years, such as Fusarium solani 
(Mart.) Sacc and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) from 
Bary (Bueno et al., 2007).
Different kinds of chemical products are used to 
control these fungi, however their incorrect application 
may lead to several impacts on natural resources and in 
human health, another potential effect is the selection of 
resistant pathogens to agrotoxics (Celoto et al., 2008).
Utilizing natural products to control plant diseases is 
becoming a promising alternative to reduce using agrotoxics 
(Zacaroni et al., 2009). Celoto et al. (2008) pointed that 
vegetal extracts have antifungal potential and may be used 
as a model to synthesise new fungicides or be directly 
applied by the producer.
This way, the use of vegetal extracts to control or 
inhibit phytopathogens represents a viable alternative 
for organic and family farmers, once the measures used 
by great farmers to control those agents, using massive 
quantities of chemicals, do not match small producers 
reality (Silva et al., 2009).
Family farmers in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, 
Brazil, contributes to develop local agribusiness, mainly 
providing supply for families, reducing rural flight and 
generating work and income (Sangalli and Schlindwein, 
2013). Beyond that, family farmers use more environmentally 
balanced practices, contributing to culture diversification 
and reducing the use of industrial inputs (Padua et al., 
2013). This way, plants prospect ion becomes relevant to 
the growth of family farm in the State, according to the 
agricultural Census held in 2006, this activity answer for 
65% of the properties, producing beans, corn, soy, wheat 
and other crops (IBGE, 2009). The great biodiversity 
found in the region is related to biome Cerrado and also 
the presence of Pantanal, a wetland. These formations 
represents a wealth biodiversity of vegetal species, lot of 
them are well known and used medicinally (Oliveira et al., 
2011), with potential to be investigated as their insecticide, 
bactericide and fungicide activities, which can point their 
future use in sustainable farming practices.
Among these species of interest, there is Byrsonima 
crassifolia (L.) Kunth (Malpiguiaceae), a shrub found in 
Brazilian north and northeast coast (Pereira and Freitas, 
2002). In Pantanal this specie is commonly called 
“canjiqueira” and occurs mainly on forest edges called 
“capões”, besides it is also found in open fields (Pott and 
Pott, 1994; Pott et al., 2011). Their leaves and bark are 
used medicinally and one of its biological activities is an 
antimicrobial effect (Martínez-Vázquez et al., 1999) and 
bactericide and fungicide activities against several human 
pathogens (Guilhon-Simplicio and Pereira, 2011).
Considering its biological action variety, it becomes 
relevant to investigate its antifungal potential, controlling 
common agricultural phytopathogens which promote crops 
and financial loss specially for family farmers. This way, 
the aim of this study is to realize phytochemistry and 
antioxidant analysis of the Byrsonima crassifolia barks 
and evaluate its antifungal potential over the mycelial 
growth of Fusarium solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
2. Material and Methods
The barks of Byrsonima crassifolia were collected 
from 15 plants at the Rio Negro sub-region of Pantanal 
(19°30’18”S; 55°36’45”W), Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. 
The gathering occurred using a stainless chisel; after that a 
thick layer of petrolatum was applied on the affected area to 
avoid possible pathogens attack. The botanic material was 
conditioned in paper bags and transported to the laboratory. 
Specimens samples were deposited in the Herbarium of 
the Institution under the voucher number 07515.
2.1. Phytochemical analysis
The material was cleaned, dried in circulating air oven 
at 40°C (MARCONI, MA35), and finely ground in a 
Wiley mill (MARCONI, MA048). The powder (500g) 
was extracted with ethanol (99.5%) in ultrasound bath 
(ultrasonic Cleaner) for 60 minutes, followed by extraction 
by maceration during 7 days. The resultant solution was 
filtered and the solvent was evaporated, obtaining the 
ethanol extract, which was subjected to chemical analysis.
The phytochemical prospection occurred through 
characterization reactions, evaluating the presence of 
phenolic compounds, tannins, flavonoids, free coumarins, 
anthocyanins, anthraquinone, steroids, triterpenes, alkaloids, 
saponins, cardiotonic glycosides, cyanogenic heterosides 
and reducing sugar, all analyzes were performed in triplicate 
following methodology adapted by Matos (2009). For results 
of the assays were observed the alterations in the color and/or 
precipitation when compared with control, following the 
method of Fontoura et al. (2015), being strongly positive 
(+++), moderadately positive (++), weakly positive (+) 
and parcialy positive (±), but whether only haze and / or 
partially changed color also the absence of color and / or 
precipitation it was considerate as negative (-). The intensity 
of color and / or precipitation indicates the increased 
concentration of such class of secondary metabolite. 
Extracts were submitted to Bial, Seliwanoff, Barfoed and 
Iodine tests for sugars classification (Remião et al., 2003).
To confirm major components, 400µm mL-1 of the 
extract was analysed through scanning spectrophotometer 
(FEMTO, Modelo 432). Samples absorption aspects 
were measured from the 200 nm to 750 nm region using 
quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany), with three 
repetitions (Silverstein et al., 2014).
The extract was also submitted to pH analysis (DM-20, 
Digimed), concentration of soluble solids was determined 
by means of digital refractometer (45 RTD-refractómetro), 
being the results expressed in °Brix, corrected for 20 °C.

2.2. Total phenol and flavonoids classification
Ethanol extracts (100 mg each) were used to quantify 
total phenol (TP) by the Folin-Ciocalteu method using 
gallic acid (SAE10 to 350 mg mL-1) as standard, a 
(y = 0.781 x – 0.0031; R2 = 0.9959) calibration curve was 
used (Sousa et al., 2007). Flavonoids quantification was 
performed based on aluminum chloride methodology with 
a standard quercetin (y= 0.132 x + 0.0353 R2 = 0.9949) 
(Peixoto Sobrinho et al., 2008).
The experimental design of the two quantification has 
three replicates for each concentration and calculation of 
averages was accompanied by the standard deviation.
2.3. Antioxidant activity
DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) analysis was 
used to determine free radical scavenging activity, where 
2 mL of a DPPH methanol solution (24 mg 100 mL-1 de 
metanol) was added to concentrations of 250, 200, 150, 
100, 50 and 25 mg mL-1 of ethanol extract. After 30 minutes 
resting, the samples absorbance were determined by a 
spectrophotometer UV-VIS, at 515 nm. As negative control 
was used a DPPH in methanol and rutin (Merck) at the 
same concentrations used on samples as a positive control. 
The DPPH antioxidant activity percentage remaining on 
reaction medium (%AA) was calculated using the Equation 1:
( 0 - )%   1 00
0
A AAA
A
= ×   (1)
where A0 is the DPPH absorbance (negative control) and A 
is the samples absorbance with DPPH (Sousa et al., 2007). 
The effective concentration (EC50) was obtained by linear 
regression.
2.4. Antifungal activity
A stock solution was prepared containing 0.2 g of 
ethanol extract from the B. crassifolia barks in 100 mL 
of ethanol (99.5%). From this solution quotes with 
0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 mL were separated into PDA 
(Potato-Dextrose-Agar) cultural medium fondant, until 
reach a volume of 100 mL, where concentrations of 800, 
1200, 1600, 2000 and 2400 µg 100 mL-1 were obtained. 
Two solutions were prepared as control, one containing 
ethanol content (99.5%) added to PDA medium (2400 µg 
100 mL-1), named ethanol solution and another one only 
with PDA medium (without B. crassifolia extract), called 
control.
Four repetition of each concentration were poured 
into Petri dishes of 90 mm in a volume corresponding to 
10 mL per plate. After solidification it was peaked in the 
center of each plate, a mycelium disc with 5 mm diameter 
previously transplanted one week before the procedure. 
Later, the plates were covered and sealed with plastic film 
and kept in growth chamber at 25 °C, with a 12 hours 
photoperiod.
The mycelial growth evaluation was realized through 
daily measurements of the colonies diameter, obtained by 
the average of two diametrically opposed measurements, 
realized until the control group reached the edge of the 
Petri plate.
Based on the obtained data, the growth inhibition 
percentage (GIP) was calculated using the Equation 2:

Data were submitted through variance and regression 
analysis using the software SISVAR (Ferreira, 2011).
3. Results and Discussion
Phytochemical analysis of the ethanol extracts from B. 
crassifolia indicated the presence of phenolic compounds 
(+++), tannins (+++), flavonoids (+++), anthraquinones 
(++), triterpenes (+++), cardiotonic glycosides (+++) and 
reducing sugars (++) (Figure 1).
The results were confirmed by means of spectrophotometers 
analysis at the UV-visible region, were the maximum 
absorption band is 230 nm (λmáx.MeOH) corresponds to 
triterpenes, the bands in 280 and 330 nm (λmáx.MeOH) are 
for phenolic compounds and flavonoids, the band in 280 nm 
corresponds to the A ring absorption (hemiacetal) and the

band in 370 nm represents the flavonoids B ring (Figure 2). 
The presence of anthraquinones was also confirmed due the 
absorption band in 480 nm (λmáx.MeOH); bands between 
481 and 508 nm are characteristical of condensed aromatic 
compounds, which have elevated conjugation level with the 
carboxil group and carboxilic anthraquinones (Figure 2) 
(Silverstein et al., 2014).
The flavonoids and triterpenes positives results agreed 
with the data found by Guilhon-Simplicio and Pereira 
(2011), which pointed the presence of flavonoids and 
terpenes, especially triterpenes for species of the Byrsonima 
genre. In relation to barks of B. crassifolia the presence 
of phenolic compounds, flavonoids and catechins was 
already described by Geiss et al. (1995).
Total phenols and flavonoids quantification in barks 
presented values of 202.5 ± 0.34 (mg g-1 galic acid) and 
178.9 ± 0.85 (mg g-1quercetin), respectively. This demonstrates 
that among the total phenols presented in barks, great part 
of these belong to the flavonoid group. Studying barks of 
B. crassifolia, Silva and Rogez (2013), found similar value 
to the one observed in this paper (208.1 ± 9.7 mg g-1) 
and superior to the one found by Pompeu et al. (2012) 
that was 58.1 mg g-1 of total phenols for the hydroethanol 
crude extract of dried leaves of B. crassifolia collected at 
the region of Belem, PA, Brazil. For the crude extract of 
aerial parts of B. gardneriana, the values were superiors 
(425.105 ± 8.523 mg EAG g-1) (Rolim et al., 2013), which 
suggests that Byrsonima species have high levels of total 
phenols in their composition. Still, differences found in 
several studies with B. crassifolia, may be associated to 
the solvent and the extraction method used (Simões et al., 
2010), just like geographic localization and environmental 
factors form the region where plants are collected may 
influence the presence and intensity of secondary metabolites 
(Gobbo-Neto and Lopes, 2007).
Regarding the antioxidant activity, the efficient 
concentration of ethanol extract of B. crassifolia used to 
decrease the initial concentration of DPPH in 50% was 
2.88 ± 0.15 mg mL-1 and the rutine (positive control) 
presented CE50 of 2.75 ± 0.08 mg mL-1. These results 
point that the extract have antioxidant activity, justified 
by the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids, 
known by their capacity to redeem free radicals and inhibit 
possible oxidant damages. The same antioxidant activity 
of hidro ethanolic extract of Bysonima crassifolia leaves 
was previously described by (Pompeu et al., 2012) and for 
others species of the same genre by (Rolim et al., 2013).
In relation to the antifungal activity, there was observed 
interaction among the different concentrations of ethanol 
extract of B. crassifolia and plant pathogens (F. solani and 
S. sclerotiorum), all concentrations proportioned different 
fungi micelial growth inhibition levels, with the GIP varying 
among 5 and 38% (Figure 3).
Extract concentrations of 800 and 1600µg 100 mL-1 
reduced over 38% of F. solani growth when compared 
to the control group, this affirmation is corroborated by 
regression analysis (Figure 4). Using a 20% concentration 
of Indian clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), Venturoso et al. 
(2011) observed a high inhibition of F. solani, indicating 
that this pathogen may be controlled by plant extracts.
Others vegetal extracts also indicated inhibitory activity 
over others Fusarium genre fungi, like F. oxysporum, 
which had its mycelial growth reduced when using ethanol 
extract of fedegoso (Senna alata L.) (Medeiros et al., 
2012) and F. proliferatum over garlic ethanol extract 
(Allium sativum L.) (Souza et al., 2007).
Treatments with 2000 and 2400 µg 100 mL1 promoted 
significant reduction over S. sclerotiorum growth, with

a inhibitory effect of 19 and 37.5%, respectively, over 
control group (Figure 5).
Those in vivo tests as well as their phitochemical 
analysis allows to evaluate some mechanism evolved in 
the control of micro-organisms that are plant pathogenic, 
whose in many times can remain alive in in vivo conditions 
as related by Rodrigues et al. (2007), using ginger 
(Zingiber officinalis Roscoe) crude extract applied to lettuce 
leaves, reducing mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum in 93%,
There are few studies using B. crassifolia extracts in 
plant pathogens, however Guilhon-Simplicio and Pereira 
(2011) pointed antifungal properties of the bark, leaves, 
flowers, fruits and roots of this specie in several pathogens 
that affect human health.
Naruzawa and Papa (2011) observed that the hydro 
ethanol extract from barks of B. verbascifolia Rich ex. 
Juss had antifungal activity, affecting mycelial growth and 
spore germination of Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. and 
Curt.) Wei and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) 
Sacc., in barbados cherry plants, which highlights the 
secondary metabolite antimicrobial activity of Byrsonima 
genre plants.
Several secondary metabolites from B. crassifolia 
ethanol extract plays significant role in mechanisms that 
activate plants defence, such as triterpenes, flavonoids, 
phenolic compounds and tannins.
According to Agrios (2005) phenolic compounds and 
tannins are pointed as responsible by young plant tissues 
resistance to plant pathogens, being powerful inhibitors of 
several hydrolytical enzymes produced by those pathogens 
during their penetration in plants cells and tissues.
On the same way, flavonoids also actuate as elicitors 
and/or defense chemical mechanisms against virus, bacteria 
and fungi, (Zuanazzi and Montanha, 2004). Their fungi 
toxicity depends on the amount of methylated groups and 
the number of substituents on the aromatics ring formation, 
which makes them more toxic, interfering on fungi membranes 
(Harborne, 1994). By the other side, it’s observed that 
extracts from barks of B. crassifolia have predominance 
of polyphenols and derivates (flavonoids, tannins and 
anthraquinones). These groups have in their structure the 
carboxyl group (OH), which has the ability to link with 
microorganisms enzyme receptors, inhibiting protein 
synthesis. These informations are not well established; 
however, Cushnie and Lamb (2005) pointed that flavonoids 
favor pathogens metabolic modifications, acting inhibiting 
nucleic acid synthesis during cytoplasmatic membrane 
formation and energetic metabolism.
Anthraquinones present condensed aromatic groups 
(lipophilic), carboxyl groups and carboxylics, which 
can act breaking the membrane and inhibit metabolism. 
Many activities are attributed to anthraquinones found 
in nature specially their oxidant potential which triggers 
cellular apoptosis; this effect occurs by intercalation among 
vicinal nucleotides from DNA, by ionic and Van der Waals 
interactions with anthraquinones, blocking polymerases 
and interfering on protein synthesis (Silva et al., 2003; 
Jampilek, 2016).
Triterpenes have a basic lipofilic squeleton, which 
makes easier to break the cells walls, facilitating the 
flow of constituents as well as cardiotonic glycosides to 
the extract, both of them act the same way because these 
cardiotonic glycosides have a triterpenic nature, making 
easier to break the cellular membrane and with their polar 
part inside the cell, they act disabling fungi aminoacids 
residual receptors.
The biological activity of these constituents corroborates 
Schwan-Estrada et al. (2000) studies, which pointed that 
plant extract potentials to control plant pathogens in essays 
is related not only due their toxic action over mycelium and 
spore germination in fungi but also by inducting substances 
involved on plant defence mechanisms.
This study observed a 4% sugars presence on B. 
crassifolia, extracts, obtained by °Brix, to classify sugar 
kinds the extract was submitted to a lugol reaction, 
presenting negative result, indicating the presence of 
mono and disaccharides, from Barfoed and Seliwanoff 
reactions was possible to determine that the extract had 
mainly monosaccharides and ketohexoses. Monosacharides 
are a carbon source to fungi, a major component to their 
growth and sporulation, once their related to their nutrition 
process (Sangeetha and Rawal, 2008). This way, despite 
Braz. J. Biol.2018,  vol. 78, no. 1, pp.140-146 145/146   145
Antifungal activity of Byrsonima crassifolia
the presence of free sugar in extract, which benefits fungal 
growth mechanisms, it was observed the inhibition of the 
plant pathogens F. solani e S. sclerotiorum. It is imperative 
to highlight the importance of sugar evaluations in plant 
extracts to ensure their antifungal action.
A point to be taken in account is the B. crassifolia 
extract pH, which in this study was 4.24 ± 0.09, indicating 
an acidity factor. However, knowing that soils with acid pH 
favor plant pathogens development, this achieved to reduce 
mycelial growth of the fungi studied, which proves their 
antifungal activity, factor related to secondary metabolites 
presented on B. crassifolia barks ant their potential to 
be used as a pathogen control of plants in familiar and 
organic agriculture
Considering that the fungi tested are difficult to 
control because they form colonies that remaining viable 
on soil for a long period, the result obtained in this study 
is considered satisfactory. Being able to suggest that the 
extract presents potential to be used as an alternative 
way to control fungi plant pathogens, leading to reduce 
negative impacts on environment and human health caused 
by using of agro-toxics.
4. Conclusion
B. crassifolia extracts proportioned the inhibition of 
mycelial growth on fungi studied. The antifungal potential 
is probably related to the plant chemical constitution, 
which have a massive amount of secondary metabolites, 
such as flavonoids, phenolic compounds, tannins and 
anthraquinones, and triterpenes, which has an antioxidant 
activity, that are related to plant defense systems against 
other organisms.
