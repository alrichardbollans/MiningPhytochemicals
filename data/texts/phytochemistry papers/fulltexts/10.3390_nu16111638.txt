In this context, P. 20 lentiscus demonstrated several in vitro and in vivo antidiabetic effects, acting upon many therapeutic 21 T2D targets. Therefore, the information available in this review highlighted the multitarget effects 22 of P.lentiscus and its great potential in T2D treatment. 23 Keywords: Pistacia lentiscus; Chios mastic gum; diabetes; therapeutic target; hypoglycaemic effect; 24 hypolipidemic effect 25  26 1. Introduction 27 Pistacia lentiscus L. is an evergreen shrub belonging to the Anacardiaceae family, 28 mainly distributed in Mediterranean region. It is commonly used in traditional medicine 29 for treatment of several diseases including diabetes [1–3]. This plant is also known as 30 lentisk or mastic tree. The latter name derives from the presence of an aromatic resin 31 (mastic) which can be obtained from P. lentiscus trunk and branches. Chios mastic gum is 32 exclusively produced by the mastic tree grown on the Greek island of Chios, a situated in 33 the northern Aegean Sea. Many of its beneficial properties and uses had already been 34 attributed in the antiquity [4], and in 2015 it was recognized by the European Medicines 35 Agency (EMA) as an herbal medicinal product with therapeutical indication for mild 36 dyspeptic disorders and skin inflammation as well as healing of minor wounds [5,6] 37 Over the last years, mastic gum has been used as a spice in food industry, as a food in- 38 gredient and one of the main uses is to produce a natural chewing gum. The therapeutic 39 potential of mastic gum in medicinal field has also been described. Anti-inflammatory 40 action has been reported probably being performed via the inhibition of 41 pro-inflammatory substances production. Moreover, antioxidant, anti-atherogenic, an- 42 ticancer, and antibacterial properties have been reported [6]. Because of the resin’s 43 chemical complexity, it’s difficult to understand which bioactive compounds are re- 44 sponsible for these activities, even if some of them were attributed to triterpenes and 45 volatile compounds[5]. The other parts of the plant were extensively investigated and 46 Citation:To be added by editorial staff during production.

Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 29   also resulted in high content of bioactive compounds as phenolic or flavonoids showing 47 several biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and an- 48 timutagenic activities [3,7]. 49 In this contest, the present review aims to summarize and focus on the antidiabetic 50 activity of Pistacia lentiscus highlighting the great potential of this plant for diabetes 51 treatment.  52 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a progressive metabolic disease characterized by abnor- 53 mal blood glucose levels[8]. Diabetes is becoming more common worldwide as a result of 54 unhealthy lifestyle choices, and by 2030, there will be 578 million cases of the disease[9]. 55 Furthermore, the incidence of diabetes should be regarded as significantly higher, since 56 45% of individuals have undiagnosed diabetes.  57 Pancreatic β-cells secrete the peptide hormone insulin, which is essential for con- 58 trolling blood glucose levels and energy metabolism. Numerous cellular processes, in- 59 cluding the uptake and transport of glucose, the synthesis of glycogen, the synthesis of 60 fatty acids, and the synthesis of proteins, depend on it. Hyperglycemia eventually results 61 from impaired normal glucose homeostasis caused by either insufficient insulin produc- 62 tion or insulin resistance [10]. Chronic hyperglycemia has been linked to major long-term 63 consequences such as kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and nerve damage [11].  64 Diabetes could be divided into type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The most prevalent metabolic 65 diseases affecting children is type 1 diabetes (T1D), sometimes referred as insu- 66 lin-dependent diabetes [12]. Pancreatic β-cells are destroyed by the immune system 67 through T-cell mediation in the pathophysiology of T1D. This ultimately causes the body 68 to secrete less insulin, which causes the beginning of the disease [13].  69 Instead, type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for 90–95% of all instances of the disease and 70 it represents the most common type [14]. Insulin resistance and decreased insulin pro- 71 duction work together to create this type of diabetes[15]. The failure of skeletal muscle 72 cells to absorb glucose and the increased synthesis of glucose in the liver are two exam- 73 ples of how the target tissues are insensitive to insulin [16]. Obesity, physical inactivity, 74 and vitamin D insufficiency are the main risk factors linked to the development of T2D 75 [17].  76 Insulin injections are commonly used as a form of treatment for T1D, while oral 77 drugs in conjunction with lifestyle modifications are utilized to manage T2D [18]. 78 Non-insulin medications obstruct the absorption of glucose, reduce hepatic gluconeo- 79 genesis, and prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose. α-Glucosidase inhibitors, 80 metformin, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors are a few examples of popu- 81 lar anti-diabetic medications that support the above-mentioned effects [19]. However, 82 even though these medications have a significant role in lowering blood glucose levels, 83 side effects are unavoidable.  84 The plant kingdom is attracting increasing interest in finding new bioactive com- 85 pounds for the development of drugs, also due to the intrinsic complexity of natural 86 compounds [20]. Over 800 plants have been reported to possess antidiabetic properties, 87 showing less side effect if compared with synthetic drugs and different bioactive com- 88 pounds with different biological activities have been described [21–24]. 89 P. lentiscus showed to possess several in vitro and in vivo antidiabetic properties, ex- 90 erting activities toward different therapeutic T2D targets. Here, chemical composition of 91 different parts of the plant together with P. lentiscus biological activities are summarized 92 and described. 93 2. Chemical constituents 94 From the literature review, a total of 180 compounds were identified in Pistacia len- 95 tiscus, including essential oil constituents, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, triterpe- 96 noids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, fatty acids, steroids, tannins, and miscellaneous 97 compounds. Phytochemicals were isolated from various parts of the plants, including 98 leaves, fruits, resin, aerial parts, barks. According to the literature, the most common 99 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 29   methods used to identify phytochemicals from the genus Pistacia, notably from its es- 100 sential oils, were high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the gas chro- 101 matography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). These techniques allowed to obtain qualitative 102 and quantitative information on the biochemical constitution of Pistacia lentiscus. Terpe- 103 noids constitute the major chemical group comprising approximately the 54% of the total 104 chemical constituents following by phenolic and flavonoids compounds (13-15%), fatty 105 acids, steroids, tannins (2-5%) and several miscellaneous compounds (5%) (Figure 1). 106 Another category is the volatile compounds included in the essential oil and mastic wa- 107 ter, two products obtained after the distillation process of mastic gum. 108  109  110 Figure 1. Chemical composition of Pistacia Lentiscus 111 Several phenolic acids were detected, among which gallic acid (107) was recovered 112 by several authors [1,25–28]. Quinic acid derivatives and galloyl derivatives such as 113 3,5-O-digalloyl quinic acid (163), 3-galloyl quinic acid (165) and 3,4,5-tri-O-galloyl quinic 114 acid (164), 5-galloyl quinic acid (166) and 1,5-digalloyl quinic acid (170) were detected 115 [1,26].   116 Further studies also reported the presence of vanillic acid (108) [27], p-coumaric acid 117 (113) [27], trans-cinnamic acid (112) [25], caffeic acid (114) [25,27], ferulic acid (115) [29] 118 and tannic acid (169) [25]. Flavonol glycosides were found to be the most abundant class 119 of flavonoids in the leaves and fruits of Pistacia lentiscus. Myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside (135) 120 [1,26] was the predominant flavonol glycoside followed by myricetin-3-O-glucoside (134) 121 [1,26] and quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (136)[1,28]. Myricetin derivatives account for 20% 122 of the total amount of polyphenols in P. lentiscus leaves [1]. Luteolin (122) and apigenin 123 (126), belonging to the class of flavones, were observed in high concentration in both 124 leaves and fruit extracts [1,28]. Mehenni et al. [28] found luteolin to be the second most 125 abundant polyphenol in fruit. Flavonoid namely, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (132) and 126 cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside (133) were identified in berries and leaves [1].  127 Variable levels of total phenolic contents, flavonoids, and condensed tannins were 128 found in all parts of P. lentiscus. The concentration of secondary metabolites changes 129 significantly according to geographical origin, phenological stages, parts of plant used, 130 cultivation sites, extraction solvents used. Recent phytochemical analyses have shown 131 that all the parts (leaf, stem, fruit, and root) of P. lentiscus are rich in bioactive phenolic 132 components. For example, a study on Algerian mastic tree showed that total phenolic 133 mass fraction in leaves as gallic acid equivalents on dry matter basis (216.28 ± 20.62 mg/g) 134 was significantly higher than that in stems (121.39 ± 3.35 mg/g), fruits (103.34 ± 2.32 mg/g) 135 and roots (30.18 ± 1.29 mg/g). Among the phenolic compounds, the most abundant were 136 the flavonoids myricetin glycoside (134), catechin (124), β-glucogallin (162), and gallic 137 (107) and 5-O-galloylquinic acids (161)[2].  138 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 29   A study conducted by Mehenni et al.[28] asserts that the highest amounts of poly- 139 phenols were recorded in the aqueous chloroform extracts of both leaves and fruits, fol- 140 lowed by in ethanolic and aqueous ethyl acetate extracts. More specifically, the total 141 amounts of phenolics and flavonoids of leaf crude extracts (517.512 ± 5.53 mg catechin 142 Eq/g and 108.67 ± 0.5 mg rutin Eq/g, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than 143 those found in fruit crude extracts (254.9 ± 5.04 mg catechin Eq/g and 3.49 ± 1.19 mg rutin 144 Eq/g, respectively).  145 Aerial parts (leaves and fruits) of fresh P. lentiscus collected in different area of Sar- 146 dinia showed that in the leaves are present a large number of polyphenols, in particular 147 members of myricetin (127, 135, 136, 142, 143) and quercetin (128, 129, 140, 141). In con- 148 trast, phenolic acids predominate in fruits (107, 163, 165, 166, 170)[26]. 149 According to Belhachat[30]and Yosr[31], the total phenolic content varied from 17 150 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry matter (DM) to 955 mg GAE/g DM in the P. len- 151 tiscus extracts and among the same leaves extract, changes also depended on sex (100.8 vs 152 150.7 mg GAE/g DM in female and male respectively) and phenological stages (178.5 vs 153 87 mg GAE/g DM in dormancy period and late fruiting stage respectively)[31]. 154 Considering the fatty oil extracted from fruits of P. Lentiscus (PLFO), Djerrou et al. 155 [32] reported that it showed a good ratio (0.86) of polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated 156 fatty acid. The fatty acid composition consists of three dominant fatty acids: oleic acid 157 (150) (monounsaturated) at 54.4%, palmitic acid (154) (saturated) at 22.5% and linoleic 158 acid (152) (polyunsaturated) at 19.8%. The oil also contains sterols (157-160), tocopherol 159 (171), carotenoids and chlorophyll. 160 Furthermore, the oil is a rich source of phenolic compounds, with about 40 mole- 161 cules identified, as gallic acid (107), tyrosol (104), vanillic acid (108) and flavonoids as 162 kaempferol (123) and quercetin (125) [33]. The total phenolic content (TPC) and total 163 flavonoid content (TFC) for PLFO determined to be 25.19 ± 0.67 μg GAE/mg and 20.90 ± 164 4.41 μgquercitin equivalent (QE)/mg of PLFO, respectively. In the case of the unsaponi- 165 fiable fraction (USM), the quantity of TPC and TFC values were found to be 18.70 ± 2.89 166 μg GAE/mg and 12.5 ± 2.65 μg QE/mg of USM, respectively[33].  167 El Omari et al. [34]revelated that the mail compounds of P. Lentiscus essential oil 168 extracted from fruits are α-pinene (1) (20.46%) and limonene (3,10) (18.26%), conse- 169 quently both compounds were individually tested for the biological effects.  170 Kartalis et al.[35] described the effects of Chios mastic gum (CMG) on cholesterol 171 and glucose. CMG’s main components are an insoluble polymer (25%) and a triterpenic 172 fraction (67%), which is further subclassified as acidic (39%) and neutral (28%) fractions. 173 The acidic fraction main components are the masticadienonic acid (50) (30%), isomasti- 174 cadienonic acid (49) (30%), oleanonic acid (51) (15%) and moronic acid (47) (10%). The 175 neutral fraction’s main components include butyspermol (55), tirucallol (63), oleanolic 176 aldehyde (57), and betulonal (61). Another monoterpenic constituent of CMG, camphene 177 (7), seems to possess promising hypolipidemic activity. Antioxidant effects of Chios 178 mastic, that may result in reducing LDL cholesterol oxidation, could be attributed to the 179 resin’s remarkable concentration of various polyphenols.  180 However, any discrepancies in secondary metabolites concentrations may be due to 181 the collection period as well as soil conditions. 182 All the compounds identified in P. lentiscus, divided by class of molecules, are 183 summarized below in Table 1. 184 The overall analysis of the chemical composition showed that P. lentiscus contains 185 several bioactive molecules. The antidiabetic activities of extracts and/or single com- 186 pounds from P. lentiscus are in depth described in the following section. 187  188      Nutrients2024, 16, x. https://doi.org/10.3390/xxxxx www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients Table 1.

Anti-diabetic properties 199 3.1. In vitro experiments 200 3.1.1. α-Glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition 201 α-Glucosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.20) and α-amylase (E.C.3.2.1.1) belong to the enzyme targets in 202 the T2D treatment. Inhibition of these enzymes result in a decrease in glucose production 203 and absorption after a meal. In fact, these digestive enzymes first act in the mouth with 204 the activity of the salivary α-amylase, produced by salivary glands. Then, the digestion 205 carries on in the lumen of the small intestine with the endoglycosidase activity of the 206 pancreatic α-amylase, producing short oligosaccharides which can by hydrolysed by 207 α-glucosidase. α-Glucosidase, present in the brush border of the small intestine, pro- 208 duces therefore free glucose that can be absorbed and addressed into the blood. Thus, in 209 diabetic patients, one strategy is to inhibit these enzymes in order to prevent the 210 post-prandial hyperglycemia.  211 Inhibitory effect toward these enzymes by P. lentiscus has been reported.  212 Foddai et al.[26] reported the inhibition of enzymatic starch digestion by aqueous extract 213 from P. lentiscus leaves and fruits. A dose-dependent reduction in glucose release from 214 starch hydrolysis was observed and the IC50 values from leaves and fruits extracts re- 215 sulted to be 65.3 ± 7.4 µg/mL and 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/mL, respectively. The inhibition of 216 α-glucosidase and α-amylase activity separately was also investigated. α-Amylase inhi- 217 bition exerted by ethanolic extract from leaves and fruits was reported by Mehenni et al 218 [28]. Both extracts showed inhibition but less effective than that of acarbose, the standard 219 inhibitor, being leaves extract the more active with an IC50 value of 87.5 µg/mL, lower 220 than that of fruit extract (IC50 of 144.29 µg/mL).  221 These results were also confirmed by Tebbi et al.[25], that studied the inhibitory effect of 222 Pistacia lentiscus L. black fruits, extracted by choline chloride-acetic acid (ChCl-Acet) deep 223 eutectic solvent (DES) against α-amylase and founded that the extract showed a good 224 inhibitory activity on α-amylase with a percentage of 64.03 ±1.21% at 25 µg/mL. 225 Black fruits were also evaluated by Hamdi et al. [33]for their ability to inhibit α-amylase 226 and α-glucosidase. Pistacia lentiscus fatty oil (PLFO) of the extract and the unsaponifiable 227 matter (USM) were separated and examined for the above mentioned anti-diabetic ac- 228 tivities. PLFO displayed a low inhibitory effect on α-amylase (IC50> 400 μg/mL), although 229 USM demonstrated much greater inhibitory activity, with a IC50 value of 180.93 μg/mL, 230 20 times more effective than the standard molecule, acarbose (IC50 of 3650.93 μg/mL). 231 This significant inhibition of α-amylase enzyme by the unsaponifiable matter emphasizes 232 the significance of its isolation from the oil. As regard α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, 233 both PLFO and USM extracts exhibited good inhibitory activity (IC50 values of 136.47 and 234 155.77 μg/mL, respectively) in comparison with acarbose (IC50 of 275.43 μg/mL). These 235 results indicate that the inhibition of α-glucosidase could be attributed to USM but there 236 was no change in the inhibitory power as a result of its separation from the oil.  237 According to Sehaki et al. [1] aqueous lentisk extracts from leaves, stem barks and fruits 238 presented different percentages of inhibition against α-glucosidase at a concentration of 239 10 µg/mL, harvested from the two locations in Tizi-Ouzou (i.e., littoral and mountain). 240 The stem bark extracts were the most effective, with average values of 84.7 ± 5.9% (IC50of 241 5.8 ± 0.4μg/mL) and 69.9 ± 19.9% (IC50of 7.9 ±3.3μg/mL) at the littoral and mountain, re- 242 spectively, followed by leaves and finally the fruit extracts, that showed the lower inhib- 243 itory activity (13.6 ± 6.2%) at both locations.  244 Cherbal et al.[27]hows the impact of P. lentiscus L. hydro-methanolic leaf extract on the 245 activities of α-amylase and sucrase enzymes. The extract reveals a good inhibition against 246 α-amylase and sucrase activities, with a IC50 value of 5.81 mg/mL and 9.32 247 mg/mLrespectively. Therefore, higher inhibition is shown by the lower IC50 value, indi- 248 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 29   cating that the extract of P. lentiscus L. has more inhibitory effect on α-amylase than on 249 sucrase.  250 An in vitro system with yeast cells suspended in a glucose solution in the presence or 251 absence of the extract was used by the same authors [27]to examine the effect of P. len- 252 tiscusL. hydro-methanolic leaf extract on glucose transport across yeast cell membrane. 253 The process by which glucose is transported across the yeast cell membrane is also being 254 studied as an in vitro screening technique for the hypoglycemic impact of different 255 compounds and medicinal plants. An indicator of the amount of glucose taken up by the 256 yeast cells is the amount of glucose that is still in the medium after a specific time. The 257 result showed that P. lentiscus L. extract possesses the ability to increase glucose ab- 258 sorbtion on yeast cells in a dose-dependent manner, strongly correlated with the con- 259 centration of the extract, reaching 92.85% at 50 mg/mL. 260 Furthermore, essential oils and volatile molecules as potential natural substance candi- 261 dates, have recently attracted a lot of attention. In this context, El Omari et 262 al.[34]examined the antidiabetic properties of the volatile components of Pistacia lentiscus 263 essential oils (PLEOs), obtained from fruit extract and its main compounds, limonene and 264 α-pinene. The results showed that PLEO along with and α-pinene (1) and limonene (3,10) 265 exhibited promising antidiabetic potential, with IC50 values ranging from 78.03 ± 2.31 to 266 116.03 ± 7.42 μg/mL for α-glucosidase and from 74.39 ± 3.08 to 112.35 ± 4.92 μg/mL for 267 α-amylase assay. In particular, limonene was found to be the most active compound, 268 being the IC50 values equal to 78.03 ± 2.31 and 74.39 ± 3.08 μg/mL for α-glucosidase and 269 α-amylase, respectively. This suggests that limonene could represent a promising target 270 for the development of antidiabetic drugs.  271 Moreover, an effect of P. lentiscus toward α-glucosidase enzyme as target, has been re- 272 ported in a cellular system [36]. In fact, this study reported the biological effects of Chios 273 mastic extract in Caco-2 cells, a model of human small intestine mucosa. This extract, 274 with very high contents of triterpenes, demonstrated to modulate glucose metabolism in 275 Caco-2 cells by reducing disaccharidase activity along with sucrase–isomaltase expres- 276 sion.    277 Overall, these studies highlight that Pistacia lentiscus possess the ability to inhibit crucial 278 gastrointestinal enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion and absorption thus sup- 279 porting its potential as antidiabetic agents which can be useful on the management of 280 T2D. 281  282 3.1.2. Inhibition of lipase 283 Pancreatic lipase (PL, EC 3.1.1.3) represents another therapeutic target for the treatment 284 of T2D. It is the key enzyme in lipid absorption, responsible for digestion of dietary tri- 285 glycerides in the small intestine. PL catalyses the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols into free 286 fatty acids and monoacylglycerols which can be absorbed by enterocytes[37]. Excessive 287 lipids accumulation in the pancreas may contribute to insulin-producing β-cell dysfunc- 288 tion, characteristic of T2D. In this context, inhibitors of pancreatic lipase are attracting 289 much research interest due to their anti-obesity activity by delaying the lipolytic process. 290 This action would lead to the decrease in lipid absorption and thus protect the pancreas, 291 which will restore regular insulin production from the β cells. On this basis, Foddai et 292 al.[26] evaluated the inhibitory effect of Pistacia lentiscus leaves and fruits aqueous ex- 293 tracts against PL. The extracts exhibited highly significant in vitro dose-related inhibition 294 of PL. Among them, P. lentiscus leaves reveled to possess a IC50 value of 6.1 ± 0.2 μg/mL, 295 20 times lower that P. lentiscus fruits (125.2 ± 12.1 μg/mL).   296 These results contribute to consider Pistacia lentiscus as potential candidate for the de- 297 velopment of functional foods in obesity prevention and phytotherapy. 298 3.1.3. Inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1   299 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 29   11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1, E.C. 1.1.1.146) is an enzyme, 300 mainly expressed in liver and adipose tissues, that catalyzes the conversion of inactive 301 11-ketoglucocorticoids into active 11β-hydroxy-forms. It is also known as cortisone re- 302 ductase because it is a NADPH-dependent enzyme catalyzing the reduction of the inac- 303 tive cortisone to the active cortisol. In contrast, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 304 (11β-HSD2) is an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase catalyzing the oxidation of cortisol to 305 cortisone.  306 Since cortisol and glucocorticoids synthetized by 11β-HSD1 activity decrease glucose 307 uptake and enhance liver gluconeogenesis, affecting carbohydrate and fat metabolism, 308 increased enzymatic activity may result in obesity, insulin resistance and T2D[38]. Inhi- 309 bition of 11β-HSD1 activity decreases insulin-resistance and glucose production repre- 310 senting a therapeutic target for the development of potential drugs for T2D. There are 311 several known 11β-HSD1 inhibitors from synthetic or natural origin, the latter being 312 mostly triterpenes. Mustic gum from P. lentiscus is rich in triterpenes and the 11β-HSD1 313 inhibitory activity were investigated[39]. Oleoresin, acidic fraction and two triterpenes 314 isolated from the acidic fraction (masticadienonic and isomasticadienonic acids) showed 315 to selectively inhibit 11β-HSD1 and not 11β-HSD2. The inhibitory activity was evaluated 316 in lysed cells expressing 11β-HSD1. The IC50 values are reported and resulted to be 1.33 317 and 2.10 μg/mL for oleoresin and acidic fraction, and 2.51 and 1.94 μM for masticadi- 318 enonic (50) and isomasticadienonic (49) acids, respectively. Moreover, docking analysis 319 predicted the binding site of masticadienonic and isomasticadienonic acids and confirm 320 that both compounds occupied the 11β-HSD1 binding site, therefore they inhibit the 321 enzyme preventing the binding of its natural substrate [39].  322 Thus, one of the reasons why mastic gum is known for its anti-diabetic effect could be 323 represented by 11β-HSD1 inhibition and the consequent regulation of glucocorticoid 324 metabolism. 325 3.1.4. Biological activity towards PPARγ 326 The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear fatty acid tran- 327 scription factors involved in several diseases. In particular, PPARγ is the most studied 328 member of this family, which regulates glucose and lipid pathways with a high expres- 329 sion in adipose tissue and, to a lesser extent, in the liver and in the muscle. By binding to 330 a specific ligand, PPARγ regulate the transcription of several target genes in tissues 331 which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and homeostasis. PPARγ agonists, 332 such as thiazolidinediones (TZD), act as insulin-sensitizing agents and are currently used 333 in clinical practice for treatment of diabetes. They normalize the glucose profile promot- 334 ing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis[40]. 335 Despite the beneficial effect of using such drugs, there are several undesirable side effects 336 due to the use of TZDs, such as weight gain, fluid retention, heart failure, and hepato- 337 toxicity. The activation of PPARγ is affected by the type of agonist which may be full or 338 partial depending on the structural differences and activation profile. It has been re- 339 ported that a partial agonist seems to induce less side effects as observed for the full ag- 340 onist TZDs[41]. In this context, the identification of PPARγ partial agonists is a promising 341 strategy for diabetes management.  342 Peterson and colleagues [41]conducted a virtual screening for novel PPARγ partial ago- 343 nists and identified oleanonic acid (46) as a potential target molecule. Oleanonic acid is a 344 triterpene found in the oleoresin of Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia. Neutral and acidic fraction 345 of oleoresin showed to possess PPARγ activation properties. Specifically, a fraction of the 346 acidic fraction almost exclusively contained oleanonic acid and was further character- 347 ized. Dose response analysis and competition assay using a standard full agonist sug- 348 gested that this fraction containing oleanonic acid may function as a partial agonist for 349 PPARγ. This result was confirmed by docking analysis of oleanonic acid which showed 350 the aminoacidic interaction characteristic of a partial-agonist molecules.   351 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 29   Considering that this extract acts as partial PPARγ agonist, activity of this subfractions of 352 P. lentiscus oleoresin was less than that of a full-agonist reference compound. Otherwise, 353 it could contribute to the activities of the gum which has been described also towards 354 other T2D therapeutic target (i.e., 11β-HSD1), confirming the beneficial antidiabetic 355 properties of the Chios mastic gum. 356 3.2. In vivo experiments 357 3.2.1. Hypoglycaemic effect 358 To investigate the antiglycaemic effect of P. Lentiscus on mice, diabetes is induced 359 using two primary techniques, alloxan and streptozotocin (STZ). The alloxan-induced 360 diabetes technique involves a single intra-peritoneal injection of a freshly prepared 361 alloxan solution at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. This compound, acting as a toxic 362 glucose analogue, selectively accumulates in pancreatic beta cells via the GLUT2 glucose 363 transporter. Upon entry into the beta cells, alloxan undergoes a cyclic redox reaction, fa- 364 cilitated by intracellular thiols such as glutathione, generating reactive oxygen species 365 (ROS) and, ultimately, hydroxyl radicals. The ensuing oxidative stress leads to the death 366 of beta cells, resulting in insulin-dependent alloxan diabetes. Notably, alloxan also in- 367 hibits glucose-induced insulin secretion by selectively targeting the beta cell glucose 368 sensor glucokinase[42]. On the other hand, STZ-induced diabetes technique involves in- 369 tra-peritoneal administration of STZ dissolved in a citrate buffer, typically at a dose of 60 370 mg/kg. Following uptake into beta cells, STZ undergoes enzymatic cleavage, separating 371 into its glucose and methylnitrosourea components. The latter, with potent alkylating 372 properties, induces damage to biological macromolecules, including DNA fragmenta- 373 tion, leading to beta cell destruction and the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes[43]. 374 In the murine model of alloxan-induced diabetes, various experiments have ex- 375 plored the use of P. lentiscus. One study treated mice with a hydro-methanolic leaves ex- 376 tract at 300 mg/kg, resulting in a significant 36% reduction in blood glucose levels and an 377 accompanying increase in plasma insulin levels[27]. Another study on crude Pistacia 378 gum treatment at 100 mg/kg in diabetic mice showed significantly lower blood glucose 379 levels compared to untreated diabetic mice with crude P. lentiscus showing comparable 380 effectiveness to the anti-diabetic drug glibenclamide in maintaining glucose homeosta- 381 sis[44]. This study also assessed liver function markers alanine transaminase (ALT) and 382 aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, which were significantly lowered in P. len- 383 tiscus-treated group at 21st day as compared to diabetic untreated and 384 glibenclamide-treated groups.   385 In the murine model of STZ-induced diabetes, treatment with ethanol extracts of P. 386 lentiscus leaves and fruits at concentrations of 50 mg/kg and 125 mg/kg, demonstrated a 387 substantial reduction in blood glucose levels comparable to the reference drug 388 glibenclamide. Additionally, flower extracts exhibited a milder effect, while leaves ex- 389 tracts restored blood glucose to normal values after a two-hour treatment, emphasizing 390 their efficacy in diabetes management[28]. 391 Several clinical studies have demonstrated the anti-hyperglycemic effects of Chios 392 Mastic gum on human volunteers[35].  393 In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study involving 156 volun- 394 teers with total cholesterol levels >200 mg/dl were divided into four groups: control 395 group (receiving placebo), total mastic  group (receiving 1 g of total crude mastic gum 396 capsules three times daily), polymer-free mastic group (receiving 1 g of polymer-free 397 mastic capsules three times daily), and powder mastic group (receiving 2 g of crude 398 mastic gum daily). After eight weeks, the total crude mastic gum group showed a sig- 399 nificant reduction in fasting plasma glucose by 4.5 mg/dl (p< 0.05), particularly in over- 400 weight and obese individuals with body mass index, BMI > 25. The other groups did not 401 exhibit significant alterations in glucose levels, although there was a trend towards re- 402 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 29   duction. No adverse events were reported, and there were no changes in BMI, liver en- 403 zymes, or renal function markers[35]. 404 In another double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving healthy 405 Japanese men over 40 years old, Chios mastic gum intake alone and in combination with 406 physical activity led to significant reductions in insulin levels, and insulin resistance 407 compared to a control group. Specifically, CMG intake alone reduced insulin resistance 408 values at 6 months. Moreover, CMG intake combined with exercise reduced insulin re- 409 sistance already at 3 months, suggesting its importance, along with physical activity, in 410 effectively managing glucose metabolism[45]. 411 3.2.2. Hypolipidemic effect 412 Several studies have investigated the hypolipidemic effects of Pistacia lentiscus, both 413 in animal models and human subjects, highlighting its potential therapeutic value in 414 managing lipid-related disorders.  415 In mice with induced hypercholesterolemia by administering food containing high 416 cholesterol (1%) for thirty days, administration of aqueous leaves extract of P. lentiscus 417 resulted in significant reductions in total cholesterol (from 253 ± 31.60 mg/dL to 154.6 ± 418 18.10 mg/dL), triglycerides (from 200 ± 12.32 mg/dL to 97.6 ± 3.57 mg/dL), and 419 LDL-cholesterol levels (from 160 ± 31.60 to 145.88 ± 9.76 mg/dL). Similarly, treatment 420 with ethanolic leaves extract significantly decreased total cholesterol (154.6 ± 18.10 421 mg/dL), triglyceride (71.2 ± 4.38 mg/dL), and LDL-cholesterol (99.36 ± 18.77 mg/dL) levels 422 compared to the hypercholesterolemic control group, indicating its potential as a hypo- 423 lipidemic agent[46]. In STZ-induced diabetic mice low and high doses of Chios mastic 424 gum resulted in improvements in lipid profiles. After 4 weeks of CMG administration, 425 serum triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in both the low-dose and high-dose 426 treated groups compared to the control group. Additionally, at the end of the 8-week 427 study period, the low-dose treated group exhibited further improvements in serum total 428 cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels, along with increased HDL levels compared to 429 the control group[47].  430 In rabbit models, mastic total extract without polymer and its neutral fraction 431 demonstrated significant reductions in myocardial infarction size and atherosclerosis, 432 alongside notable hypolipidemic effects in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Additionally, 433 histological analysis revealed a reduction in subintimal lipid accumulation and foamy 434 macrophages in aortic tissue samples from rabbits treated with both extracts, suggesting 435 anti-atherosclerotic and anti-lipidemic properties[48].  436 Likewise, in rabbits fed with a hyperlipidemic diet containing egg yolk, P. lentiscus 437 fatty oil was administered. The results showed that egg yolk consumption significantly 438 elevated total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL/HDL ratio compared to the control 439 group. However, treatment with P. lentiscus fatty oil or simvastatin significantly reduced 440 total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL. Specifically, triglycerides levels decreased by 441 50.75% compared to egg yolk consumption group without fatty oil. No significant 442 changes were observed in HDL levels[32].   443 CMG has been extensively studied in several randomized controlled trials to assess 444 its effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as its potential therapeutic benefits in 445 managing various metabolic disorders. In the study described in the previous section 446 (Section 3.2.1.) involving healthy Japanese men over 40 years old, CMG intake alone and 447 in combination with physical activity as well as manage glucose metabolism, also led to 448 significant reductions in serum triglycerides[45]. 449 Another in vivo human study focused on Chios Mastiha Essential Oil (CMEO) 450 demonstrated significant improvements in blood lipid profile, including reductions in 451 triglycerides and LDL, along with other metabolic markers in individuals with ab- 452 dominal obesity and metabolic abnormalities. Moreover, it was found a decrease in sys- 453 tolic blood pressure and ALT levels only after CMEO intake, reduction in weight, % body 454 Nutrients 2024, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 29   fat, and visceral fat and also improvement in health-related quality of life scores, both 455 physical and mental, in the CMEO group compared to controls[49].  456 Furthermore, total mastic gum also showed the ability to reduce total cholesterol 457 levels by 11.5 mg/dl (p < 0.05), with a stronger effect observed in overweight and obese 458 individuals[35]. 459 Finally, 133 participants aged over 50 were randomly assigned to either a high-dose 460 group consuming 5 g of mastic powder daily or a low-dose group receiving a Chios 461 mastic solution. Throughout the study duration, the high-dose group exhibited signifi- 462 cant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, lipoprotein, 463 apolipoprotein A-1, apolipoprotein B, SGOT, SGPT, and gamma-GT levels. However, 464 glucose, HDL, and triglyceride levels remained unchanged in this group. Interestingly, 465 only male subjects in the low-dose group displayed a notable decrease in serum glucose 466 levels. These findings suggest potential benefits of Chios mastic powder in improving 467 lipid profiles and hepatic enzymes[50]. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate 468 these effects and their clinical implications. 469 All the antidiabetic activities of Pistacia lentiscus extracts or isolated compounds are 470 reported in Table 2 together with identified compounds for each active extract, where 471 reported in the literature. 472  473      Nutrients2024, 16, x. https://doi.org/10.3390/xxxxx www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients  474 Table 2.

Conclusions and Future Directions 480 The present review highlighted the promising health-promoting activities of P. len- 481 tiscus in T2D treatment. P. lentiscus has been recognized as an herbal medicine for dif- 482 ferent disorders and here we presented all the available information concerning its anti- 483 diabetic properties. In fact, several extracts and compounds from different parts of the 484 plant showed activity against one or more targets implicated in T2D treatment. Unlike 485 T1D, T2D is a complex pathology which need a combination therapy by using two or 486 more drugs against totally different targets in order to reduce hyperglycemia and hyper- 487 lipidemia, both contributing to diabetic disease. While combination therapy can be effec- 488 tive, it often exacerbates side effects. The ultimate objective in T2D management is to 489 identify a single drug capable of acting on multiple targets to mitigate the complications 490 associated with polypharmacy. As reported from the literature, P. lentiscus showed in 491 vitro (in cell-free and in cellular systems) and in vivo activities towards more targets, 492 emerging as a good candidate for multitarget drug discovery in T2D treatment.   493 Additionally, we have compiled a summary of the compounds found in P. lentiscus 494 and the extracts in which each compound has been identified. Thus, from the analysis of 495 all the data present in the literature, one future perspective could be to identify which 496 compounds are responsible for the activities of the extracts with the possibility of iden- 497 tifying novel and potent active molecules. 498 Author Contributions: Conceptualization, S.F., A.D.P., F.P. and G.L.D.; investigation, S.F., A.D.P., 499 F.P. and G.L.D.; data curation,S.F., F.P. and G.L.D.; writing—original draft preparation, S.F., 500 A.D.P., F.P. and G.L.D. writing—review and editing, S.F., F.P. and G.L.D.
