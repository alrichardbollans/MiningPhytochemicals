Abstract 
Banana fruit is enriched with phytonutrients, minerals, and its peel, which is mostly discarded as waste. This 
research aimed to study its bioactive compound properties, antimicrobial activity, and identify and 
characterize the constituents of organic banana peel extract (BPE), composed of six species (i.e., Kluai 
Homthong, Kluai Namwa, Kluai Kai, Kluai Hukmook, Kluai Lebmuernang, and Kluai Homtaiwan). Total 
phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant content, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were important 
in BPE of Kluai Kai. BPE of Kluai Hukmook could inhibit Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus aureus. 
The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum exposed diverse compounds of primary and 
secondary phytochemicals. Four main constituents, including acetic acid, formic acid, 1,2-benzenediol,3-
methyl-, and 4-hydroxy-2-methylacetophone derived from gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-
MS), demonstrated their antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity. This result suggests that organic 
banana peel can both be applied as an antioxidant and antimicrobial substance. BPE increases the value of 
banana peels (BPs) and reduces the burden of its waste disposal in the environment.

1. Introduction 
Presently, the natural compound from herbs and plants are widely used as growth-stimulating 
compounds, antimicrobial substances, and nutrients (Sulaiman et al. 2011). They are enriched in bioactive 
compounds that include fiber and phenolic compounds, which are related to antioxidant capacity. They are 
better than synthetic antibiotics in treating infectious disease, as they limit many of the adverse effects. 
Moreover, the plant extract is used as an additive in animal feed, which may provide an inexpensive agent 
in aquaculture, promoting survival rate, stimulating immunity, and offering greater reliability than 
chemotherapeutic agents. However, the side-effects and consumed doses of plant extract should be 
considered before utilization. 
Banana, belonging to the family Musaceae, is a very prevalent fruit around the world, and is eaten in 
many regions as a staple food (Singh et al. 2016). It is grown extensively and comprises the fifth largest 
agricultural food crop in terms of world trade, ranking alongside rice, wheat, and maize. It is a rich source of

Determination of bioactive compounds, antimicrobial activity, and the phytochemistry of the organic banana peel in Thailand 
significant phytonutrients, including vitamins and phenolic compounds. It is also notably enriched with 
minerals such as sodium phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese. It 
contains many bioactive components, such as phenolic, carotenoids, biogenic amines, and phytosterols, 
which are highly beneficial in the diet, as they have positive effects on human health and well-being (Singh 
et al. 2016). In the past, banana was effectively used in the treatment of various diseases, such as reducing 
the risk of chronic degenerative disorders. Phenolic compounds, secondary metabolites in banana, are 
known for their antioxidant properties in protecting the body against various oxidative stress (Amri and 
Hossain 2018). Total phenolic aspects of a banana are reported to be more abundant in the peel, consistent 
with its antioxidant activity. The banana peel (BP) is the major by-product obtained during banana 
processing. BP is a good source of polyphenol, carotenoids, and other bioactive compounds which process 
its beneficial effects on human health. Different components have antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory, and anticancer activities. BP contains high levels of phytochemical compounds, mainly 
antioxidants. Phenolic compounds in BP (Musa acuminata Colla AAA) range from 0.90 to 3.0 g/100 g dry 
weight (Singh et al. 2016). The antioxidant capacity of banana is increased during flesh maturity, with a 
higher capacity than some berries, herbs, and vegetables (Ummarat et al. 2011). In the banana processing 
industry, significant quantities of BP, equivalent to 40% of the total weight of a fresh banana, are generated 
as waste up to 0.3 million tons (MT) per year, posing a disposal problem (Housagul et al. 2014).  
In the present study, BP varieties were extracted with 50% methanol. Bioactive compounds of BPE 
were analyzed by the DPPH and FRAP methods. Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus were used as indicators for antimicrobial activity determination. Phytochemicals 
contained in BPE were examined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
 
2. Material and Methods 
Location of organic banana farm and harvesting 
The organic banana was cultured with a process as well as farming at Fungkajorn Garden Organic 
Farm, Nong Suea, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand, at GPS: 14°10'12.6"N 100°48'00.4"E. 
 
Preparation of banana peel 
The six most common banana strains found in Thailand include: Kluai Kai, Kluai Homthong, Kluai 
Homtaiwan, Kluai Lebmuernang, Kluai Hukmook, and Kluai Namwa, were collected in the raw stage. The raw 
banana was matured in a plastic box until the peel color index (PCI) reached a level of 7, yellow with brown 
speckles (Soltani et al. 2010). Matured banana fruits were cleaned with tap water, rinsed twice to remove 
dust, and other extraneous materials adhering to them, and soaked in soda water for 5 min (Rattanavichai 
and Cheng 2014). The washed BP was separated, cut into small pieces, and dried in hot-air oven at 50°C until 
moisture content decreased to approximately 10%. The dried BP was ground into a powder with an 
electronic grinder and stored at 4°C for further experiments. 
 
Extraction of banana peel 
Ten grams of dried BP powder was added to 100 mL of 50%v/v methanol. The mixture was extracted 
in a water bath at 55°C for 120 min and continuously stirred. The mixture was left and precipitated at room 
temperature. The sample was centrifuged to collect the supernatant at 5,000 rpm for 20 min. The methanol 
portion in obtained supernatant was removed with a vacuum rotary evaporator until completely 
evaporated. The sticky crude extracted was collected from the extraction bottle by redissolved with H2O and 
kept at -20°C for the next experiments. 
  
Bioactive compound properties assay 
The amount of total phenolic content in crude BPE was measured by modifying the method of 
Singleton and Rossi (Singleton and  Rossi 1965). The antioxidant activity was determined by the DPPH

method according to Blios (1958). The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was evaluated following 
the method of Benzie and Strain (Benzie and Strain 1996). 
 
Antimicrobial activity 
Antimicrobial activity of crude BPE was analyzed by the disc diffusion method (Rattanavichai and 
Cheng 2014) in the following pathogens: A. hydrophila, S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus. The pathogen 
was spread on nutrient agar (NA). The sterilized paper disc was soaked in BPE and placed on the NA plate, 
smeared with a pathogen. The water and methanol were utilized as controls and incubated at 37°C for 24 
h. The antimicrobial activity of BPE will be shown by clear zone and reported as positive (+) or negative (-) 
results. 
 
Phytochemical analysis: FTIR 
The FTIR (iD7ATR Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to specify the functional groups of 
phytochemicals of different crude BPE. The translucent sample discs were prepared by mixing 10 mg KBr salt 
and 1 mg freeze-dried powder of different extracts of plant material. The mixtures were packed in a FTIR 
spectroscopy  (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan)  (4 cm-1 resolution) with a frequency  range of 4,000 to 400 
cm-1. 
 
Phytochemical analysis: GC-MS 
The phytochemical components were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) 
(GC-MSQP2010 SE, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The chromatography column was DB-5MS (30 m x 0.25 
mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness). The injector temperature was operated at 220°C. The oven temperature 
was programmed at 45°C, held for 5 min, increased to 60°C at 2°C/min, increased to 220°C at 3°C/min, and 
held for 10 min. The carrier gas was helium and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). 
 
Statistical analysis 
The results were presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD) of triplicate experiments. 
Significant differences were determined by one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) and by comparing the 
experiment by Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMR) at α < 0.05 and performed by SPSS v. 15.0 (IBM, Armonk, 
NY, USA). 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Extraction of BP 
The characteristics of fresh, hot air-dried, and powdered BP were illustrated in figures 1A-1C. The 
color of fresh BP changed from yellow to black and brown after hot air-drying, and powdering processes, 
respectively. Table 1 indicates the weight of BP before and after hot air-drying in the oven at 50°C for 48 h. 
The moisture content of dried BP ranged from 5.2 to 7.3% (wet basis), which depended on the thickness of 
each type. The moisture decreased from the surface of samples through capillary action. The unbound water 
was transported from the surface via material capillaries (Rahman et al. 2015). Next, the BP powder was 
extracted by 50% v/v of methanol. Results showed that the maximum extraction, for 3.50 g /10 g DM, yield 
was obtained from the BP of Kluai Homthong.

Antioxidant assay of BPE: Total phenolic content (TPC) 
The TPC of obtained crude BPE is presented in figure 2A. The results showed that Kluai Kai provided 
the highest TPC of 7.82 ± 0.64 mg GAE/g DM, followed by Kluai Homthong, Kluai Homtaiwan, Kluai 
Lebmuernang, and Kluai Hukmook (5.58 ± 0.60, 3.42 ± 0.50, 2.47 ± 0.05 and 2.12 ± 0.07 mg GAE/g DM), 
respectively, while Kluai Namwa gave the lowest TPC of 1.38 ± 0.31 mg GAE/g DM. These results 
demonstrated that the TPC depended on the type of banana. González-Montelongo et al. (2010) measured 
the total phenolic content of BPE, extracted by 50%v/v of methanol at 55°C for 120 min. Two different 
varieties, Gruesa and Grande Naine (M. acuminata Colla AAA) provided the TPC of 16.0 and 17.0 mg GAE/g 
DM, respectively. This result suggests that the quantity and quality of phenolic compounds from plants are 
influenced by geographical origin, plant genetics, cultivar, soil composition, growing conditions, state of 
maturity, post-harvest processing, drying, and extraction methods (Jeffery et al. 2003; Mallavadhani et al. 
2006). 
 
Antioxidant assay of BPE: Antioxidant content 
The amount of antioxidant content was measured by the DPPH radical method, according to Blios 
(1958). The maximum amount of antioxidant content of BPE was detected in Kluai Kai (7.15 ± 1.30 mg TE/g 
DM), followed by Kluai Homthong, Kluai Homtaiwan, Kluai Namwa, and Kluai Lebmuernang (5.52 ± 0.05, 
1.94 ± 0.17, 1.22 ± 0.24, and 1.02 ± 0.12 mg TE/g DM), respectively (Figure 2B), while the minimum 
antioxidant content was seen in Kluai Hukmook (0.97 ± 0.07 mg TE/g DM). The antioxidant content of BPE in 
this study was lower than that of Gruesa and Grande Naine (9.4 and 8.8 mg TE/g DM, respectively) due to 
the difference in species and extraction method (González-Montelongo et al. 2010). The antioxidant 
compounds were widely known to prevent or inhibit the oxidative reduction in the human body. Moreover, 
antioxidants can retard aging, prevent coronary heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders 
related to oxidative stress, caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Singh et al. 2016). Polyphenols are 
antioxidant compounds in a plant’s innate defense system; the antioxidant content is synthesized under 
stress conditions, such as temperature alterations, UV exposure, and pathogenic attacks (Dixon and Paiva 
1995).

Antioxidant assay of BPE: Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) 
Figure 2C presents the amount of FRAP of BPE, analyzed with the method used by Benzie and Strain 
(1996). The maximum FRAP was found in BPE of Kluai Kai for 2.74 ± 0.13 mg GAE/g DM, followed by Kluai 
Homthong and Kluai Homtaiwan. However, the FRAP of Kluai Lebmuernang, Kluai Hukmook, and Kluai 
Namwa was not significantly different. Moreover, the FRAP of BPE allows reductants to be electron donors, 
which is able to convert them into more stable constituents and terminate the free radical reaction (Aboul 
et al. 2016).

Antimicrobial activity 
Three pathogens of aquatic animals were chosen to indicate the antimicrobial activity in this study. 
The nhibition zone of a pathogen by BPE is presented in table 2. The results demonstrated that A. hydrophila 
was inhibited by all BPE except that of Kluai Kai. In addition, the BPE of Kluai Hukmook could also inhibit S. 
aureus, while V. parahaemolyticus could not be inhibited by any BPE. It has been suggested that the 
antimicrobial activity of BPE is related to the type of banana. The previous study reported on the 
antibacterial activity of BP (Musa, AAA cv. Cavendish), which shows that the BP used ethyl acetate to extract 
the inhibited Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and S. aureus (Mokbel 
and Hashinaga 2005). Normally, plant extracts have antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The hydroxyl 
group of the phenolic compound can have an inhibitory effect on target bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria 
are more sensitive than gram-positive bacteria, with differences in their cell wall structures. The gram-
positive bacteria have a thick multilayer peptidoglycan cell wall, which is an obstacle to environmental 
materials, including natural matter and antibiotics. In contrast, the cells of gram-negative bacteria have 
single peptidoglycan in the outer layer. As such, gram-negative bacteria have a penetrability barrier lower 
than gram-positive bacteria (Saleem and Saeed 2020).

Determination of bioactive compounds, antimicrobial activity, and the phytochemistry of the organic banana peel in Thailand 
Furthermore, gram-negative bacteria have a low resistance to physical disruption due to a weak cell 
wall structure. In a previous study, the extract of pomegranate peels, yellow lemon peels, orange peels, and 
banana peel containing phenolic compounds was responsible for excellent antimicrobial activities (Al-zoreky 
2009; Mehrotra et al. 2017; Saleem and Saeed 2020). However, the modification of outer membrane 
permeability and porin mutation increases the resistance ability in gram-negative bacteria. On the other 
hand, this important layer is absent in gram-positive bacteria. Thereby, gram-negative bacteria can be more 
resistant to antibiotics and cause health problems than gram-positive ones (Breijyeh et al. 2020).

Phytochemicals in BPE: FTIR analysis 
FTIR measurements were taken to identify the major functional groups of the BPE. The infrared 
spectra of Kluai Kai, Kluai Homthong, Kluai Homtaiwan, Kluai Lebmuernang, Kluai Hukmook, and Kluai 
Namwa were similar to each other, conveying that they contained similar functional groups (Figure 3 and 
Table 3). The strong peaks, at frequencies between 3,328 and 3,344 cm-1, were assigned to O–H stretching, 
which represents the free hydroxyl group of the polymer: lignins and BP pectins (Deshmukh et al. 2017), 
phenols,  González-Cabrera et al. 2018) and polysaccharides (Nogales et al. 2017). At these frequencies, it 
was attributed to the presence of O–H stretching of a carboxylic group from the two main constituents of 
GC-MS: acetic acid and formic acid. The distinctive peak at around 1,636 cm-1 was assigned to the stretching 
C=C ring and the COO- antisymmetric stretching of aromatic and carboxylate ions, ( González-Cabrera et al. 
2018) and amides’ C=C stretching present in phytoconstituents of BPE (Thomas and Johney 2017). 
Gnanasambandam and Proctor (2000) found the stronger bands between 1,640 and 1,620 cm-1 to be an 
important region that identified and quantified pectin samples. The prominent peak of ester linkage of the 
carboxylic group from lignin or hemicellulose appears at around 1,730 cm-1, normally found in BPE; this 
disappeared, which might be due to the chemical treatment of BPs (Alemdar and Sain 2008). The weak 
absorption band between 1,395 to 1,412 cm-1 was characteristic of C=C in aromatic rings and COO- 
symmetric stretching of carboxylate ions (Kamsonlian et al. 2011;  González-Cabrera et al. 2018; 
Gnanasambandam and Proctor 2000). The IR spectrum of BPE of Kluai Kai, Kluai Homthong, and Kluai 
Lebmuernang exhibited C-O stretching and C-C stretching between 1,058 to 1,061 cm-1, indicating the 
existence of cellulose and phenol ( González-Cabrera et al. 2018; Patial et al. 2019). Lu et al. (2011) specified 
the wavenumber between 950 and 1,200 cm-1 as the main functional group of carbohydrates, whereas 
Khamsucharit et al. (2018) found that the pectin of BP was the “fingerprint” region between 800 to 1,300 
cm-1.  The FTIR absorption peak of six BPE indicates the existence of functional groups, like hydroxyl and 
carboxyl, in agreement with BPE of other studies (Memon et al. 2009; Alejandra et al. 2015; El-nafaty et al. 
2013; Thomas and Johney 2017).

Phytochemicals in BPE: GC-MS analysis 
GC-MS was used to investigate the phytochemical composition in crude BPE of six banana types. The 
results of numerous BPE by GC-MS contained 1 to 3 main chemical constituents. The different components 
of BPE would be affected by the species of banana and cultivation conditions, maturity, and extraction 
method (Vu et al. 2018). The main constituents were identified from the data of various BPE and shown in 
table 3 and figure 4. The major compounds were acetic acid, formic acid, 1,2-benzenediol,3-methyl-, and 4-
hydroxy-2-methylacetophone. These major compounds have various biological activities, such as 
antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. The acetic acid, formic acid, and 4-hydroxy-2-
methylacetophone were the antibacterial and antifungal properties (Fraise et al. 2013; Cheremisinoff and 
Rosenfeld 2010; Mordi et al. 2016). The 4-hydroxy-2-methylacetophone in Musa acuminata Colla 
demonstrated the inhibition on several bacterial strains: Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas 
spp., E. coli, Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp. (Mordi et al. 2016). Acetic acid was shown 
to have good antibacterial activity against microorganisms, while formic acid functioned as an important 
intermediate in chemical synthesis, and an antibacterial and preservative agent in livestock feed. The 1,2- 
benzenediol,3-methyl- is one of the phenolic compounds in the flavan-3-ol group, which also has antioxidant 
activity (Fraise et al. 2013; Cheremisinoff and Rosenfeld 2010).

4. Conclusions 
In summary, the present study exposed bioactive compound properties and identified the 
phytochemical aspect of the most popular banana from a local organic farm in Thailand. BPE showed a 
difference in TPC, antioxidant activity, and FRAP. Moreover, antimicrobial activity was affected by the type 
of banana. The acetic acid, formic acid, 1,2-benzenediol,3-methyl-, and 4-hydroxy-2-methylacetophone 
were phytochemicals found in BPE and represent antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity. There is the 
possibility of applying BPE to supplement animal and aquatic feed to improve growth and immunity.
