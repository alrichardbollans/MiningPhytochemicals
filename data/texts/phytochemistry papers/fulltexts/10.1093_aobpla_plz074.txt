Gene copy number is associated with phytochemistry in Cannabis sativa. AoB PLANTS 11: plz074; doi: 10.1093/aobpla/plz074AbstractGene copy number (CN) variation is known to be important in nearly every species where it has been examined. Alterations in gene CN may provide a fast way of acquiring diversity, allowing rapid adaptation under strong selective pressures, and may also be a key component of standing genetic variation within species. Cannabis sativa plants produce a distinguishing set of secondary metabolites, the cannabinoids, many of which have medicinal utility. Two major cannabinoids—THCA (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) and CBDA (cannabidiolic acid)—are products of a three-step biochemical pathway. Using whole-genome shotgun sequence data for 69 Cannabis cultivars from diverse lineages within the species, we found that genes encoding the synthases in this pathway vary in CN. Transcriptome sequence data show that the cannabinoid paralogs are differentially expressed among lineages within the species. We also found that CN partially explains variation in cannabinoid content levels among Cannabis plants. Our results demonstrate that biosynthetic genes found at multiple points in the pathway could be useful for breeding purposes, and suggest that natural and artificial selection have shaped CN variation. Truncations in specific paralogs are associated with lack of production of particular cannabinoids, showing how phytochemical diversity can evolve through a complex combination of processes.Keywords:  Cannabinoid; CBD; chemotype; copy number variation; hemp; marijuana; metabolic pathway; THC.  IntroductionGene copy number (CN) varies among individuals of the same species, which may have considerable phenotypic impacts (Stranger et al. 2007; Gaines et al. 2010). Both genome size and complexity can be increased by gene duplication (Losos et  al. 2013), and new genes can be adaptive (Losos et al. 2013). Copy number variation seems to be related to gene function, with those encoding biochemical pathway hubs tending to have lower duplicability and evolution rates (Yamada and Bork 2009). The genes encoding for proteins that interact with the environment reportedly have a higher duplicability (Prachumwat and Li 2006; Yamada and Bork 2009), particularly, stress-response genes in multiple plant systems have a high mutation rate (Gaines et al. 2010; Hardigan et al. 2016). Therefore, CN variation can provide a path to rapid evolution in strong selective regimes (Gaines et al. 2010), such as changing environments (Żmieńko et al. 2014; Hardigan et  al. 2016) or domestication (Swanson-Wagner et  al. 2010; Ollivier et al. 2016).Copy number variation occurs most commonly via gene duplication (Stranger et al. 2007; Losos et al. 2013) and CN variants are often selected during domestication (Swanson-Wagner et al. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article-abstract/11/6/plz074/5634137 by guest on 23 December 2019Copyedited by: AS2 | AoB PLANTS, 2019, Vol. XX, No. XX2010; Ollivier et al. 2016). Three general modes of persistence of duplicated genes that may lead to CN variation have been proposed. The first mode is concerted evolution, in which the gene copies maintain similar sequence and function but the concentration of the gene product is augmented (Lynch 2007; Losos et al. 2013). The second mode is neofunctionalization in which a copied gene acquires a novel function (Lynch 2007; Losos et al. 2013). Finally, in subfunctionalization, the original function of the gene becomes split among the copies (Lynch 2007; Losos et al. 2013).Recently, humans have intensively bred for high levels of THCA (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) and CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) (ElSohly et  al. 2000, 2016; ElSohly and Slade 2005; Volkow et al. 2014), the two most abundant and well-studied secondary metabolites (also referred to as specialized metabolites) produced by Cannabis sativa. As Cannabis has had a long history of domestication (Li 1973, 1974; Russo 2007), with recent intense selection (ElSohly et al. 2000, 2016; ElSohly and Slade 2005; Volkow et al. 2014), CN variation is likely to be found in these synthases (McKernan et  al. 2015; Weiblen et  al. 2015; Grassa et  al. 2018; Laverty et  al. 2019). Cannabis sativa, an angiosperm from the family Cannabaceae (Bell et al. 2010), produces numerous of these secondary metabolites called cannabinoids, which are a primary distinguishing characteristic of the plant. These two compounds—THCA and CBDA—when heated are converted to the neutral forms delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), respectively (Russo 2011), which are the forms that interact with the human body (Hart et  al. 2001). These compounds have a plethora of both long-known and recently discovered medicinal (Russo 2011; Swift et al. 2013; Volkow et al. 2014) and psychoactive properties (ElSohly and Slade 2005) and are most abundant in the trichomes of female flowers (Sirikantaramas et  al. 2005; Gagne et al. 2012). The enzymes responsible for their production, THCA and CBDA synthases (hence THCAS and CBDAS), are alternative end catalysts of a biochemical synthesis pathway (Fig. 1; (Sirikantaramas et al. 2005; Gagne et al. 2012; Page and Boubakir 2014). Finally, certain Cannabis chemovars contain higher THCA concentrations (e.g. ‘marijuana-type’ cultivars), while other Cannabis chemovars contain higher CBDA concentrations (e.g. hemp and high-CBDA ‘marijuana’ varieties) (de Meijer et al. 1992; Rustichelli et al. 1998; Mechtler et al. 2004; Datwyler and Weiblen 2006). However, recent research has found genetic support for Cannabis phylogenetics that correlates strongly with leaf morphology (Clarke and Merlin 2013; Lynch et al. 2016), with the Broad Leaf Marijuana-type and the Narrow Leaf Marijuana-type used medically and recreationally, and the hemp group used for industrial purposes. The designations ‘Broad Leaf’ and ‘Narrow Leaf’ used in Lynch et al. (2016), and adopted in this study, imply that these groupings are based on leaf morphology. However, it is important to note that although leaf morphology serves as a useful designation, their grouping is based on molecular phylogenetics, not morphological.It was once thought that THCAS and CBDAS were two Mendelian-inherited alleles from the same gene and that allelic variation determined the predominant cannabinoid composition (de Meijer et  al. 1992, 2003; Hillig and Mahlberg 2004; Pacifico et  al. 2006; Onofri et  al. 2015). However, it has recently been established that there are multiple genes in close proximity that are responsible for the production of cannabinoids (McKernan et al. 2015; Weiblen et al. 2015; Grassa et al. 2018; McKernan et al. 2018; Laverty et al. 2019). Therefore, an alternative explanation for observed phytochemical diversity is that CN variation may contribute to different cannabinoid phenotypes in the C. sativa cultivars (McKernan et al. 2015).Due to the medical potential of this pathway in regard to using cannabinoids for treating illnesses, and the possibility that CN variation in the genes that encode their enzymes may affect cannabinoid content, we explored the inter- and intra-cultivar differences in these genes. Since the discovery of the multiple paralogs of the cannabinoid synthases a new question arises of how CN variation in r of these paralogs relates to the chemotypes of the plants that contain them. Using two de novo C. sativa genome assemblies and an additional 67 Whole Genome Shotgun data sets from a diversity of cultivars, we addressed three questions: (i) Do lineages differ in number of cannabinoid synthase paralogs? (ii) Does cannabinoid content correlate to the number of respective synthase paralogs by cultivar? (iii) Do cannabinoid synthase paralogs vary in expression level by tissue and cultivar?Materials and MethodsGenome assemblies and gene annotation within the assembliesWe used two different genome assemblies for this study. The first was from a high-THCA marijuana-type male, Pineapple Banana Bubba Kush (PBBK), sequenced using PacBio Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Long-Read (LR) technology (Eid et  al. 2009; Rhoads and Au 2015), provided by Steep Hill, Inc. (NCBI GenBank Whole Genome Shotgun accession number MXBD01000000). Even though this is a male assembly, we believe that the genomic regions related to cannabinoid production are independent of the plant’s sex. However, further studies may elucidate the expression differences between male and female Cannabis plants that make females more prone to produce more cannabinoids in their flowers. The second assembly was constructed in 2011 from a high-THCA dioecious female marijuana-type Purple Kush (PK) plant, sequenced on the Illumina platform (van Bakel et al. 2011). Most results from this assembly will be given in the Supporting Information—Methods and Results. Both assemblies vary in their completeness, as each have some missing BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990; Gish and States 1993) hits as described below and in the Supporting Information—Methods and Results. Each assembly has some duplicated regions, with patterns of coverage suggesting that allelic variation at heterozygous loci lead to two different sequences assembled at a single genomic location. Because both are flawed due to these and other likely misassemblies (Vergara et  al. 2016), it was necessary to use both assemblies, which allowed us to find at least one hit for every target gene in order to understand the whole cannabinoid pathway.We found 11 and 5 BLAST hits for putative CBDA/THCA synthase genes in the PBBK and PK assembly, respectively, for a total of 16 potential paralogs in the CBDAS/THCAS gene family [see Supporting Information—Table S1]. Based on percent-identity scores, we found a hit in each assembly that appears to code for THCAS. We identified two hits in the PBBK and one in the PK assemblies that likely code for CBDAS. We used the CBDAS and THCAS cDNA sequences as references with NCBI accession numbers AB292682.1 and JQ437488.1, respectively. We also found one hit in the PBBK assembly to the gene producing the third product variant of this pathway, cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) using a cDNA sequence as a reference (Page and Stout 2017).We constructed a maximum likelihood (ML) tree using the default parameters in MEGA version 7 (Kumar et al. 2016) with the 16 CBDA/THCA synthase gene family from both assemblies to understand the relationships between them (Fig. 2). In order to discern the relationship between the CBDA/THCA synthase Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article-abstract/11/6/plz074/5634137 by guest on 23 December 2019Copyedited by: ASVergara et al. – Gene duplications in Cannabis sativa | 3gene family, we identified putative homologs of CBDAS/THCAS in closely related species using a tblastx search against NCBI’s non-redundant database. We chose tblastx in lieu of blastx because it allows comparison of nucleotide sequences without the knowledge of any protein translation (Wheeler and Bhagwat 2007). We included 14 sequences from three species from the order Rosales, two of them also from the family Cannabaceae—Trema orientale and Parasponia andersonii with four and three sequences, respectively—and a more distantly related species from the family Moraceae as an outgroup, Morus notabilis, with seven sequences. Therefore, our ML tree included a total of 30 putative CBDAS/THCAS homolog sequences, 16 from Cannabis, 7 from two other species in the Cannabaceae and 7 from the outgroup Morus. All sequences are deposited on Dryad digital repository (https://datadryad.org/stash/share/MsyF2os_zaKN6d9uoDLroX7O0RrW8kT8sPzep7WffLU).Finally, for the 16 sequences we found in the PBBK and PK assemblies, we calculated genetic distance and nucleotide composition using MEGA, and compared the non-synonymous to synonymous sites ratio between sequences with SNAP (Korber 2000).Genomic sequences, alignment and depth of coverage calculationWe used 67 Illumina platform whole-genome shotgun sequence libraries available from various Cannabis cultivars CoA-S OHexanoyl-CoACoA-S O OOH 3X Malonyl CoAOH HO COOH Olivetolic acid Olivetolic acid synthase Geranylpyrophosphate: olivetolate geranyltransferaseGeranyldiphosphateCannabigerolic acid OH HO COOH THCAsynthase OH O COOH CBDAsynthase CBCAsynthase Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid Cannabidiolic acid Cannabichromenic acid Nonenzymaticconversion Nonenzymaticconversion Nonenzymaticconversion OH HO COOH OH O OH HO 9 Tetrahydrocannabinol Cannabidiol CannabichromeneOH O OH O COOH OPP9 123Figure 1.

These groupings based on leaf morphology have been previously established (Clarke and Merlin 2013) and corroborated with genomic analyses (Lynch et  al. 2016; Vergara et  al. 2016). The 67 whole genomes used in this analysis have raw read lengths from 100 to 151 bp. The relationship between these 67 individuals has already been established and they have been assigned to these three lineages (broadly classified as broad-leaf, narrow-leaf and hemp). The classification of the drug-type lineages correlates strongly with leaf morphology, although it is important to note that the relationships were inferred based on genetic relatedness, rather than morphological characters. For detailed information on sequencing and the library prep these 67 genomes refer to Lynch et al. (2016).We aligned the 67 libraries to both assemblies using Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA) version 0.7.10-r789 (Li and Durbin 2009), then calculated the depth of coverage using SAMtools version 1.3.1-36-g613501f (Li et al. 2009). The expected coverage at single copy sites was calculated with the aligned data divided by the genome size [see Supporting Information—Table S2], estimated to be 843 Mb for male and 818 Mb for female Cannabis plants (Sakamoto et  al. 1998). Intrinsic similarity among paralogous genes—and thus probability that reads from different loci align to the same paralog—precluded establishing specific SNPs. However, we calculated the number of possible gene paralogs encoding each enzyme in the cannabinoid pathway (Fig. 1) for each cultivar using coverage from both assemblies. The estimated CN for each cannabinoid sequence was calculated as the average depth across that sequence divided by the expected coverage. This scaled depth was therefore used as a measure of gene CN for each cultivar.To determine the highest total number of genes per cultivar for CBDAS/THCAS, the depth of coverage was calculated for each library when aligned to the PBBK assembly that had been modified to include only one paralog (PBBK scaffold 001774).Gene CN statisticsDifferences in the estimated gene CN between the cultivars for each of the 16 in the CBDAS/THCAS gene family were determined using one-way ANOVAs on the CN of each gene as a function of the lineages (narrow-leaf, broad-leaf, hemp), with a later post hoc analysis to establish one-to-one group differences. Three ANOVAs were also performed for each of the lineages to determine within-group variation. The cultivars were then compared with either an ANOVA for cultivars with more than two samples (Carmagnola and Afghan Kush) or a paired 004650007396 006705 PK_scaffold3498001774PK_scaffold19603PK_scaffold50320PK_scaffold1330005134002936007887004341006591000395008242 PK_scaffold74778JXTC01000010:2079510-2081171 T. orientaleJXTC01000010:2160270-2161952 T. orientaleJXTC01000010:2185670-2187427 T. orientaleJXTC01000010:2231467-2233077 T. orientaleJXTB01000286:548333-549961 P. andersoniiJXTB01000484:234537-236165 P. andersonii4JXTB01000484:72593-74215 P. andersoniiXM 024167777:1-1647 M. notabilis cannabidiolic acid synthase-likeXM 024162862 M. notabilis THC acid synthase-likeXM 024168490:1-1644 M. notabilis cannabidiolic acid synthase-likeXM 024163960:17-1660 M. notabilis cannabidiolic acid synthase-likeXM 024163961 M. notabilis cannabidiolic acid synthase-likeXM 024164593:28-1623 M. notabilis cannabidiolic acid synthase-likeXM 024171228:15-1667 M. notabilis cannabidiolic acid synthase-like1001001009673100100100100981001007410099877785100Unknown cannabinoid synthasesCBDA synthase-like genesCBCA synthase-like genesTHCA synthase-like genesOut groupOther CannabaceaeFigure 2.

Briefly, data collection was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Agilent (1260 Infinity, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Shimadzu (Prominence HPLC, Columbia, MD, USA) equipment with 400–6000  mg of sample. We report the estimated total cannabinoid content calculated from the acidic and neutral form of each cannabinoid as in Vergara et  al. (2017) and used these values to obtain chemotypic averages for each cultivar. We had the specific chemotypes for eight cultivars which also were sequenced. In these cases, we used individual values instead of the averages [see Supporting Information—Table S3].CN vs. chemotype correlation.To evaluate the relationship between the estimated gene CN for each of the genes and chemotype, we performed PGLS correlations between the chemotype and the average estimated gene CN per gene [see Supporting Information—Methods and Results] while correcting for phylogenetic relatedness. Only cultivars with matching data in the genomic analysis were analysed, for a total of 35 individuals from 22 different cultivars. The broad-leaf group had 10 individuals from six cultivars, the narrow-leaf had 15 individuals from 13 cultivars, the hemp group had six individuals from one cultivar, and there were four individuals from three cultivars that were not assigned to any group (Lynch et al. 2016). The chemotype data represent 822 individuals from 22 unique cultivars. Some caveats of this analysis are that we averaged the chemotypes for most of the shared cultivars except for the eight cultivars for which we had the specific chemotype for that particular genotype [see Supporting Information—Table S3]. Additionally, since Cannabis cultivars are notoriously mislabelled (Sawler et al. 2015; Vergara et al. 2016), some of the values that are part of the averages could be ambiguous. However, an important strength of this average is that effects of environmental variation and statistical noise are minimized, improving our ability to assess genetically based variation. We also performed PGLS correlations to the sum of all cannabinoids to examine whether CN variation had an effect on overall cannabinoid content.Expression analysisAs a proxy measure of differential expression of the genes on the cannabinoid pathway, we aligned three published RNA sequences derived, respectively, from the flower and root of PK and the flower of the hemp cultivar Finola (van Bakel et al. 2011) to the whole PBBK assembly. We used the Tuxedo suite, which includes Bowtie2 v2.3.4.1 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) for RNA alignment, TopHat for mapping v2.1.1 (Trapnell et al. 2009) and Cufflinks v2.2.1 for assembling transcripts and testing for differential expression (Trapnell et al. 2010). We used CummeRbund’s output from the RNA-Seq results (Trapnell et al. 2012).Figure 5. Correlations between the percent THCA and the estimated CN for three CBDA/THCA synthase paralogs. The two CBDAS-like genes (panels A and B) and the one THCAS-like gene (panel C) are positively and significantly correlated at the P < 0.05 level to the percent THCA.

Two paralogs, located on contig 001774 and PK scaffold 19603, from the PBBK and PK assemblies, respectively, cluster together with 100 % bootstrap support and are related to genes known to be involved in THCA production. Similarly, the paralogs we infer to be CBDA synthases—two from the PBBK assembly (000395 and 008242)  and one from the PK assembly (74778)—also cluster together. We found a cluster of four genes, three from the PBBK assembly and one from the PK assembly, that we infer to be CBCA synthases. All genes used from the two other Cannabacea species T.  orientale and P.  andersonii cluster together. Similarly, the genes from the outgroup M.  notabilis also form a cluster, excluding the 16 Cannabis sequences.Gene CN statisticsThe one-way ANOVAs for each gene and post hoc analysis show that the CN of some of the paralogs differs among the three major cultivar groups (see Supporting Information—Table S4—between-group comparison). However, the post hoc analysis with the medians from the broad-leaf, narrow-leaf and hemp groups shows that hemp lineage differs from the other two groups in paralog CN, independent of which assembly was used as a reference.Hemp appears to differ the most from the other two lineages in the CN of the three CBDAS-like and the two THCAS-like paralogs both between and within lineages (Fig. 3), because for the three paralogs, the hemp lineage has the lowest mean [see Supporting Information—Table S4] and median (Fig. 3) CN.Phenotypic analysisCN vs. chemotype correlation.After correcting for relatedness, most correlations between the cannabinoid levels and the synthase gene CN lack significance both in the modified and original assemblies [see Supporting Information—Table S5]. However, the original assemblies had important significant correlations before correcting for relatedness [see Supporting Information—Table S5]. For CBD chemotypic abundance (after correcting for relatedness) CNs of one (008242) of the two CBDAS-like paralogs significantly but negatively correlate (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly, the THCAS-like paralog 001774 is also negatively but significantly correlated to CBD accumulation (Fig. 4C). For THC chemotypic abundance after correcting for relatedness, all CBDAS/THCAS paralog CNs show significant positive correlations (Fig. 5). All other correlations between chemotypic abundance and the multiple gene CNs are given in Supporting Information—Table S5. The PGLS correlations to the sum of all cannabinoids show similar patterns as the correlations to single cannabinoids. The patterns shown in Figs 4 and 5 are similar to the ones observed when using the PK genome as a reference (see Supporting Information—Fig. S2A and B for correlations with percent CBD and Supporting Information—Fig. S2C and D for correlations with percent THC).We found that paralog 006705 had the highest BLAST percent-identity score (99.93  %) to the cDNA from the CBCA synthase. Additionally, the two other paralogs that cluster in the same group (007396 and 004650; Fig. 1) also show a high-percent identity (99.87 and 99.81  %, respectively) to CBCA synthase. None of the 16 CBDA/THCA synthase-family paralogs correlate with the accumulation of CBC [see Supporting Information—Table S5] after correcting for relatedness. Additionally, the PGLS model with paralogs 007396, 004650 and 006705 did not show any significance. However, three different paralogs (50320, 002936 and 007887) with lower BLAST scores showed a significant correlation with CBC accumulation before correcting for relatedness.Expression analysisOur proxy expression analysis suggests differences in the gene products between cultivars and tissues (Table 1). Even though the differences are not significant, the marijuana-type cultivar PK seems to express the olivetolate geranyltransferase gene in greater quantities in its midflower than the midflower of Finola, Table 1. Expression for cannabinoid synthase-pathway genes. The expression level for the paralogs related to cannabinoid production varies in both cultivars and tissues. The first column shows each of the paralogs from the PBBK assembly; columns 2, 3 and 4 show the average FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), which is a measure of expression level proportional to the number of reads sequenced from that transcript after normalizing for transcript’s length, for transcript levels across runs and for the total yield of the sequencing instrument. Columns 5, 6 and 7 show the significance between the pairwise tissue comparison, and finally column 8 shows the group for each of the paralogs.ComparisonsParalogPK midflower (FPKM)Finola midflower (FPKM)PK root (FPKM)PK midflower–Finola midflowerPK midflower–PK rootFinola midflower–PK root Group003891 243.5 16.5 0 NS P < 0.05 NS Olivetolate geranyltransferase006591 4.39 0.22 0 NS P < 0.01 NS Unknown cannabinoid synthases007887 4.383 0.221 0 NS P < 0.0001 NS004341 4.38 0.22 0 NS P < 0.01 NS002936 4.24 0 0 P < 0.01 P < 0.01 NS005134 0 3.52 0 P < 0.01 P < 0.01 NS000395 0.084 2.516 0 NS NS P < 0.01 CBDAS-like008242 0.468 2.75 0 NS NS P < 0.03001774 484.73 1.48 0 P < 0.03 P < 0.0001 P < 0.03 THCAS-like007396 142.91 6.08 0 P < 0.001 P < 0.0001 P < 0.0001 CBCAS-like004650 140.94 5.67 0 P < 0.003 P < 0.0001 P < 0.0001006705 146.99 6.05 0 P < 0.003 P < 0.0001 P < 0.0001Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article-abstract/11/6/plz074/5634137 by guest on 23 December 2019Copyedited by: AS8 | AoB PLANTS, 2019, Vol. XX, No. XXthe hemp cultivar. The CBDAS-like paralogs are less abundant in Finola [see Supporting Information—Table S3], despite them being significantly more expressed when compared to PK’s midflower (Table 1). The THCAS-like paralog is expressed in higher levels in the marijuana-type plant PK, and this comparison is significantly different in the three tissues. The roots of PK seem devoid of transcripts of either the CBDAS or THCAS paralog, likely due to the lack of trichomes in this tissue. These results suggest considerable divergence in expression level, especially due to the two order-of-magnitude difference between the expression level of the CBDAS-like paralogs (000395 and 008242) and the THCAS-like paralog (001774).DiscussionIn this study, we estimated the CN for the genes encoding enzymes catalysing three of the main reactions of the biochemical pathway that produces cannabinoids (Fig. 1) in the plant C. sativa. Although CN variation in some genes involved in cannabinoid production has been previously reported (van Bakel et al. 2011; McKernan et al. 2015), here we estimate CN variation in multiple steps of the biochemical pathway in 67 Cannabis genomes from multiple varieties within the broad-leaf, narrow-leaf and hemp groupings (Lynch et al. 2016) using two genome assemblies constructed via complementary technologies.Our results suggest that synthases for the cannabinoid pathway are highly duplicated and that plants probably use and express the paralogs of these genes differently in specific tissues. Gene CN variation has also been found to be associated with SNP variation and both factors can influence gene expression (Stranger et  al. 2007). Our results suggest that this is the case for quantitative and qualitative (amount and type) cannabinoid diversity, which seems to be a product of sequence in agreement to previous research (Onofri et al. 2015), CN variation (McKernan et  al. 2015) and expression—after the results presented in this analysis. The effect of CN variation in relation to these mentioned factors that may affect cannabinoid phenotype is an important topic for further study.CBDA/THCA synthase familyThe lack of dN/dS value differences and the short genetic distance [see Supporting Information—Table S6] suggest that the THCAS/CBDAS gene paralogs arose from a recent duplication event and so have lacked time to accumulate changes. Clusters unique to each of the two assemblies (Fig. 2) suggest that either these clades were selectively lost from the opposing assembly or that there exist lineage-specific paralog combinations. The latter would imply that the acquisition and loss of paralogs is rapid enough to show polymorphism at the cultivar level. Interestingly, all three putative CBDAS paralogs from these two high-THCA marijuana-type assemblies bear premature stop codons (Fig. 2). This finding supports previous research that suggests that marijuana-type cultivars with high-THCA production lack fully functional CBDAS genes (van Bakel et al. 2011; Onofri et al. 2015; Weiblen et al. 2015).Gene CN statisticsThe difference in CN between hemp and the other two lineages for the three CBDAS-like and the two THCAS-like paralogs (Fig. 3) imply that a whole gene cluster was either lost in most of the hemp cultivars or was duplicated in the marijuana-type (broad-leaf and narrow-leaf) individuals. However, even though the hemp group has the lowest mean and median, for many of these genes it has the widest range in gene CN [see Supporting Information—Table S4], indicating the widest gene CN variation between the three lineages. Copy number for these genes differs little between the broad-leaf and narrow-leaf marijuana types, suggesting similar between-group diversity and higher within-group variation (Fig. 3). Our estimates indicate that some of the analysed individuals from the three different groups could have up to 10 copies of CBDAS/THCAS paralogs [see Supporting Information—Table S3].Phenotypic analysisCN vs. chemotype correlation.There is a positive correlation between accumulation of THC and CN for four of the five paralogs related to CBDA/THCA production, but negative correlation between these paralogs and the accumulation of CBD (Figs 4 and 5; see Supporting Information—Table S5). This suggests that increasing THCAS gene CN decreases CBDA production possibly due to competition for the mutual precursor, CBGA. Additionally, the THCAS allele from marijuana-type plants appears to be dominant over the THCAS allele from hemp after expression analyses of crossed individuals bearing these alleles, and the CBDAS gene seems to be a better competitor for CBGA even when functional copies of THCAS genes are present (Weiblen et al. 2015). This difference in affinity towards CBGA, and in performance from the various genes and alleles, implies significant contributions from both sequence variation and differences in expression of synthase paralogs to differential accumulation of cannabinoids.The positive correlation between the CN of the paralogs related to CBDA production (000395 and 008242; see Supporting Information—Table S7) suggests that these paralogs are physically proximal and were possibly copied in tandem (Weiblen et  al. 2015; Grassa et  al. 2018). This finding agrees with recent research suggesting that cannabinoid genes are found in close proximity, in tandem repeats, and surrounded by transposable elements (Grassa et al. 2018; McKernan et al. 2018) which make up between 43 and 65 % of the Cannabis genome (Pisupati et al. 2018). Both paralogs’ CN correlated with the PK paralog 74778 CN [see Supporting Information—Table S7], and the three paralogs cluster together (Fig. 2), implying that the 74778 paralog in the PK assembly is related to CBDA production. However, the CN of the THCAS-like paralog (001774) is not correlated to the CN from the THCAS-like paralog from the PK assembly (paralog 19603; see Supporting Information—Table S7) even though they are closely related (Fig. 2). Finally, our BLAST analysis to two other assemblies also shows that these cannabinoid genes are in close proximity [see Supporting Information—Table S8], as reported in their respective publications (Grassa et  al. 2018; McKernan et al. 2018).Another factor that can affect the correlation between synthase gene CN and THCA and CBDA levels is the presence of truncated genes. High-THCA marijuana cultivars seem to possess a truncated version of the CBDA synthase (van Bakel et al. 2011; Onofri et al. 2015; Weiblen et al. 2015). The presence of the truncated CBDAS paralogs can explain some of the points in Fig. 4 in the bottom right corner where, even though the estimated CN is high (high value on the X-axis), the amount of CBD produced is low (low value on the Y-axis) due to the premature termination and inability to produce the protein. Truncated genes have also been reported for THCA synthases (van Bakel et  al. 2011; Onofri et  al. 2015; Weiblen et  al. 2015); however, we do not see many samples in the bottom right corner with high CN and low THC production (Fig. 5).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article-abstract/11/6/plz074/5634137 by guest on 23 December 2019Copyedited by: ASVergara et al. – Gene duplications in Cannabis sativa | 9It is interesting that the individual hemp-type plants have the lowest mean and median CN for the three CBDAS/THCAS paralogs (Fig. 3; see Supporting Information—Table S4). We expected hemp types to have a higher mean CN of the two paralogs related to CBDA production, because of their higher production of CBDA compared to marijuana types (de Meijer et al. 1992; Rustichelli et al. 1998; Mechtler et al. 2004; Datwyler and Weiblen 2006). However, hemp individuals have a higher mean for other paralogs from the CBDA/THCA synthase family [see Supporting Information—Table S4] such as paralog 005134 which has a negative correlation with the production of THCA but positive for CBDA [see Supporting Information—Table S5]. Finally, recent research suggests that CBDA-dominant lineages seem to produce minor cannabinoids which are absent in certain THCA lineages, implying the loss of cannabinoid genes in these highly hybridized THCA-dominant cultivars (Mudge et al. 2018). Perhaps these paralogs found in the hemp lineages may be related to these minor cannabinoids, which is subject for further research. Because of the recent aggressive human selection for THCA (Volkow et al. 2014), selection for these other genes with yet unknown products is possible.Expression analysisVariation in expression profiles of the THCAS and CBDAS gene paralogs (Table 1) could be another major contributor to measured phenotypic differences among Cannabis cultivars, as seen for genes related to stress response in maize (Waters et al. 2017). This effect may be augmented by the fact that chemotype assays are generally performed on mature flower masses. Variation in transcription is seen for many of the CBDAS/THCAS paralogs by both tissue and cultivar, suggesting differential use of pathway genes. On the other hand, transcripts from most cannabinoid synthase paralog clades are transcribed in greater quantities by the marijuana cultivar PK in marked contrast to the hemp cultivar Finola (Table 1), implying that marijuana cultivars express more diversity in cannabinoid synthase genes, despite hemp having the widest range in gene CN [see Supporting Information—Table S4]. Copy number variation can correlate positively or negatively with gene expression (Stranger et  al. 2007), which could be the case for THCAS and CBDAS, as may be the particular case for paralog 008242 that has a significant negative correlation with CBDA production. Finally, our results suggest that the enzymes found upstream of the pathway (such as olivetolate geranyltransferase) may play an important role in the production of cannabinoids, which would be regulated by enzymes found in multiple steps of the pathway. However, in order to conclusively make these claims, further studies must include the chemotypes, transcriptomes and genomes of individual plants.CN variation and the cannabinoid pathwayThe ecological function of cannabinoids is still unknown; however, some suggest that cannabinoids are thought to abate stresses such as UV light or herbivores (Langenheim 1994; Sirikantaramas et  al. 2005). In other plant species such as potatoes and maize, species-specific secondary metabolites accumulating in glandular trichomes confer resistance to pests and the corresponding synthase genes are found in high CNs (Hardigan et  al. 2016; Waters et  al. 2017). This appears to be the case in Cannabis. Phytocannabinoid synthesis appears to be genus-specific and accumulation in glandular trichomes could be stress-related (Langenheim 1994; Sirikantaramas et al. 2005). Our results suggest that the CBDA/THCA synthase family has recently undergone an expansion. Previous studies have assumed that CBDAS was the ancestral gene and that THCAS arose after duplication and divergence (Onofri et al. 2015), but since no other species is known to share this biosynthetic pathway it is not possible to conclusively identify the ancestral state. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that these cannabinoid genes are specific to Cannabis. This is a unsettled topic, however, since there appears to be no remaining truly wild (non-feral) Cannabis populations, and even though recent research claims to have identified a homolog of CBDAS in Humulus lupulus (Padgitt-Cobb et  al. 2019), which is Cannabis’ closest related extant species, we think this may be a gene that is equally related to all cannabinoids found in Cannabis and therefore equally related to CBDAS and to the other cannabinoids.Regardless, duplication and neofunctionalization of ancestral synthase genes is a likely contributor to chemotype variability. Copy number variants can serve as a mechanism for species-specific expansion in gene families involved in plant stress pathways (Hardigan et al. 2016; Waters et al. 2017). Additionally, CN variation has been reported in gene families involved in stress response and local adaptation in plants (Hardigan et al. 2016; Waters et al. 2017), and other organisms (Van de Peer et al. 2017), perhaps explaining why all genes in the cannabinoid pathway have been highly duplicated.The high numbers of paralogs in the CBDAS/THCAS family support the notion that biosynthesis proteins that have fewer internal metabolic pathway connections have a higher potential for gene duplicability (Prachumwat and Li 2006; Yamada and Bork 2009). However, despite both olivetolic acid synthase and olivetolate geranyltransferase operating near the pathway hub, the respective estimated CNs of their paralogs are similar to the CN of CBDA/THCA synthase paralogs (Fig. 1; see Supporting Information—Table S4). Sequence similarity and physical proximity of extant paralogs in the genome (Weiblen et  al. 2015; Grassa et  al. 2018) promotes tandem duplication, again facilitating rapid expansion of the CBDA/THCA synthase family. Human selection since the ancient domestication of this plant has likely played a role, as it did with CN in resistance genes in the plant Amaranthus palmeri (Gaines et al. 2010) and in the starch digestion gene Amy2B during dog domestication (Ollivier et al. 2016). Finally, gene CN variation has been associated with SNP variation and both of these factors can influence phenotype expression (Stranger et al. 2007).Our study provides another example of the high association between the CBDA/THCA synthase gene family, which has a very particular relationship, compete for the same precursor molecule (Page and Boubakir 2014; Page and Stout 2017), have a similar chemical structure in their genetic sequence (Brenneisen 2007; Flores-Sanchez and Verpoorte 2008; Onofri et al. 2015) and may exemplify ‘sloppy’ enzymes (Auldridge et al. 2006; Franco 2011; Chakraborty et  al. 2013). These ‘sloppy’ enzymes could convert similar substrates (such as CBGA) into a range of slightly different products, such as CBDA, THCA or CBCA (Jones et al. 1991).CaveatsIn addition to the factors previously examined as contributing to the high intrinsic genomic complexity of cannabinoid synthesis pathway regulation, the possible misassembly of both genomes may further confound attempts at precise correlations. For instance, multiple genome assemblies find cannabinoid synthase genes to be clustered in close proximity (Grassa et al. 2018; McKernan et al. 2018), which is also supported by genetic mapping and inheritance data (Weiblen et al. 2015). However, in the PK genome assembly the cannabinoid synthases are found Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article-abstract/11/6/plz074/5634137 by guest on 23 December 2019Copyedited by: AS10 | AoB PLANTS, 2019, Vol. XX, No. XXin multiple distinct locations (Laverty et  al. 2019), which may represent true biological variation or errors in the PK assembly. Nevertheless, all of these studies support the presence of multiple distinct paralogs as members of the cannabinoid synthase gene family. Additionally, the finding of some synthases exclusively in one or the other assembly suggests data gaps in both genomes, although the differences may represent true biological variation due to the high amount of CN variation among the different Cannabis varieties. This second hypothesis, suggesting that these differences are true biological variation, is supported by our results presented here. Finally, having only full chemotype data from a single hemp cultivar is a limitation of our study. However, the high CBDA production of this cultivar and our findings of possible deletions in THCA synthase are supported by work which included many hemp genotypes (de Meijer et al. 1992; Rustichelli et al. 1998; Mechtler et al. 2004; Datwyler and Weiblen 2006).ConclusionsIn this work, we quantify and describe, in multiple ways, the surprisingly high amount of variation in one of the highest revenue-producing biochemical pathways in nature. This gene CN variation and its potential relationship to cannabinoid production has huge medical and agricultural implications. Given that the function of most of these paralogs (Fig. 2) is still unknown, there is potential that some of these genes encode synthases whose products may be of medical importance. Since most medical studies have been performed with the governmentally produced Cannabis that has little diversity and potency and does not reflect that produced by the private markets (Vergara et al. 2017; Schwabe et  al. 2019), this work opens the door for more in-depth research, suggesting specific plant lineages deserving of future study. In the agricultural realm, continued work in this area has huge implications for breeding. Because breeders and growers have selected for high levels of THCA (Volkow et al. 2014), our results suggest potential ways it would be possible to breed for higher levels of other cannabinoids and related compounds, including those coded by the still-unknown genes (Fig. 2). We hope this study will encourage further research on these genes, particularly as the world moves to legalize this plant.Returning to our three initial questions: (i) Do lineages differ in number of cannabinoid synthase paralogs? We found that the measured CN of these genes did vary, within and between lineages and possibly within named cultivars given by the differences in CN [see Supporting Information—Table S4]. (ii) Does cannabinoid content correlate with the number of respective synthase paralogs by cultivar? We found a positive correlation between the accumulation of specific cannabinoids and the CN of certain synthase paralogs. THCA levels are significantly and positively correlated with the CN of several of these paralogs (Figs 4 and 5; see Supporting Information—Table S5). Furthermore, the broad-leaf and the narrow-leaf marijuana types each have a higher mean and median for the CNs of genes related to the production of both THCA and CBDA relative to hemp cultivars. However, CBDA levels are negatively correlated with most of the paralogs related to its production, and the hemp cultivars paradoxically exhibit higher CNs for the PK contig 19603 THCAS-like paralog than for CBDAS paralogs [see Supporting Information—Fig. S1, Table S5]. We found both positive and negative correlations between the production of the other cannabinoids and the CN of some of the paralogs, making it difficult to associate particular cannabinoids with specific paralogs (Figs 3 and 4; see Supporting Information—Fig. S2). (iii) Do cannabinoid synthase paralogs vary in expression level by tissue and cultivar? We observed differential transcription levels of these genes by tissue in conjunction with cultivar (Table 1) which likely adds to the high complexity of correlating paralog CNs with cannabinoid accumulation.Finally, our findings motivate a pair of general breeding strategies. To boost production of THCA, select parents with higher CNs of THCAS paralogs, whereas for cultivars with more CBDA, select parents with fewer such paralogs. As cultivars express synthases from multiple points in the pathway differently (Table 1), all of these genes should be considered for breeding purposes. For exclusive production of either THCA or CBDA, cross cultivars bearing only truncated paralogs of the opposing synthase genes.Supporting InformationThe following additional information is available in the online version of this article—Table S1.
