Plant Science Today (Early Access). https://doi.org/10.14719/pst.1629 Abstract   Pseudodictamnus africanus (L.) Salmaki & Siadati is a perennial herb which naturally occurs in Namibia and South Africa. Southern Africa is character-ized by several indigenous medicinal plants and natural products that are widely used in traditional materia medica. However, there is dearth of infor-mation on botanical description, medicinal uses, plant parts used, prepara-tion and dosage, active ingredients and pharmacological effects of medici-nal plants like P. africanus in the public domain. Therefore, this study re-viewed the medicinal uses, active bioactives and biological activities of        P. africanus. A systematic review of electronic databases and pre-electronic sources with information on the botany, medicinal uses, herbal prepara-tions, active bioactives and pharmacological effects of P. africanus was con-ducted. No time limit was set for the research and all literature sources aligned with the scope of the research were included. This study showed that P. africanus is used as traditional medicine for liver problems, sores, wounds, heart problems, hysteria, skin ailments, headache, insomnia, fever, typhoid fever and respiratory problems. Pharmacological research identi-fied hispanolone, dehydrohispanolone, saponins, tannins, phenolics, flavo-noids, reducing sugars, resveratrol, triterpene steroids and essential oils. The crude extracts of P. africanus and essential oils isolated from the spe-cies exhibited antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, immunological and sedative-hypnotic activities. More research is needed to assert the medicinal and ethnopharmacological properties of the crude ex-tracts of P. africanus and phytochemical compounds isolated from the spe-cies, and also determine the toxicological effects of the species and its phy-tochemical compounds.

Salmaki & Siadati is an aromatic shrublet belonging to the Lamiaceae or Labiatae or sage or deadnettle or mint fami-ly. The majority of species belonging to the Lamiaceae family are aromatic and include widely used culinary and medicinal herbs. Such species include Ballota nigra L. indigenous to Europe and Asia, and naturalized in North America is reputed to treat stomach spasms, nausea, as a calming herb, sedative, persistent cough and nervous system disorders, especially minor sleeplessness in both children and adults (1).

Benth. (2) but Siadati et al. (3, 4) described genus Ballota L. as consisting of three herbaceous species confined to Europe, western Asia and the Mediterranean. Species classified under Pseu-dodictamnus Fabr. are herbaceous plants which naturally occur in the African and Mediterranean regions (3, 4). The synonyms of P. africanus include Ballota africana, Beringe-ria africana (L.) Neck., Beringeria crispa (L.) G. Don, Marru-bium africanum L., Marrubium crispum L., Marrubium lauri-folium Steud., Marrubium thouinii Schult. ex Weinm., Pseu-dodictamnus emarginatus (L.) Moench and Stachys africa-na (L.) Kuntze (2, 3). The English common names of P. afri-canus are African horehound, Cape horehound, English cat herb and horehound. Pseudodictamnus africanus is an ev-ergreen, perennial, aromatic, soft, greyish shrublet grow-ing up to 1.2 m in height (5, 6). Leaves are opposite, softly hairy, heart-shaped with toothed margins. Flowers are pale pink, purple, mauve or greyish white in colour, occur in spikes, arranged in dense whorls around the stem and alternating with each pair of leaves (7). Pseudodictamnus africanus has been recorded in rocky or disturbed places in southern Namibia, through the Eastern Cape, Free State and the Western Cape provinces in South Africa (Fig. 1) at an altitude from 0 to 1525 m above the sea level (8).  Pseudodictamnus africanus is an important source of tradi-tional medicines in the Eastern Cape, Free State and the Western Cape provinces in South Africa, and the species is listed in three monographs, “medicinal and magical plants of southern Africa: An annotated checklist” (9), “medicinal plants of the world” (1) and “medicinal plants of South Africa” (10). Similarly, arguments are on the leaf infusions or tinctures of P. africanus have potential in the develop-ment of new medicinal products as they are widely used for various medicinal applications (11). It was showed that in the Eastern Cape, Free State and the Western Cape prov-inces in South Africa, the leaves of P. africanus are often mixed with those of Stachys thunbergii Benth. (family La-miaceae) and Valeriana capensis Thunb. (family Caprifoli-aceae) as traditional medicines for asthma, bronchitis, hysteria and insomnia (12, 13). Pseudodictamnus africanus is mainly collected from the wild but also available in infor-mal herbal medicine markets and sold as bunches of dried and/or fresh material consisting of stems, leaves and sometimes mixed with flowers, fruits and roots. The leaves of P. africanus are also used as snack, vegetable, herbal tea and flavourant in South Africa (14, 15). In South Africa, the conservation status of P. africanus is categorized as Least Concern based on the International Union for Conserva-tion of Nature (IUCN) Red List Categories and Criteria ver-sion 3.1, indicating that the species is generally wide-spread and occurring in abundance with a low risk of ex-tinction (16). However, the popularity of P. africanus as medicinal plant species requires the need for a holistic conservation approach in its use and future management of the species in southern Africa. Given this background, the current investigation was conducted aimed at docu-menting the medicinal uses, active bioactives and biologi-cal activities of P. africanus.  The use of medicinal plants such as P. africanus in the management of diverse ailments is entrenched in the culture of indigenous people in southern Africa. From time immemorial, local communities have relied on medicinal plants to treat and manage diseases and ailments, and these plants also provide several health or pharmaceutical products. Some communities rely exclusively on medicinal plants as sources of medicines because they are the most affordable and easily accessible source of treatment in the primary healthcare system of the resource poor communi-ties and those people occupying marginal areas (17-19). It was argued that medicinal plants are an important aspect of the daily lives of many people and an important part of the African cultural heritage (10). Similarly, research re-vealed that there is an increase in the popularity of natural remedies and botanicals in modern world as is seen in the rapid growth of over-the-counter medicines, dietary sup-plements and functional foods (20). Therefore, there is need to fully explore the ethnopharmacological properties of plant species widely used as traditional medicines, fo-cusing on their therapeutic potential, phytochemical prop-erties, empirical evidence of their efficacies based on in vitro, in vivo and appropriate clinical tests and models.    Materials and Methods   A systematic review of electronic databases such as Taylor and Francis, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, SpringerLink, SciELO, Pubmed and Elsevier. Pre-electronic sources such as national, international journal and other scientific publications, dissertations, theses, books and grey literature with information on the botany, medicinal uses, herbal medicine preparations, active bio-actives and pharmacological effects of Pseudodictamnus africanus were used. No time limit was set for the research and all literature sources aligned with the scope of the research were included. The key words Pseudodictamnus africanus and commonly used synonym Ballota africana were used in combination with other key words such as “active bioactives of Pseudodictamnus africanus or Ballota africana”, “ethnobotany of Pseudodictamnus africanus or Ballota africana”, “medicinal uses of Pseudodictamnus africanus or Ballota africana”, “phytochemicals of Pseudo-Fig. 1.

Results and Discussion   Traditional medicinal uses of Pseudodictamnus africanus     The fresh or dried leaves, stems and aerial parts of P. afri-canus are mainly used as traditional medicine for liver problems, sores, wounds, heart problems, hysteria, skin ailments, headache, insomnia, fever, typhoid fever and respiratory infections (Table 1, Fig. 2). Research showed that in South Africa P. africanus is often mixed with Valeria-na capensis as traditional medicine for asthma, bronchitis, heart trouble, hysteria and insomnia (12, 21). Research showed that in South Africa, the leaves of P. africanus are often mixed with those of various Salvia species (family Lamiaceae) to treat and manage fevers and measles (10, 12). Similarly, research showed that in South Africa the leaves, roots and stems of P. africanus are often mixed with those of Lasiosiphon deserticola (Gilg) C.H. Wright (family Thymelaeaceae) and Lessertia frutescens (L.) Gold-blatt & J.C. Manning (family Fabaceae) as remedy for dia-betes and pain (21, 22). Other traditional medicinal uses of the fresh or dried leaves, stems and aerial parts of P. afri-canus supported by at least 5 literature records include colic and traditional medicine for arthritis, gastro-intestinal problems, haemorrhoids, high and low blood pressure, mouth infections and thrush, painful feet and legs, rheumatism, snake bite, stress and urinary problems (Table 1).

Similarly, reports are on a phenolic compound resveratrol from the leaves of P. africanus (62) while reports are on flavonoids, reducing sugars, saponins, tannins and triterpene steroids from the leaves (47). Other research carried out showed that P. africanus is a source of essential oils and diterpenoids (43). Similar compounds have also been identified from a closely related species, Ballota nigra and these phytochemical compounds in-clude diterpenoid lactones of the labdane type such as ballotenol, ballotinone, 7α-acetoxymarrubiin and preleosi-birin, flavonoid glycosides, phenylpropanoids and traces of volatile oil (1). The phytochemical compounds identified from different aerial parts and leaves of P. africanus are important and these findings could be used to explain the health benefits of the species (Table 1). The identified compounds isolated from the aerial parts and leaves of      P. africanus clearly highlight the importance of detailed and further investigations on active bioactives of the spe-cies in the aerial parts, leaves and stems as these organs remain the most widely utilised plant parts as traditional medicine.

Summary of pharmacological activities of the extracts and compounds isolated from different parts of Pseudodictamnus africanus   6    MAROYI   https://plantsciencetoday.online species included the following: antibacterial (28, 41, 62), antifungal (41), anti-inflammatory (56, 63), antinociceptive (47), immunological (41) and sedative-hypnotic (47) activi-ties. Antibacterial activities   Reports are on the assessment of the antibacterial effects of aqueous and methanol extracts of P. africanus leaves were tested using Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420) and Pro-teus mirabilis (ATCC 43071) against the disc diffusion ap-proach with chloramphenicol (10.0 µg) and ampicillin (2.0 µg) as positive controls (28). The methanolic extract exhib-ited weak activities against Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 43071) with the inhibition zone of 7.0 mm and minimum inhibito-ry concentration (MIC) values of 4278.0 µg/ml (28). The antibacterial effects of aqueous, petroleum ether, di-chloromethane and 80% ethanol extracts of P. africanus stems and leaves against Haemophilus parainfluenzae (ATCC 7901), Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 12344), Staph-ylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) were tested against the disc diffusion and microdilution methods using neomycin (50.0 µg/ml), ampi-cillin (50.0 µg/ml) and penicillin (50.0 µg/ml) as the posi-tive controls in the investigation (41). The extracts of the species showed activities against Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 12344), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) with MIC values with-in the range of 0.4 mg/ml to >12.5 mg/ml (41). Reports are on the assessment of the antibacterial effects of methanol and water extracts of P. africanus leaves tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) using the disc diffu-sion method with ampicillin (2.0 µgg) and chlorampheni-col (10.0 µgg) used as the positive controls (62). The water and methanolic extracts demonstrated the antibacterial effects againnst Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) with inhibition zone of 7.0 mm and 8.0 mm and MIC values of 379.0 µg/ml and 438.0 µg/ml respectively (62).  Antifungal activities  The antifungal effects of aqueous, 80% ethanol, petrolleum ethers and dichloromethane extracts of P. afri-canus leaves and stems using Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) against the microdilution method using the ampho-tericin B (50.0 µg/ml) as the positive control were assessed (41). The extracts of the species demonstrated activities against the experimental pathogens with the MIC and min-imum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) values within the of 1.6 mg/ml and >12.5 mg/ml (41). The preliminary antibac-terial and antifungal activities exhibited by P. africanus extracts are strongly linked to several physiological pro-cesses and activities which act against microbial growth and multiplication, hence the species is popular as tradi-tional medicine against gastro-intestinal problems, mouth infections and thrush, skin infections, respiratory infec-tions, sores, wounds and toothache. Although the research aimed at establishing the antibacterial and antifungal ac-tivities of P. africanus is noteworthy, the screened panel of bacterial and fungal microorganisms are inadequate in comparison to the documented microbial-related human and animal health conditions in southern Africa. There is need to evaluate antibacterial and antifungal activities of P. africanus against bacterial and fungal microorganisms that are of relevance to dermatological problems and res-piratory infections. There is obviously need to conduct in vivo and clinical tests as there are several limitations asso-ciated with the in vitro models (64). Anti-inflammatory effects   Reports are on the assessment of the anti-inflammatory effects of methanol and water extracts of P. africanus leaves and essential oils isolated from the species by eval-uating the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory effects which were tested using a threefold stepwise dilution approach using Tween®20 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as negative con-trols and nordihydroguaiaretic acid was used as the posi-tive control (56, 63). The essential oils exhibited                      5-lipoxygenase inhibitory effects which were supported by half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 30.0 ppm (56, 63). These results support the traditional use of the species in various inflammatory ailments and diseases ranging from microbial infection to injury that result in cell injury and death. Antinociceptive effects  Reports are on the assessment of the antinociceptive effects of methanol extracts of P. africanus leaves against the hot plate and the acetic acid writhing tests in mice (47). The extract of the species demonstrated the dose-dependent effects which were similar to the dose-dependent effects demonstrated by a positive control (47). These findings could be used to corroborate traditional uses of P. africanus extracts as traditional medicines for mechanical injury and sensory nervous system such as fever, inflammation, rheumatism, toothache, sores and wounds. Immunological activities    The immunological effects of the ethanolic crudes extracts of P. africanus leaves and stems were tested against the anti-histamine assay (41). The P. africanus leaves and stems extracts exhibited excellent affinity with histamine receptor binding of 90.0% to 95.0% respectively (41). More research is needed to correlate the traditional use of the species in various inflammatory ailments and diseases with the biological activities of crude extracts or com-pounds isolated from the species. Sedative-hypnotic effects    The sedative-hypnotic effects of methanol extract of            P. africanus leaves were tested against the pentobarbitone induced sleep and locomotor activity tests in mice (47). The extract of the species demonstrated the dose-dependent effects which were similar to the dose-dependent effects demonstrated by a positive control (47). Toxicity   The oral preparation and administration procedure involv-ing the methanol extracts of P. africanus aerial parts demonstrated the median lethal dose (LD50) of the species is probably over 4000.0 mg/kg in mice (47). Therefore, de-tailed studies focusing on evaluating the toxicological effects, particularly the long-term acute and chronic toxici-7 Plant Science Today, ISSN 2348-1900 (online) ty effects in vivo and animal models are recommended.   Conclusion   This study provided a summary of information on the me-dicinal uses, active bioactives and the pharmacological effects of P. africanus. Considering the high number of studies reporting on ethnomedicinal uses of P. africanus, there are still further avenues and opportunities to unravel the phytoconstituents and the biological activities of this species. Such advanced ethnopharmacological research on P. africanus will enable local communities in southern Africa to continuously utilize the species for human diseas-es and ailments.
