We provide a holographic description of non-strange multiquark exotics as compact topological
molecules by binding heavy-light mesons to a tunneling configuration in D8-D8¯ that is homotopic
to the vacuum state with fixed Chern-Simons number. In the tunneling process, the heavy-light
mesons transmute to fermions. Their binding is generic and arises from a trade-off between the
dipole attraction induced by the Chern-Simons term and the U(1) fermionic repulsion. In the heavy
quark limit, the open-flavor tetraquark exotics QQq¯q¯ and Q¯Q¯qq, emerge as bound Efimov states in
a degenerate multiplet IJpi = (00+, 01+) with opposite intrinsic Chern-Simons numbers ± 1
2
. The
hidden-flavor tetraquark exotics such as QQ¯qq¯, QQQ¯q¯ and QQQ¯Q¯ as compact topological molecules
are unbound. Other exotics are also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Several experimental collaborations [1–4] have re-
ported new multiquark exotic states such as the neutral
X(3872) and the charged Zc(3900)
± and Zb(10610)±,
a priori outside the canonical quark model classifica-
tion. More recently, the LHCb [4] has reported new
pentaquark states P+c (4380) and P
+
c (4450) through the
decays Λ0b → JΨpK−, JΨppi− [5], and five narrow and
neutral excited Ω0c baryon states that decay primarily to
Ξ+c K
− [6].
Some of the reported hidden-flavor tetraquark exotics
appear to be loosely bound hadronic molecules of two
heavy-light mesons [7–14], although other explanations
for their composition have been also suggested in [16–
18]. The first estimates of the open-flavor and compact
tetraquark exotics were made in the context of the bag
model [19], and the random instanton model with full
chiral and heavy quark symmetry in [20, 21], in line with
recent estimates using constituent quark models [22].
The reported pentaquark states with hidden charm ini-
tially suggested in [23], have been addressed by many [24–
27] including the newly reported neutrals Ω0c as discussed
in [28–31]. Given the difficulty to track QCD in the in-
frared, it is not easy to identify a first principle mecha-
nism for the formation of these multiquark states.
Most of the multiquark states reported so far involve

both heavy and light quarks but fall outside the realm of
the canonical quark model [22]. It is well established that
the light quark sector of QCD exhibits spontaneous chi-
ral symmetry breaking, while the heavy quark sector is
characterized by heavy quark symmetry [32]. Both sym-
metries are at the origin of the chiral doubling suggested
in heavy-light mesons [33, 34], and confirmed experimen-
tally in [35, 36]. It is therefore important that a the-
oretical approach to the multiquark states should have
manifest chiral and heavy quark symmetry, a clear orga-
nizational principle in the infrared, and should address
concisely the multi-body bound state problem.
The holographic principle in general [37–39], and the
D4-D8-D8¯ holographic set up in particular [40] provide a
framework for addressing QCD in the infrared in the dou-
ble limit of a large number of colors and strong coupling
λ = g2YMNc. It is confining and exhibits spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking geometrically. In leading or-
der in 1/λ, the light meson sector is well described by
an effective action on the fused D8-D8¯ branes that is
consistent with known effective theories [41]. The same
setup can be minimally modified to account for the de-
scription of heavy-light mesons as well, with full account
of heavy quark symmetry [42]. Light and heavy-light
baryons are dual to instantons and instanton-heavy me-
son bound states in bulk [42–48], providing a concise ap-
proach to the multi-body bound state problem. In a way,
the holographic construction provides a geometrical real-
ization of the Skyrmion and its variants [25, 49, 50], with-
out the shortcomings of the derivative expansion. Alter-
native holographic models for the description of heavy
hadrons have been developed in [51–53] without the dual
strictures of chiral and heavy quark symmetrty.

2The organization of the paper is as follows: in sec-
tion 2 we recall the geometrical setup for the derivation
of the heavy-light effective action with two light and one
heavy flavor. We detail the heavy-light Dirac-Born-Infeld
(hereafter DBI) action and the particular classical fields
of interest for the description of the holographic multi-
quark states. In section 3 we derive explicitly a class of
O(4) tunneling configurations with fixed Chern-Simons
(hereafter CS) number in D8-D8¯, that interpolate contin-
uously between a unit topological charge (fermion) and
zero topological charge (boson). We also derive their
associated fermionic zero modes. In section 4, we de-
tail how a heavy meson attached to the tunneling con-
figuration transmutes to a fermion. We also derive the
pertinent Hamiltonian on the moduli associated to the
topological molecule formed of heavy mesons attached
to the O(4) tunneling configuration. In the heavy quark
limit, the open-flavor and non-strange tetraquarks and
hexaquarks are found to be bound Efimov-like states.
The hidden-flavor tetraquarks are not bound. In gen-
eral, heavier exotics are not bound. Our conclusions are
in section 5. We provide two appendices for complete-
ness.
II. HOLOGRAPHIC HEAVY-LIGHT
EFFECTIVE ACTION
A. D-brane set up
The D4-D8-D8¯ setup for light flavor branes is stan-
dard [40]. The minimal modification that accomodates
heavy mesons makes use of an extra heavy brane as dis-
cussed in [42]. It consists of Nf light D8-D8¯ branes (L)
and one heavy (H) probe brane in the cigar-shaped ge-
ometry that spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry. A
schematic description of the set up for Nf = 2 is shown
in Fig. 1. We assume that the L-brane world volume con-
sists of R4 × S1 × S4 with [0− 9]-dimensions. The light
8-branes are embedded in the [0−3+5−9]-dimensions and
set at the antipodes of S1 which lies in the 4-dimension.
The warped [5− 9]-space is characterized by a finite size
R and a horizon at UKK .
B. DBI action
The effective action on the probe L-branes consists of
the non-Abelian DBI and CS action. After integrating
over the S4, the leading contribution in 1/λ to the DBI
action is

A†M = −AM and the labels M,N running over µ, z only
in this section. All units are given in terms of MKK = 1,
which is readily recovered by dimensional inspection.
The effective fields in the field strengths are [42]

We note that for only Nf > 2 it fails to reproduce the cor-
rect transformation law under the combined gauge and
chiral transformations [46]. In particular, when address-
ing the Nf = 3 baryon spectra, (5) does not treproduce
3the important hypercharge constraint [46], but can be
minimally modified to do that.
ForNf coincidental branes, the Φ multiplet is massless,
but for separated branes as illustrated in Fig. 1 they are
massive with the additional contribution

)
(6)
The value of mH is related to the separation between the
light and heavy branes, which is about the length of the
HL string. Below, mH will be taken as the heavy meson
mass.
C. Light fields
In the coincidental brane limit, light baryons are in-
terchangebly described as a flavor instanton or a D4
brane wrapping the S4. The instanton size is small with
ρ ∼ 1/√λ after balancing the order λNc bulk gravita-
tional attraction with the subleading and of order λ0Nc
U(1) induced topological repulsion [40].
To describe tetraquark states which carry zero topolog-
ical charge or baryon number, but are still tightly bound
by the underlying light gauge field in holography, we sug-
gest to use a tunneling configuration on the sphaleron
path that is homotopic to the vacuum state. The config-
uration will carry fixed Chern-Simons number. We will
seek it using the maximally symmetric O(4) gauge field
AM (y) = −σMN∂NF (y) Fzm(y)||y|=R = 0 (7)
subject to the condition of zero ′electric′ field strength at
the turning point R = ρ. From here on M,N runs only
over 1, 2, 3, z unless specified otherwise. If ρ ∼ 1/√λ is
the typical size of these tunneling configuations, then it
is natural to recast the DBI action using the rescaling
(x0, xM )→ (x0, xM/
√
λ),
√
λρ→ ρ
(A0, AM )→ (A0,
√
λAM ) (8)
The rescaled fields satisfy the equations
DMFMN = 0 ∂
2
MA0 = −
1
32pi2a
FaMN ? FaMN (9)
with the use of the Hodge dual notation, subject to the
turning point condition (7) in leading order in 1/λ. The
detailed solution to (9) will be given below. Unlike the
instanton which is stable, these tunneling configurations
are unstable and tend to relax to the vacuum state. They
are the O(4) analogue of an instanton-anti-instanton con-
figuration running to its demise through the valley. Be-
low, we will show that they can stabilize quantum me-
chanically when heavy mesons bind to them.
D. Heavy-light fields
Let (Φ0,ΦM ) be the pair of heavy quantum fields that
bind to the tunneling configuration above. If again ρ ∼
1/
√
λ is their typical size, then it is natural to recast the
heavy-light part of the DBI action using the additional
rescaling
(Φ0,ΦM )→ (Φ0,
√
λΦM ) (10)
The interactions between the light gauge fields (A0, AM )
and the heavy fields (Φ0,ΦM ) to quadratic order split to
several contributions [42]
L = aNcλL0 + aNcL1 + LCS (11)
which are quoted in the Appendix for completeness. Here
we only need the leading contributions stemming from
(11) in the additional heavy mass limit mH → ∞. For
that, we split ΦM = φMe
−imHx0 for particles (mH →
−mH for anti-particles). The leading order contribution
takes the form
L0 = −1
2
|fMN − ?fMN |2 + 2φ†M (FMN − ?FMN )φN
(12)
subject to the constraint equation DMφM = 0 with
fMN = ∂[MφN ] +A[MφN ] (13)
while the subleading contributions in (11) to order λ0mH
simplify to
L1
aNc
→ 4mHφ†M iD0φM
LCS → mHNc
16pi2
φ†M ? FMNφN (14)
For self-dual light gauge fields with FMN = ?FMN ,
the last contribution in (12) vanishes, and the minimum
is reached for fMN = ?fMN . This observation when
combined with the transversality condition for DMφM =
0, amounts to a first order equation for the combination
ψ = σ¯MφM with σM = (i, ~σ), i.e.
σMDMψ = Dψ = 0 (15)
as noted in [42]. In a self-dual gauge configuration,
the heavy spin-1 meson transmutes to a massless spin- 12
spinor that is BPS bound in leading order. For the tun-
neling configuration in (7) the self-duality condition no
longer holds. With this in mind, we now proceed to deter-
mine first the explicit tunneling configuration (A0, AM )
by solving (9), and then its variational zero mode.
4III. TUNNELING FIELD AND ITS FERMIONIC
ZERO MODE
In this section we detail the construction of a family of
O(4) symmetric tunneling configurations (7) solution to
(9). They carry fractional Chern-Simons number at the
turning point, and interpolate parametrically between
the instanton and the sphaleron configuration at the
turning point when continued to Minkowski space. Their
O(3) symmetric relatives through a conformal transfor-
nation are discussed in the Appendix. We note that
similar configurations were used in the context of ex-
plosive sphalerons and their applications to finite energy
collisions [54–56]. We also derive their corresponding
fermionic zero modes, which will prove useful for the dis-
cussion of the heavy-meson bound states through trans-
mutation.
A. O(4) tunneling configuration
Consider the O(4) static and symmetric ansatz for the
SU(2) gauge configuration
AaM (y) = 2 η¯aMN
yN

f(ξ) (16)
with the conformal variable ξ(y) = 12 ln(y
2/ρ2). The anti-
instanton and anti-sphaleron configurations follow from
a similar construction with a dual background η¯ → η.
In terms of (16) the static O(4) symmetric part of the
Yang-Mills action in (1) without warping reads

with T the length of time, the induced effective coupling
for the flavor gauge fields g2κ = 1/κ, and the double well
potential
V (f) = 2(ff¯)2 (18)
with f¯ = 1−f . The O(4) profile f(ξ) extremizes (17) by
satisfying
d2f
dξ2
= 4(f2 − f)(2f − 1) . (19)
which is of the Jacobi type. Remarkably, the solution to
(19) with a sphaleron-like turning point at ξ = 0 with
f ′(ξ = 0) = 0, can be found explicitly

as illustrated in Fig. 2. In general, the solution (20)
carries Chern-Simons number Nk and energy Ek at the
turning point, that are tied through the profile of the

with N1 = 1 the instanton topological charge, and

solution with N1 = 1 is self-dual. All the other config-
urations with Nk < 1 are extrema rather than minima,
and therefore prone to decay. They are homotopic to the
vacuum state.
For the holographic dual hadronic configurations, the
more relevant quantity is the action (17) for the gener-
alized tunneling configurations (20). Since the solutions
are periodic reflecting on the periodicity of the sphaleron-
ridge, we have for the fundamental period the action

be read from (25) as Mk = Sk/T . We note that the holo-
graphic mass ratio at the sphaleron to instanton point is

B. U(1) gauge field
The U(1) gauge field in (9) is sourced by the local
topological charge density carried by the O(4) tunneling
configuration (16). For that, it is useful to determine the
field strength FMN and its dual ?FMN , or more explicitly

(32)
which is identically zero at the sphaleron point since

It interpolates continuously between the sphaleron path
at k = 0 with zero topological charge, and the instanton
path at k = 1 with unit topological charge.

of the other. Note the difference between the preceding
conventions and the hermiticity of the gauge field in this
section only. If we note that the t′ Hooft symbol satisfies
the color identity
σ¯McσNc = σacηaMN (38)
with the color matrices σMc = (1,−i~σc), then the posi-

Note that while writing (39) we have added a U(1) part

formally using
ψ+ = ϕχQ (χQ)aµ = aµ (41)

IV. MULTIQUARK EXOTICS AS
TOPOLOGICAL MOLECULES
In the triple limit of a large number of colors Nc, strong
coupling λ and heavy meson mass mH , the holographic
multiquark exotics can be constructed by attaching to the
O(4) tunneling gauge configuration an arbitrary number
of heavy-light mesons. Of course, in reality only a few can
stick. The fermionic repulsion induced through a U(1)
coupling to the Chern-Simons term stabilizes the tunnel-
ing configurations viewed as an instanton-anti-instanton
process.
A. Heavy bound meson
For k = 1 with net topological charge 1, the heavy me-
son field in the self-dual classical background (7) trans-
mutes to a fermionic zero mode (15) as initially noted
in [42]. For k < 1 which is the case of interest with frac-
tional topological charge (fixed Chern-Simons number),
the classical background (7) is no longer self-dual and
the minimum of (12) can be solved using a variational
fermionic ansatz of the type (15)
7φM → σMψ+ ≡ σMg(r)χQ (48)
with the radial coordinate r = |y|. In terms of (48) the

verse DMφM = 0 for all values of k. In [42] χQ → χQ(t)
describes the induced fermionic moduli upon binding,
which is how the heavy quark of the original heavy-light
meson manifests itself in this limit.

The contribution to (56)
−2mH(φ†0iDMφM − c.c) = 0
drops out for any k, thanks to the transversality of the
zero-mode (48). We recall that for k = 1 the tunneling
configuration is self-dual but not otherwise. This configu-
ration is an instanton with topological charge 1, and (56)
describes the action of holographic heavy baryons [42].

We fix the region of integration B to the period Tk in (21)
or B = [−Tk2 , Tk2 ], with the boundary conditions specified
earlier. The integrals in (62) for α1,2(k) are not reducible
to single integrals upon the insertion of (63) and integra-
tion by parts, since e2ξ−3F does not integrate to a simple
function.
The first contribution in (60) is the holographic mass
(25) of the tunneling configuration of order λNc, which
is seen to reduce to the instanton mass (action) for
k = 1. The second contribution is the mass of the
attached heavy quarks in the mesonic molecule. The
contribution linear in λ stems from the boundary term
for the quadratic heavy meson action. It is non-zero
for 0 ≤ k < 1 due to the deviation of the tunneling
gauge configuration from self-duality. The α1 contri-
bution stems from the U(1) Coulomb coupling of the
charge χ†χ to the background charge ρ0 and the Chern-
Simons terms.The (χ†χ)2 contribution stems from the
U(1) Coulomb-like self-interaction. All of these contri-
butions are similar to the k = 1 case with the exception
of the α0-contribution.
The behavior of α0,1,2(k) versus k is shown in Figs. 5-7
respectively. Eq. α0(k) is maximally repulsive at k = 0
reflecting on the maximal deviation from self-duality, and
vanishes at the self-dual point with k = 1 in agreement
with [42]. Eq. α1(k) is attractive for all k with the ex-
pected value α1(1) = − 18 from [42]. Eq, α2(k) is repulsive
throughout with the limiting value α2(1) =

ment with [42].

D. Classical binding energy
In general the treatment of the size ρ requires quantum
mechanics as we detail below. However, for a classical

We fix the holographic parameters to: Nc = 3, λ =

√
0.67 ≈ 1 GeV [44]. For
NQ = 2, we show in Fig. 8 the classical binding energy
∆H(0) versus mH in units of MKK . We recall that k = 0
corresponds to the sphaleron path with zero topologi-
cal charge. For charm and bottom, mH is fixed to the
(0−, 1−) multiplet, i.e. mD ≈ 1.870 GeV for (D,D∗)
and mB ≈ 5.279 GeV for (B,B∗). The classical binding
of both charm and bottom is large and depends sensi-
tively on the value of ρ. In the heavy quark limit with
mH → ∞, the classical binding disappears when the re-
pulsion (α2) exceeds the attraction (α1) modulo Mk, i.e.
NQ/Nc > 6|α1(0)|/α2(0) ≈ 1.22. A more accurate esti-
mate of the binding requires a quantum treatment as we
now discuss.
E. Quantum moduli
The quantum moduli space of the O(4) tunneling
configurations is analogous to the instanton moduli or
R4 × R4/Z2 (flat space) [40]. Here we focus on R4/Z2
which corresponds to the size and global flavor SU(2)
orientations.We will refer to yI = ρaI as the coordinates
on R4/Z2, with the SU(2) orientations parametrized by
aI subject to the normalization a

I = 1, and to ρ as the
size of the instanton. The collective Hamiltonian on the

In Fig 9 we show (68) versus k, which is seen to increase
monotonously with the topological charge, from q(0) =
0 on the sphaleron path to q(1) = 1 on the instanton
path [42].
All contributions in (67) are in principle leading in the
triple limit Nc > λ > mH  1 provided that NQ/Nc is of
order 1. However, in practice some of the the inequalities
may not be fulfilled. This is a known shortcoming of the
holographic construction, where for instance λ > Nc is
used in most applications [40, 44, 57].
For NQ = 0, the eigenstates of (66) are given by
Tl(a)Rln, where Tl(a) are the spherical harmonics on S

(73)
The occurence of the 1/ρ2 potential at short distances,
stems from the nature of the attraction in (60) which
is dipole-like and the repulsion in (60) which is U(1)-
like and Coulombic in 4-spatial dimensions. It is dom-
inant at small distances, with the critical coupling of
− 14 for the formation of deep bound states below the
heavy meson threshold. Throughout, binding means that
Ek,nl −NQmH < 0.
In Fig. 10 we show the behavior of sl(x) ≡ gl(0) + 14
as a function of x = NQ/Nc with mH → ∞, on the
sphaleron path (zero topological charge), for l = 0 lower
(blue) curve, l = 1 middle (orange) curve and l = 2 upper
(green) curve. Only for l = 0 and x = NQ/Nc < 1.2 is the
attraction sufficiently strong to form deep bound states.
Higher waves with l = 1, 2, ... are unbound. For Nc = 3,
only NQ ≤ 3 states are a priori bound, i.e. open-flavor
tetraquark QQq¯q¯ and hexaquark QQQq¯q¯q¯ states. The
S-wave tetraquark states QQq¯q¯ carry IJpi = 00+, 01+
assignments with Chern-Simons number + 12 , and are de-
generate.

For g0(k) +

4 < 0, the potential in (74) is sufficiently
attractive to form deep bound states. However, it is sin-
gular and requires regularization [58]. The scale invari-
ance of (74) allows for a universal regularization using
the renormalization group approach, whereby the depth
of the attractive and singular potential, can be chosen to
be a function of a short distance cutoff RS [58]. As a re-
sult, (74) admits many S-wave bound states with an accu-
mulation near threshold, the so-called Efimov states [59].
We note that in our case, there is a minimal value for the
cutoff Rmin = 1/mH , so the number of bound states is
limited.
The bound state spectrum for (74) was detailed in [58]
with extensive analysis in the context of the renormal-
ization group cycle, with the result

In (75) the scale r0 is fixed by the curvature or range
of the long distance 1/ρ2 potential. From (71) we fix it
by matching the strength of the short distance potential
to the strength of the large distance harmonic potential,
i.e. r20 = 1/(mkω1). As a result, the quantum binding
energy (73) becomes

the binding energies of the tetraquark states QQq¯q¯ and
hexaquark states QQQq¯q¯q¯ are listed in the first column
of Table I-II respectively. The binding energies are not
very sensitive to 10 ≤ λ ≤ 20. For bottom B-mesons
with mB = 5.279 GeV and charmed D-mesons with
mD = 1.87 GeV, the binding energies for tetraquark and
hexaquark states are also listed in Table I-II respectively.
The hexaquark states are unbound for finite masses.
We note that for the bound tetraquark states, the Efi-
mov factor is e−2pi/ν0,2/3 ≈ 10−3. This factor in the
geometrical ratio (76) shows that the radially excited
tetraquark exotics rapidly move to the continuum and
unbind. So we expect only one bound state to survive.
The heavy multiquark states with hidden-flavor are
also covered by the present analysis provided that NQ →
NQ − NQ¯ is substituted in (67) when NQ > NQ¯. For
NQ < NQ¯ the starting O(4) tunneling configuration
should be an anti-instanton path with topological charge
−1, interpolating to an anti-sphaleron path with Chern-
Simons number − 12 . This implies conjugate symmetry
for bosonic multiquark states. As a result, the conju-
gate tetraquark states Q¯Q¯qq are bound and degenerate

with NQ → NQ − NQ¯ = 0 are unbound. Heavier

NQ → NQ −NQ¯ = 1 are unbound, but those of the type
QQ(QQ¯)pq¯q¯ with NQ −NQ¯ = (p+ 2)− p = 2 are bound
in the heavy quark limit.
The holographic exotics with hidden-flavor QQ¯qq¯ with
NQ → NQ − NQ¯ = 0, are also unbound. Experimental
evidence in [1–4] suggests otherwise. This shows that
the X,Y,Z states reported in [1–4] are not the compact
topological molecules discussed here, but likely loosely
bound hadronic molecules (deusons) [7–14]. Finally, we
also note that the present analysis is limited to the light
SU(2) flavor sector. The extension to the SU(3) flavor
sector with massive strange quarks is more involved [42]
and will be discussed elsewhere.
H. Discussion
Recent lattice and phenomenological estimates suggest
that the double-bottom tetraquark state is deeply bound
with ∆BB = −(0.15−0.2) GeV [60] (lattice) and ∆BB =
−(0.17) GeV [22] (and references therein). The same
lattice analysis suggests that the mixed charm-bottom
tetraquark state is bound ∆CB = −(0.061− 0.015) GeV,
but the the double-charm tetraquark state is not [60].
Our holographic results support a double-bottom
tetraquark state with a binding energy ∆BB = −(0.088−
0.091) GeV somewhat lower than the lattice estimate, a
mixed bottom-charm tetraquark with a binding energy
∆CB = −(0.064 − 0.080) GeV closer to the lattice esti-
mate, and a bound double-charm tetraquark with a bind-
ing energy ∆CC = −(0.041− 0.072) GeV contrary to the
lattice estimate. These results are overall consistent with
earlier estimates in the context of the random instanton
model [21].
Finally, we note that multiquark exotics in the con-
text of holography have been recently addressed in the
context of the holography inspired stringy hadron model
(HISH) [53]. We view our analysis as complementary
to the HISH analysis as it applies to the low lying ex-
otics as opposed to the highly excited and stringy ex-
otics. Our analysis can be extended to the excited
and unbound exotic states for slow rotations, with the
rotational-vibrational spectrum for l > 0

following from (66-67) through standard arguments [40,
42]. The states described by (70) are unstable against
the strong decay to heavy-light mesons. For l  1 the
spectrum (79) does not reggeize since E0,nl ≈ l. A way
to achieve reggeization is through relativistic rotations,
that allow for a stringy-like deformation of the underly-
ing O(4) tunneling configuration. This will be discussed
elsewhere.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a top-down holographic approach
to multiquark exotic states using a minimally modified
D4-D8-D8¯ set up to account for two light and one heavy
flavor [42]. The heavy multiquark states are topological
molecules of heavy-light mesons bound to a tunneling
gauge configuration with fixed Chern-Simons number.
The latter interpolates between an instanton path with
net topological charge 1 or baryon number (a fermion),
and a sphaleron path with net topological charge 0 and
Chern-Simons number 12 (a boson).
The geometrical interpolation between a fermion and
a boson in higher dimensions, is remarkable. It points to
a topological duality between the heavy baryon exotics
discussed in [42], and the heavy meson exotics addressed
here. This is suggestive of a geometrical realization and
generalization of the Savage-Wise symmetry [61] to most
heavy exotics.
In leading order in the heavy quark limit, the bounded
heavy mesons to the tunneling path with fixed Chern-
Simons number transmute to fermions. This mechanism
is reminiscent of the transmutation of the strange quark
spin to the Skyrmion in the kaon-Skyrmion bound state
[62]. The binding of the fermions follows by balancing
the attraction induced by the Chern Simons term which
is dipole-like, and the dual repulsion stemming from the
induced U(1) gauge field together with the deviation of
the tunneling configuration from self-duality which are 4-
dimensional Coulomb-like. The ensuing potential in the
molecule is singular. As a result the topologically bound
exotics are Efimov states.
Our analysis shows that only the open-flavor molecules
with x = NQ/Nc < 1.2 are bound in the heavy quark
13
limit. For Nc = 3, the open-flavor exotics QQq¯q¯ and
their conjugate Q¯Q¯qq are bound in a degenerate mul-
tiplet IJpi = (00+, 01+) with opposite intrinsic Chern-
Simons numbers ± 12 . The open-flavor and non-strange
hexaquark states QQQq¯q¯q¯ are bound in the heavy quark
limit only. The heavier exotics QQQ¯Q¯ are unbound. The
compact exotics with hidden-flavor such as QQQ¯q¯ and
QQ¯qq¯ are also unbound, but the heavier exotics such as
QQ(QQ¯)q¯q¯ are bound in the heavy quark limit.
The leading holographic correction in the heavy quark
mass is found to penalize the binding in ccq¯q¯ more than
in bbq¯q¯. Our analysis suggests a rotational-vibrational
tower of multiquark excitations prone to strong decay.
Some of the shortcomings of the present approach lie
in the use of the triple limits of large Nc, large coupling λ,
and large meson mass mH . Although the relaxation of
these limits is straightforward in principle, its system-
atic implementation is involved in practice. This not
withstanding, the present setup is noticeable because of
the limited number of parameters it carries. The brane
tension κ ∼ λNc is usually traded for the pion decay
constant, and the KK scale for the rho meson mass all
in the light meson sector, leaving the treatment of the
heavy-light sector parameter free modulo the heavy me-
son masses mH .
Unlike most of the approaches for heavy exotics [63]
(and references therein), the present construction en-
forces heavy quark symmetry, the spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry, provides a systematic organizational
framework using the QCD parameters Nc, λ,mH , and
solves the multi-body problem using topological bound
states.
The construction can be improved in a number of ways.
For instance, by breaking isospin symmetry and including
strangeness to account for strange topological exotics, or
by adding a tachyon and a tachyon potential to bring the
model closer to QCD at short distances, perhaps in the
context of improved holographic QCD [64]. These and
related issues will be discussed next.

VIII. APPENDIX II: O(3) SYMMETRIC
TUNNELING SOLUTION AND ITS FERMIONIC
ZERO MODE
In this Appendix we suggest yet another tunneling con-
figuration with O(3) instead of O(4) symmetry that is
also suitable for binding heavy-light mesons which is fully
localized in flat R4. This configuration is characterized
by a turning point in the holographic direction at z = 0,
in agreement with the explosive sphaleron configurations
discussed in [54–56]. To construct it, we note that the
O(4) solutions to the Yang-Mills equations with a turn-
ing point at ξ = 0 relates to the solution with a turning
point at z = 0 by the inversion
(x+ a)M =
2ρ2
|y + a|2 (y + a)M (82)
with a = (~0, ρ), which maps the sphere y2 = ρ2 onto the
upper-half of the x-space as illustrated in Fig. 13. This
inversion leaves the line element in R4 unchanged modulo
a conformal weight σ(y)
|dy|2 = σ(y) |dx|2 = |y + a|
4
4ρ4
|dx|2 (83)
and leaves invariant the 1-form of the gauge field
dxµAµ(x) = dyνAν(y) (84)
This leads to the transform
14
AaM (x) =√
σ(y)
(
gMN − 2 (y + a)M (y + a)N
(y + a)2
)
AaN (y)
(85)
with y solving (82).
We now proceed to construct the O(3) symmetric zero
mode by applying the spatial inversion (82) onto the O(4)
symmetric zero mode in (46) through
ψ˜+(x) =
σ†µ (y + a)µ
1/(y + a)2
ψ+(y) (86)
More explicitly, we have (r = |~x|)
ψ˜+(r, z) =
8ρ6C
((z + ρ)2 + r2)2
× ((z + ρ) + i~σ · ~x) e− 32F (ξ(y)) χQ
(87)
with
ξ(y) =
1
2
ln
(
(z − ρ)2 + r2
(z + ρ)2 + r2
)
(88)
This result is in agreement with the one derived in [56]
prior to the analytical continuation to Minkowski space
(see their Eq. 22 with a minor correction of the 2 to 32
in their exponent).
